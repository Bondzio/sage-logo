<abstract>
<p>This article draws on the content of four linked seminars in a series entitled ‘Thinking in Practice: Ensuring quality in the supervision of offenders in the community’ which offered practitioners and managers from probation and youth justice services some ‘reflective space’ to critically engage with current knowledge and research around a range of topics including risk assessment tools, compliance and desistance theory, responsivity in supervision (offenders and staff), and the future shape of offender management provision. The series valued not only knowledge derived from research and theory, but also the exercise of professional judgement developed through experience and reflection. This account of contributions from speakers and subsequent discussions highlights the dangers of over prescriptive and simplified solutions to complex problems, and a consequent diminution of professional confidence in using judgement. It also suggests that there is the potential for practice to develop in positive directions, ones that will engage the enthusiasm and optimism of both practitioners and managers. The centrality of making space for ‘thinking in practice’ is reaffirmed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over recent years work with adult and young offenders has taken place in a target-driven and risk conscious climate. Aspects of the work that require strict accountability and quantitative measurement have taken over from more reflective, qualitative ones – ticking boxes as opposed to thinking about different ways of working effectively. It has been argued that this can result in a sense of insufficient time to work effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0264550512470188">Davies, 2009</xref>) and a lowering of staff morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0264550512470188">Annison et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0264550512470188">Farrow, 2004</xref>), increasing the stresses of the job for both practitioners and managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0264550512470188">Davies and Gregory, 2010</xref>). It could also be argued that the drive to meet targets has the potential to impact negatively on the quality of practice by reducing the time for planned one-to-one work with offenders and for reflection on practice and the development of knowledge. This in turn could affect practitioners’ commitment and motivation to explore new ways of working and in time this could impact negatively on their confidence to exercise professional judgement rather than just ‘follow the rules’.</p>
<p>This article argues that effective practice requires time for both proper engagement with offenders and reflection on work undertaken, plus the opportunity to build on knowledge by keeping up-to-date with current research and theoretical literature relating to work with offenders. It draws on the content of a series of four linked seminars which took place in the Midlands between May 2009 and December 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0264550512470188">2</xref></sup> Entitled ‘Thinking in Practice: Ensuring quality in the supervision of offenders in the community’, the series aimed to promote thinking and debate about the professional task of supervision – both of offenders and of those responsible for supervising them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0264550512470188">3</xref></sup> Each seminar was designed to offer practitioners and managers from both probation and youth justice services some ‘reflective space’ to engage with current knowledge around specific topics and to have an opportunity to debate how these might inform practice. While this article engages with the content of the seminars, other members of the Steering Group have written more broadly about the rationale and history of the seminars and the potential contribution that the model could make to the development of post-qualifying probation practice in the UK and more widely in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0264550512470188">Farrow et al., 2011</xref>). </p>
<p>The first three seminars (our focus here) addressed direct practice and the final one considered the future organizational context of work with offenders. Uncertainty about the future in terms of both the structure of services and the impact of public sector spending cuts were consistent themes underpinning the responses of those attending all four seminars. Other themes to emerge included the importance of the offender perspective and involvement in the assessment and supervisory process; threats to professionalism in the current climate; concerns about maintaining and updating the knowledge and skill base of practitioners; managing tensions between the use of discretion and consistency of practice. The article draws on a number of these to examine what the authors are calling the ‘art of thinking in practice’. Specifically this involves managing the pressures inherent in the job whilst remaining open to and using new knowledge and research findings regarding work with offenders. It is argued that it is this ‘art’ that has been marginalized in a climate in which technical ‘solutions’ are prioritized in order to process offenders more efficiently through their orders. </p>
<p>The article starts by setting the background context to the seminar series and briefly reviewing theories of learning and professional development. It goes on to outline some of the topics and themes arising from keynote speaker presentations and subsequent discussions, drawing out specific issues and implications for practice that manager and practitioner participants identified. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0264550512470188">
<title>Background context</title>
<p>The one-day seminars were devised in 2007 by a cross-agency steering group consisting of academics and trainers, all working in the area of criminal justice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0264550512470188">4</xref></sup> Central to the conception of the seminars was the sense that issues such as quality in practice and the importance of professional judgement were being marginalized in the drive to meet targets. There was also a collective awareness of the difficulty of new research and theoretical knowledge having any real impact on the understandings of practitioners and hence the experiences of offenders moving through the criminal justice system. Members of the Steering Group also shared a belief in the centrality of relationships in work with offenders, and that for relationships between offenders and those supervising them to be effective, practitioners need to be equipped with up-to-date knowledge from theory and research and given the space and time to engage with that knowledge, apply it to their practice, and reflect and learn from the experience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0264550512470188">Evans and Hardy, 2010</xref>). </p>
<p>Developments nationally mirrored this; over the course of planning and delivering the four seminars the National Offender Management Service’s (NOMS) Offender Engagement Programme was established to explore the nature of the one-to-one relationship between practitioners and offenders and its potential to change behaviour (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0264550512470188">Copsey, 2011</xref> for a summary of progress so far). Dr Sue Rex, Programme and Research Manager, contributed to two of the seminars and shared information about the Programme. New National Standards for the Management of Offenders were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0264550512470188">NOMS, 2011</xref>), with professional judgement being given far greater weight than previously. In a related field, Eileen Munro’s (2011) review of child protection provided an authoritative exploration of similar themes and some of her thinking informed the thinking underpinning the seminar series. </p>
<p>Managers and practitioners from probation and youth justice services across the Midlands were invited to the seminars. Under the series title of ‘Thinking in Practice’, keynote speakers presented knowledge and research evidence relating to one of the four seminar topics and at each seminar participants were given opportunities to explore ways in which the ideas presented could be used in both staff supervision and that of offenders. A theoretical understanding of professional development underpinned the seminar structure; it was hoped that as well as introducing new ideas, participants would be reminded of the role of critical thinking and reflection – that it is not a ‘luxury’ that can be dispensed with but a way of improving service design and delivery. There is a growing understanding of the importance of professional skills and knowledge to inform good decision-making, not least in the context of managing risk (Baker et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0264550512470188">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0264550512470188">Munro, 2011</xref>). A crucial element therefore was to review the inclusion of professional development and support in staff supervision, in addition to that of accountability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0264550512470188">
<title>Theories of learning and professional development</title>
<p>Professional development is an ongoing process of life-long learning in which individuals develop knowledge and skills relevant to their occupational role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0264550512470188">Eadie, 2007</xref>). Essential to this is a personal commitment and openness to learning, and being given (or taking) the opportunity to stand back from day-to-day practice and reflect on both the detail of individual practice and its wider context either within or outside of formal supervisory structures. Learning is an active process and Kolb’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0264550512470188">1984</xref>) Experiential Learning Cycle demonstrates its cyclical nature.</p>
<p>Kolb asserted that learning from experience is not automatic – people have to ‘process’ the experience for the learning to become effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0264550512470188">Thompson and Thompson, 2002</xref>: 4). This entails four stages – a concrete experience, some reflection on this in terms of its significance and meaning, the making of links to previous experiences to help make sense of the current one, and trying out the new insights which becomes another concrete experience and so the cycle continues – each time with a greater depth of understanding. It was Kolb’s contention that an individual had to move through each stage for learning to be completed. </p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0264550512470188">Morrison (1993</xref>), writing about staff supervision in social care, draws on Kolb’s work to develop the sense of supervision being a process for generating change and development, not solely for ensuring accountability and maintaining standards. He suggests that learning involves feeling, thinking and doing and takes place ‘when we are able to integrate experiencing, reflecting, conceptualising and active experimenting and can do this on a continuous basis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0264550512470188">Morrison, 1993</xref>: 46).</p>
<p>It can therefore be argued that learning from experience has to be worked on to be effective and that time and space for reflection is central to this. The concept of reflection and reflective practice as a key part of professional development is credited to Donald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0264550512470188">Schön (1991</xref>). His contention that human problems are too complex and ‘messy’ to be solved by technical solutions alone resonates with the ethos underpinning the seminar series: targets and standards can direct practitioners towards certain ways of working with offenders, but effective practice requires engaging with knowledge and shaping it in a creative way to fit individual circumstances, rather than expecting it to provide ready-made solutions. The seminar structure sought to draw on this, giving participants time to apply the knowledge input from speakers to issues arising in their own organisations. The shift towards the use of judgement in the new National Standards is also of relevance here, as is the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0264550512470188">Munro (2011</xref>) underlining the importance of professional expertise in decision making being drawn from experience which has been properly reflected upon, as well as from formal knowledge. Ways in which the seminar content and subsequent discussions linked to these theoretical understandings will now be discussed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0264550512470188">
<title>Thinking in practice: Avoiding the ‘rationality mistake’ and other errors</title>
<p>The four speakers invited to contribute to the first seminar, ‘Engaging with risk: Limitations and opportunities of risk assessment tools’, explored some of the issues surrounding the current dominance of such tools – notably Asset in Youth Justice and OASys in prisons and probation. Errors can occur between the development of centrally driven policy and its implementation in practice and reasons for why both offenders and practitioners do not always respond in the way that the ‘rational actor’ is expected to were explored, and the impact of this for how risk is managed was discussed. Referred to as the ‘rationality mistake’, those who develop risk tools and introduce risk policies often fail to understand the reality of the use of the tools in practice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0264550512470188">Baker, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264550512470188">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0264550512470188">Kemshall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0264550512470188">White et al., 2009</xref>). Organizations can increase monitoring and introduce other controls to achieve compliance with policy, but this will not take proper account of the practitioner experience, constraints on their decision-making, nor how they weigh up and act on information. </p>
<p>Participants fully engaged with these ideas and discussions in this and subsequent seminars reflected the way in which ‘doing what is expected’ was dominating practice rather than practitioners being encouraged to take responsibility for making professionally informed decisions. It was questioned whether focusing on getting the process right really makes a difference in outcomes for offenders. Instead, quality was seen as being about the ability to get alongside people and understand their perspectives, rather than producing ‘clone like people who do it by the book’. It was observed that the use of risk tools, particularly on screen, could hinder thinking processes – for example the order in which information is considered and the extent to which different components are linked together and seen in interaction with each other.</p>
<p>The rationality mistake applies not only to oversimplified understandings of practitioner responses to policy, but also to over-generalized understandings of how individual offenders might interpret and respond to service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0264550512470188">Kemshall, 2010</xref>). How offenders themselves perceive the world is important; for example, risks faced by young people are often understood differently by adults and young people. Practitioners therefore need to maintain a critical approach to understanding responses to risk, including seeking a better understanding of how service recipients articulate and rationalize their experiences, including their experiences of service delivery. A positive development relating to this was presented in a later seminar regarding attempts to take feedback from offenders and to use that feedback to make a difference to service design.</p>
<p>The question was raised of the nature of the evidence being drawn upon to inform practice, and the need to broaden its base to include practice literature as well as research studies. In relation to experience of conducting a literature review for the Youth Justice Board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0264550512470188">Prior and Mason, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0264550512470188">Youth Justice Board, 2008</xref>), it was suggested that only in this way would it fully reflect and inform the practice experience and allow for engagement with the ‘messy reality’ of work focused on individual change. There is little doubt that theory and research has made an important contribution in the last two decades; the Risk-Needs-Responsivity paradigm in particular (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264550512470188">Andrews and Bonta, 2003</xref>) and the related emphasis on evidence-based policy and practice has had a significant impact on service design and delivery, including the use of assessment tools. Arguably, however, there has been a failure by policy makers until very recently to critically reflect on the wider implications of these approaches. It was noted a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0264550512470188">Robinson, 2001</xref>) that the development of ‘what works’ was something of a mixed blessing as, whilst increasing the credibility of the service, it also increased the more technical and routine aspects of the work.</p>
<p>Participants identified with the orthodoxy of what works research and its clear and unequivocal messages for practice and acknowledged that the impact of this has been to distance practitioners from reflecting on theory and its implications for practice. The potential for encouraging defensive rather than defensible decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264550512470188">Kemshall, 1998</xref>) was recognized. Implications of this for the professional role and on the use of judgement was explored in subsequent seminars and some of the issues raised are explored in the following two sections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0264550512470188">
<title>Thinking in practice: Gaining and maintaining professional confidence</title>
<p>Both managers and practitioners talked about their perception that procedure and accountability rather than quality and depth of engagement was still, organizationally, centre stage. This was accompanied by a sense of reduced professional confidence – a theme threaded through presentations and discussions – not just in assessment, but also in the planning and delivery of interventions. Probation service officers in particular felt left to fend for themselves whilst being exposed to a wide range of offenders and offending behaviours. With few opportunities to co-work, be mentored, or be observed, they worried about their skills: ‘Am I doing it right?’; ‘Do I have the appropriate communication skills?’. It was further suggested that the routine use of standardized worksheets with offenders as a method of ‘evidencing’ that interventions had taken place pointed to a climate of defensiveness and inhibited individualised relationship building with offenders.</p>
<p>Managers also had concerns about the professional confidence of practitioners and the potential impact on quality of an over-emphasis on using tools combined with meeting targets. The challenge for them as managers was how to use their supervisory role to support the quality of practice. Ideas included having more conversations with practitioners about their use of judgment and making time to observe practice, focusing on quality of engagement. There are encouraging signs of developments in this area; the offender engagement programme is, at the time of writing, piloting a programme of training in reflective supervision as a means of developing the manager’s role in the supervision of practice. Further, an approach to practice is being developed that emphasizes making the best use of theory and research, evidencing skills in one-to-one work, and using observation by others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0264550512470188">Wilkinson and Kelly, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The lack of professional confidence reflected in some of the discussions also linked to a sense of there being little or no time for reflection on quality in practice. An overemphasis on control and accountability has been found to lead to bureaucracy and to divert attention from client contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0264550512470188">Kemshall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0264550512470188">Munro, 2011</xref>). Participants acknowledged that a session might be brought to an early close due to the amount of administrative work that the officer knew had to be completed that day. It was further suggested that offenders know officers are under time pressures and so collude by saying everything is alright, enabling officers to get back to the paperwork. This, rather than direct work with offenders, then becomes their focus, a point also made by the Select Committee Report on the role of the probation service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0264550512470188">House of Commons, 2011</xref>). Whilst work at different tiers requires different amounts of face-to-face contact, it was nevertheless clear that participants lacked confidence in their ability to undertake what they regarded as quality work within the time available to them. </p>
<p>The ability to respond with confidence and sensitivity to the emotional experience of offenders is central to supporting change and agency but is hampered if a practitioner’s own emotional response is given little credence, and if the sort of professional reflection that would help workers make sense of their interactions with offenders is missing from supervision. This is another example of the ‘rationality mistake’ in which organizations fail to understand the complexity of responses to policy and how this can hamper successful implementation. It could also be suggested that a ‘blame culture’ in relation to risk might increase emotional disengagement, thereby further reducing the ability of professionals to be properly responsive to those with whom they work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264550512470188">Carson and Bain, 2008</xref>). </p>
<p>Linked to the above and drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264550512470188">Goleman (1995</xref>) and the speaker’s own research (see Knight, 2012), the importance of emotional literacy in work with offenders was explored and applied to staff supervision. Whilst participants offered some examples of managers who were open to discussing feelings (regarded as useful) there was general agreement that the probation service is more concerned with target driven outcomes. In a culture that regards the displaying of emotions as weakness, any serious attempt to develop greater emotional literacy, whilst something to be applauded, might not be welcomed; current workload pressures could mean that anything that increased the need to address more complexity would be construed as a threat – in relation to both the supervision of offenders and staff. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0264550512470188">
<title>Thinking in practice: The importance of professional judgement</title>
<p>Using the metaphor of a ‘sat-nav’, practitioners in a target driven climate may see assessment tools as a way of getting to their destination (for example, risk classifications and intervention plans), but may not fully understand how they arrived there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0264550512470188">Baker and Wilkinson, 2011</xref>). If this is contrasted with seeing the tools as a map instead – which provides guidance and a sense of direction but allows space for individual choice and judgment – the dangers of an overly prescriptive and technical approach to the tools becomes clear. Practitioners need help to see assessment tools more broadly, as a means of developing knowledge about the individual in context, rather than just as a way of finding the ‘right’ answer. This is likely to require a greater focus on the quality of understanding and analysis, and perhaps also of the role of narrative in understanding offending behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0264550512470188">Craissati and Sindall 2009</xref>), in addition to increased use of judgement in professional decision-making.</p>
<p>Professional judgement should draw on rational processes such as information gathered by risk assessment tools but also needs to be informed by intuitive judgements based on practice, experience and wisdom. Both types of decision-making, rational and intuitive, are important to professional practice and not having time for reflection, or just using a tick-box formula to review action, is likely to impact negatively on overall effectiveness. Decision-making in supervisory work with offenders takes place within the context of both a helping and social control role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0264550512470188">Trotter, 2006</xref>). The balancing of care and control has always been the hallmark of work with offenders (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264550512470188">Barry, 2000</xref>) but the target-driven climate of the last two decades coupled with the political imperative to be ‘tough on crime’ has resulted in the balance moving away from helping and towards controlling, and, since the introduction of National Standards, from judgement to prescribed practice. </p>
<p>Practitioners and managers have to make judgements; no law, theory, policy, or procedure can prescribe a response to every situation. There will always be an amount of ambiguity or difference which requires a flexible and individualized response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0264550512470188">Eadie and Canton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0264550512470188">Gelsthorpe and Padfield, 2003</xref>). Standards, rules, policies and procedures that are too rigid will constrain a practitioner or manager’s authority to make a professional judgement about what (or what not) to do in any given situation. Conversely unbounded discretion can result in discriminatory or unfair practice. It has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0264550512470188">Eadie and Canton, 2002</xref>) that <italic>best</italic> practice results from both high accountability and wide (though not unbounded) discretion as opposed to the constrained practice of high accountability and narrow discretion where, in reality, managers and front line staff have found themselves in recent years.</p>
<p>This tricky balance was explored through a presentation about the nature of compliance – specifically how to support what was termed substantive, not just formal compliance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0264550512470188">Bottoms, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0264550512470188">Robinson and McNeill, 2008</xref>). Reasons for an individual’s compliance with a community penalty will vary but substantive compliance is most important when the quality of engagement is likely to be significant in achieving outcomes. Substantive compliance is likely to be gained by workers who can exercise evidenced and clearly explained professional discretion within a clear context of accountability. </p>
<p>There was disparity amongst participants as to how much discretion they felt they had and the extent to which they felt <italic>able</italic> to divert from the ‘script’ and deliver requirements in ways which might motivate and engage offenders more effectively. In the light of this, the new National Standards are likely to provide both opportunities and threats – the former for those currently exercising discretion, and the latter for those who feel that enthusiasm for the shift towards a more professionally responsive service is not shared throughout the organization. Discussions about the use of judgement highlighted a general lack of consistency regarding practices and styles of engagement. These seemed to be driven by the ethos and values of key senior practitioners and/or managers but where practitioners felt empowered to use their professional judgement, their experience of supervision seemed to be generally more positive. Within these more supportive work environments, engagement and motivational work was equated with effective risk management, but this was clearly not a universally held belief across organisations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0264550512470188">
<title>Thinking in practice: Discussion</title>
<p>Despite all of the concerns that were being raised and some of the negative experiences shared in the seminars there was without doubt some cautious optimism. Individuals were able to share developments in practice that felt positive, for example working with a voluntary resettlement scheme, and undertaking ‘Stepping Stones’ training which supports a more active approach to engaging offenders in goal setting. There was also optimism about developments from the Centre, notably the Offender Engagement Programme and the reflective supervision pilot and, by the last seminar, the new National Standards. </p>
<p>Further optimism was generated as participants worked with the implications of a developing knowledge base. There was an enthusiastic response to theory and research on desistance introduced by Fergus McNeill and returned to by Mark Farmer in the specific context of work with sex offenders. How offenders begin and sustain desistance from crime and what role criminal justice interventions may play in that contains within it many ideas for the positive development of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0264550512470188">McNeill, 2009</xref>). Time did not allow for in-depth discussions of developments such as the Good Lives Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0264550512470188">Ward, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0264550512470188">Ward and Maruna, 2007</xref>) and how understandings of desistance can complement the Risk-Needs-Responsivity model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0264550512470188">McNeill and Weaver, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0264550512470188">Maruna, 2010</xref>), but elements of these understandings found real resonance with those who attended. </p>
<p>Of particular interest to participants was a reference to a paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0264550512470188">Maruna and Mann (2006</xref>) concerning sex offenders which questioned ways in which denial is usually understood and responded to. Practice has tended to focus on challenging individual offenders to take responsibility and to avoid making excuses for their offending behaviour but more recent thinking suggests a potential danger of challenging psychological processes that can be useful to the individual – for the very reason that they are creating distance from a harmful act that they have come to appreciate is negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0264550512470188">Yates, 2009</xref>). There is therefore a need to distinguish between pro-offending beliefs that make further offending more likely and rationalizations post offence, which may actually help an offender distance themselves from their involvement in socially unacceptable behaviour. This was a novel idea and one worth emphasizing. What might be more useful for some offenders is to be helped to accept future oriented responsibility, that is to internalize responsibility for overcoming difficulties and changing their behaviour. This presents a challenge to some of the complex detail of service delivery, including the risk management of some high-risk offenders. There was a positive response to this different approach to understanding denial, although there was also a degree of concern reflecting the earlier point about how ready practitioners are to take on greater professional responsibility and how supported they feel in this.</p>
<p>Other examples of elements that engaged and energized participants included:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>A renewed emphasis on helping ex-offenders move towards better lives;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A focus on the importance of supervision as an active process in which individual offenders discover and exercise agency in seeking a better future;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The importance of developing both human and social capital, specifically capacities and skills, and opportunities respectively; </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Change supported by someone ‘believing in’ the offender, and the belief that the ‘someone’ can be the offender manager;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The Good Lives Model and support for a strengths based approach to service delivery;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A critique of the Coalition Green Paper ‘Breaking the Cycle’ which had been published only two days before the final seminar.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Practitioners were also energized by the sense of there being more than one way of working with the diverse range of people whom they supervised. As has been discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0264550512470188">Eadie and Canton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0264550512470188">Munro, 2011</xref>), over-standardized practice cannot provide a sufficient range of responses to address the variety of need. In order, therefore, to reinforce the importance of individual experience and complex understandings some specific attention to the diversity of offender experience was included in the series. This involved both focusing on a group defined by their offending behaviour (i.e. issues discussed in relation to sex offenders above), and working with women, specifically women at the Asha Women’s Centre (ashcentre@btconnect.com). The importance of understanding the specific experiences of women and delivering services in the light of this was stressed, and also of supporting women in exercising choice, a theme that reinforced understandings of desistance, the exercise of agency, and strengths based approaches. </p>
<p>The focus of the seminars had from the outset been rooted in the steering group’s sense of the importance of the one-to-one relationship. This was reinforced by research findings about desistance, by the input on compliance, and the importance of consistency in work with offenders. The discussion of the Asha Women’s Centre therefore presented an interesting challenge as the Centre does not emphasize the traditional ‘case work’ relationship, providing instead a holistic environment in which women can be supported to make changes. This reinforced the significance of the whole organization being set up to understand the complex problems that individuals face, and the importance of individual change and agency. It is of course different delivering services in a statutory context with responsibilities for court orders, but the challenge to the centrality of the casework relationship was food for thought. At the very least we were reminded that as we take on new understandings we need to keep actively reflecting on their real impact on practice and on outcomes, remaining willing to change practice and service design in response to evaluations and experience in service delivery.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>One of the things that was evident throughout the seminar series was the commitment of practitioners and managers who attended to stick with the changing organizations and give the best possible service to offenders and society. The mood was far from pessimistic and there was a genuine willingness to explore different ways of delivering services. This was helped by optimism regarding the forthcoming changes to National Standards which participants felt would give them more freedom to use their professional judgement, and by other developments such as the NOMS Offender Engagement Programme. </p>
<p>All of the organisers were and continue to be committed to the belief that an effective practitioner is a reflective practitioner and in the development of this seminar series they set themselves the task of providing a ‘reflective space’ for busy practitioners and managers. The aim of this was to provide an opportunity for each participant to step back from day-to-day pressures and hear about new knowledge, research findings, and wider developments that could shape future practice. It was also to offer space to reflect on their own work, whether supervising staff or offenders, and recognize how theory can contribute towards better practice understandings, particularly in the measurement of quality as well as quantity.</p>
<p>During a period of two years, the period over which the seminars took place, it was inevitable that change would take place but the reality – a worsening financial situation and a change of government – are leading to changes that are greater than any of us could have anticipated. In some ways, however, the aims of the seminar series prefigured some of changes which have the potential to encourage reflective practice, namely the Offender Engagement Programme and the new National Standards. The House of Commons Justice Select Committee Report into the Role of the Probation Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0264550512470188">House of Commons, 2011</xref>) stated that Probation Staff spend only 25 per cent of their time in face-to-face encounters with offenders, a percentage that resonated with some of the participants. If the new National Standards are implemented as suggested in the Practice Framework this will have to change and offender managers will be required to spend more time engaging in purposeful relationships with offenders. This and the requirement to make more independent professional judgements further demonstrate a need to underpin this with reflection and a solid knowledge base.</p>
<p>As a series of linked but separate seminars conducted over a period of time, the seminars themselves and the speakers adapted to the changing wider context, thus demonstrating that theory and research in this field is constantly evolving. The participants’ contribution was all the more valuable because it was grounded in practice. At the final seminar they were keen to discuss the forthcoming changes, some of which were likely to challenge fundamental thinking about work with offenders, whilst also engaging with more philosophical questions about the role of the public sector in criminal justice work and being open to new and radical ideas. Whilst it is not possible to assess the long-term impact of the seminars on participants specifically, and their colleagues more generally, at the very least the series provoked some thoughtful and critical debate and also enabled speakers to hear practitioner and manager perspectives. Feedback from participants suggests that exposure to a range of theoretical challenges to taken-for-granted practice is much valued, as is the re-emphasis on the quality of engagement with individual offenders.</p>
