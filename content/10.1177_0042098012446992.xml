<abstract>
<p>Housing tenure sits at the heart of much academic and policy literature across many post-industrial countries, and, while debate is often centred on promoting tenure choice, surprisingly little is known of the underlying ways that the tenure chosen can affect health. While population characteristics tend to vary between tenure types, this largely reflects the forces of broader social and economic selection into those tenures. This paper examines what identifiable effect tenure has upon the mental health of individuals, over and above the characteristics of selection. The analysis is based upon 40 828 responses of 10 245 individuals in the Australian working-age population who participated in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia study between 2001 and 2007. It is found that, while mental health varies significantly between tenure types, once tenure population differences are accounted for there is little evidence of an intrinsic relationship between tenure and mental health.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Housing and health are central human themes that affect our populations and shape our cities. In the Australian context, problems around housing and health are dominantly, because of our settlement pattern, urban problems. Almost 70 per cent of Australians live in major cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012446992">ABS, 2012</xref>), and housing policies are principally focused upon these capital cities. Housing tenure is at the heart of much academic and policy literature across many post-industrial countries and, while substantial debate is centred on promoting tenure choice, surprisingly little is known of the underlying ways that the tenure chosen can affect health. This paper examines the influence of housing tenure on mental health. It contributes important evidence on the somewhat subtle relationship between housing and mental health, evidence that potentially could be used to promote housing choices that also promote health.</p>
<p>Housing and health are closely linked within the complex causal pathways that define our lives. The influence of housing on the health of populations and individuals is well established in the literature (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012446992">Shaw, 2004</xref>; p. 402; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098012446992">Jacobs, 2004</xref>, p. 35). However, although housing’s position as a determinant of health is a broadly acknowledged premise, quantifiable evidence is limited. The evidence base is restricted in three key areas—insufficient evidence on the health effects of the non-shelter elements of housing, residual confounding (both within and between populations), and insufficient evidence that is robust and causally focused. Each will be discussed.</p>
<p>The existing evidence base exhibits a notable dominance of research focusing on physical housing features (shelter elements)—for example, warm, dry houses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012446992">Bonnefoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012446992">Shaw, 2004</xref>), overcrowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098012446992">Howden-Chapman and Wilson, 2000</xref>) and the presence of toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098012446992">Jacobs, 2004</xref>), all of which have been associated with health effects. A much smaller proportion of the evidence base establishes relationships between non-shelter housing elements and health—for example, affordability problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098012446992">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098012446992">Shaw <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012446992">Ford and Burrows, 1999</xref>), neighbourhood and place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012446992">Acevedo-Garcia <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), incidence of local crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098012446992">Ross and Mirowsky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098012446992">Stafford <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), and housing tenure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098012446992">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012446992">Macintyre <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The population of people who are renting either privately or publicly has, on average, many characteristics which distinguish renters from homeowners. Socioeconomic position plays a large role in the sorting of people into tenure types, as does age (for example, older people are more likely to be homeowners). Therefore, to look at the association between tenure and health we would need to control for the sorts of population characteristics that confound, or are alternative explanations for, this association. This is most often done by adjusting models for characteristics of individuals who are likely to be associated with the measure of tenure type and the health outcome of interest. So the extent of adjusting for this confounding is likely to be as good as the quality of the information to which we have access, which also highlights issues around measurement error and unexplained variation. The reality is that most associations between tenure and health would be subject to residual confounding even after adjustment for a range of characteristics including age, socioeconomic position and socio-demographic characteristics.</p>
<p>Similarly, few studies have employed analytical approaches or methodological designs that have provided evidence beyond association. While establishing that association is important within any evidence base, establishing causation—although much more difficult—provides ‘gold standard’ evidence, on which policy and interventions can be more confidently based. The difficulty of providing causal evidence has been highlighted as a research limitation, in recent reviews of health and housing research. In answer to this limitation, a number of recent studies and reviews (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012446992">Clark <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098012446992">Thomson, Petticrew and Morrison, 2001</xref>) have highlighted the potential of longitudinal studies to explore the relationship between housing and health, a relationship that cannot be adequately understood using cross-sectional studies alone. Importantly, longitudinal studies are able to address a key limitation of cross-sectional studies—the direction of effect (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012446992">Mair <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012446992">Acevedo-Garcia <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>, p. 54; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098012446992">Hopton and Hunt, 1996</xref>, p. 274; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042098012446992">Wells and Harris, 2007</xref>, p. 71; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012446992">Shaw, 2004</xref>, p. 411).</p>
<p>This paper describes the analysis and findings of research that contributes to the housing and health evidence base and addresses the three areas of limitation already discussed. We examine the mental health effect of one of the key non-shelter housing influences over health—housing tenure—using random and fixed effects longitudinal regression analysis. In the random effects model, we simultaneously compare individuals with each other, as well as examine differences within individuals over time. In the fixed effects model, we make comparisons within individuals only, over time, thereby removing bias associated with differences between people in the population that are not measured or that are hard to measure (such as childhood socioeconomic position). Our methodology is applied to an analytical sample of 10 245 individuals (40 828 observations), within which an analytical sub-sample of 3815 changed their residence (on 5773 occasions) during the study period. We examine change in self-assessed mental health that occurs subsequent to tenure change. We additionally follow individuals over time, as they change or remain in tenures, and examine health changes that result from specific types of housing change (renter to owner; owner to renter; no change).</p>

<title>2. Housing Tenure and Health</title>
<p>Tenure is widely recognised as an upstream determinant of health, but importantly for measurement the pathway is likely to be indirect, bidirectional and “difficult to isolate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012446992">Acevedo-Garcia <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>, p. 54). Several international studies have, however, found a relationship between tenure and health outcomes (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012446992">Howden-Chapman <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012446992">Hiscock <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098012446992">Macintyre <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042098012446992">Windle <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012446992">Costa-Font, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012446992">Filakti and Fox, 1995</xref>). In the majority of studies examining the health outcomes of tenure, owner-occupation is found to be the ‘healthiest’ tenure type (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098012446992">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>, p. 579; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098012446992">Macintyre <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>, p. 129; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012446992">Macintyre <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), associated with “a variety of health benefits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012446992">Cairney and Boyle, 2004</xref>, p. 161), from greater psychosocial wellbeing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012446992">Kearns <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>), to lower risk ratios for mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012446992">Breeze <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). The generally better overall condition of privately owned and mortgaged dwellings and the preferable living conditions homeowners enjoy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098012446992">Macintyre <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>) may partly explain the better health of owner-occupiers compared with other housing tenures. Owned homes generally have fewer problems of overcrowding and damp, or exposure to incidents of crime or anti-social behaviour from neighbours (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012446992">Macintyre <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Correspondingly, rental tenure, and especially public rental, is most often associated with various negative health measures, such as poorer self-reported health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042098012446992">Windle <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), coronary heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098012446992">Woodward <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>) and risky health behaviours such as smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098012446992">Kendig <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Across these studies, there is evidence that the health outcomes measured are, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012446992">Hiscock <italic>et al</italic>. (2003)</xref>, likely to be the result of both the characteristics of residents (compositional) <italic>and</italic> the characteristics of their residences (causal). Evidence of both causal and compositional health effects have been found across the literature.</p>
<p>Pathways, or mechanisms, by which tenure might causally influence health, have been indicated in a few recent studies and five main pathways (around prestige, burden of debt, affordability, residential instability and housing condition) tend to dominate this literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012446992">Gibson <italic>et al</italic>.’s (2011)</xref> comprehensive synthesis of previous systematic reviews highlights the importance of tenure/health pathways. In this paper, they suggest that tenure may act to influence mental health through the relative prestige conferred by an individual’s tenure. This mental health effect of prestige was also suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012446992">Hiscock <italic>et al</italic>. (2003)</xref> who found that homeowners perceived greater “protection, autonomy, and prestige” from their tenure (p. 536). While homeowners are likely to experience a prestige-related mental health benefit from their tenure, a number of other studies have highlighted the negative mental health effects attributed to the “burden of debt” (p. 178) felt by many homeowners (and some renters). In this vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098012446992">Smith <italic>et al</italic>. (2003)</xref> found that homeownership can be health-limiting for individuals with existing illnesses, poor health or whose “resilience is low” (p. 501). In many such cases, the costs of maintaining housing or mortgage payments can be a burden, or the quality of housing that can be afforded on reduced incomes may not be health promoting. A number of further studies have highlighted the importance of the financial strain as influencing the tenure/health pathway. Housing affordability is a well-documented determinant of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012446992">Bentley, Baker and Mason, 2011</xref>) affecting individuals through stress and anxiety. Importantly for this examination of tenure, recent research has also highlighted that the effect of poor housing affordability appears to be further compounded by tenure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098012446992">Pollack <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). In their study, the authors found that renting a home increased the association between poor housing affordability and lower self-rated health. Finally, not only are negative health effects of tenure related to the patterns of stress and anxiety of unaffordability across tenure types, but the relatively insecure nature of the rental system (often with set lease terms) may also influence health indirectly through the regular fracturing of social assistance networks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012446992">Cutts <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)</xref>, for example, found a clear association between children who lived in insecure housing who had made multiple moves and poor health and developmental risk.</p>
<p>While numerous studies have found direct associations between tenure and health, a number of studies have found that the strength of these relationships may be limited or weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012446992">Clark <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) reflecting the compositional bias of populations in tenures rather than a causal effect of each tenure type. The systematic review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012446992">Clark <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> points to ‘equivocal’ findings in many studies that explore the relationship between mental health and tenure. They suggest that some of the explanation for this is the methodological problem of separating tenure from the confounding influence of broader social disadvantage (p. 22). The relationship between tenure and health is also confounded by compositional selection bias. Healthier and wealthier individuals are able to choose to live in owner-occupied housing; those with fewer resources or with more constraints (such as physical disability, unemployment or poverty) are more likely to reside in the rental sector. This selection difference is further concentrated by social policies that attempt to address disadvantage by favouring those with existing health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098012446992">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>) and socioeconomic disadvantage in the public/social housing system. Such ‘cumulative’ disadvantage where lower-income households can be allocated public/social housing in less desirable parts of our cities is well described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098012446992">Saegert and Evans (2003)</xref>. It also needs to be noted that, in addition to the difficulty of isolating the clear causal links between tenure and health, the relationship is also significantly context-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012446992">Shaw, 2003</xref>). While this is true for the broader health and housing relationship, it is especially relevant when considering tenure because of the additional contextual layer provided by jurisdictional housing policies and their ideological bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098012446992">Kemeny, 2001</xref>). In countries such as Australia, with a dual housing system (Kullberg, 2002), where social housing is regarded as a ‘safety-net’ and access is based upon need, there is likely to be a higher selection bias for ill-health within this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012446992">Baker, 2008</xref>). In unitary housing systems, like that of Sweden, where the socially rented system is not specifically aimed at the lower-income population, there is likely to be less selection bias for ill-health and a weaker relationship between housing tenure and health (as was found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012446992">Hartig and Fransson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This research explores the mental health effect of tenure. Acknowledging that the population characteristics within each tenure vary within Australia, we hypothesise that over and above these cohort differences there will be a measurable mental health effect attributable to tenure. We focus our analysis around two questions to test our hypothesis systematically. These questions seek first to establish if there is a relationship between tenure type and mental health for this Australian study population (Q1) and, secondly, to establish the degree to which any measured health effect is <italic>caused</italic> by tenure or reflects the <italic>composition</italic> of tenure populations (Q2)</p>

<title>3. Method and Approach</title>
<p>We analyse data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) longitudinal study. This large Australian dataset has followed households, and the individuals that have remained in, entered or left these households across a number of annual data collection waves. Households were selected for the HILDA study using a multistaged approach: 488 census collection districts across Australia were selected; within each of these areas 22–34 dwellings were selected; within each dwelling up to three households<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098012446992">1</xref></sup> were selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0042098012446992">Watson, 2008</xref>). The survey collects social and economic information from individuals and their households using a combination of face-to-face interviews with trained interviewers and a self-completion questionnaire at each annual wave. Interviews are sought from every member of the household aged 15 years and over.</p>
<p>The analysis described in this paper is based upon two analytical samples. In the first component of the analysis, where we examine the relationship between tenure type and mental health, we use the 40 828 responses of 10 245 Australians aged 25–64 who participated in the HILDA study between 2001 (wave 1) and 2007 (wave 7). In the second component of the analysis, in which we focus on change in mental health associated with change in tenure, we restrict our analysis to movers. Movers are defined as individuals who moved house between any two consecutive annual waves of the survey. A person was classified as having moved between waves of HILDA if they were recorded as having moved more than a kilometre since the last survey was undertaken or, if distance moved was less than a kilometre, they were recorded as having moved if a change of address was recorded. The indicator of movement was therefore not based on respondent reporting, but on address information so that we avoided bias associated with respondents recalling the timing of their last move. As some people moved more than once in the course of the survey, we estimated models based on the first move only and compared findings with models estimated across all moves to see if multiple movers were amplifying the results. Given that the results were not substantively different, we have presented findings for models that include multiple movers. Related to this, while we assess in this analysis changes in mental health that occur between annual waves of the HILDA data, it is possible that we do not capture longer-term mental health effects.</p>
<p>There were 8501 residential moves recorded in the HILDA dataset between waves 1 and 7 for people aged 25–64. Due to missing data available for covariates, we restricted our analysis to 5773 moving events of 3815 movers in the HILDA dataset. This represented 68 per cent of all moving events recorded in the HILDA dataset.</p>
<sec id="section4-0042098012446992">
<title>3.1 The Outcome Variables</title>
<p>The Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the Short Form 36 measure (SF-36) was used as the outcome measure for these analyses. The SF-36 is one of the most widely used self-completion measures of health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012446992">Coons <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>) and it has been validated for the detection of changes in health over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012446992">Hemingway <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>) and for use within the Australian population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012446992">McCallum, 1995</xref>). Other studies have found the SF-36 to be responsive to changes in a variety of household circumstances, such as housing affordability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012446992">Bentley <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) and divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012446992">Hewitt and Turrell, 2011</xref>). The SF-36 consists of 36 items measuring various dimensions of health, from which eight sub-scales are generated. The MCS is a summary measure that relates most directly to four of these sub-scales: vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems (role-emotional) and mental health. These elements of the SF-36 are determined by asking participants how often in the past four weeks they have felt, for example, “full of life”, “worn out” or “down in the dumps”, the extent to which physical or emotional problems interfered with social activities, and the impact of emotional problems on work or other daily activities, among other questions. A higher score on the 0–100 MCS scale reflects better mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<title>3.2 The Predictor Variables</title>
<p>Mental health is considered in relation to two different measures of tenure. The first is tenure type (owner; private renter; public renter), reflecting Australia’s three dominant tenures. The second, change in tenure (no change; owner to renter; renter to owner) looks at transitions between the major tenure types. A small proportion of observations where tenure was not defined within these categories (4 per cent) were not reported in this analysis. Each of these predictor variables is tested in separate models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0042098012446992">
<title>3.3 The Analysis</title>
<p>We calculated the mean and standard deviation for mental health by tenure type, age, sex, income, etc. adjusting for the clustering of observations within people over time. We then compared tenure by population characteristics for the most recently available year of data (2007). Longitudinal regression models of the association between tenure type and mental health were estimated in Stata 11.0, with random effects estimators and fixed effects estimators. The random effects models estimate both within- and between-person differences in mental health over time, according to tenure type. The fixed effects models, on the other hand, estimate health changes over time within individuals only, meaning the analysis is not biased by confounding caused by the composition of people within each tenure type. Models were adjusted in the first instance for age (centred on the mean), sex and survey year (model 1), then we made further adjustment for equivalised household income (based on OECD equivalence scales; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098012446992">OECD, 2009</xref>), education, occupation and housing affordability stress (low-income households paying more than 30 per cent of income on rent/mortgage) and residential moves between waves (model 2). Fixed effects models were not adjusted for sex, as these models estimate within-person change only (and sex is, in this dataset, constant over time). While the random effects models control for various potential compositional factors, there remains the possibility that unmeasured heterogeneity in the composition of the tenure types explains health differences across the groups. Thus, comparison of the random and fixed effects models provides an indication of whether any association between tenure type and mental health was largely compositional or causal. In the analysis restricted to movers, we used a longitudinal fixed effects regression approach to estimate the changes in mental health attributable to <italic>changes</italic> in tenure type (comparing no tenure change with both ownership-to-rental and rental-to-ownership). Because the number of public renters in the dataset who had also moved was small, we collapsed both rental types (private and public rental) into one category for this analysis.</p>

<title>4. Descriptive Findings</title>
<p>The mean MCS score was 46.9 with a standard deviation of 10.7 (range: 3.4 to 69.5). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098012446992">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive findings of mean mental health scores across the study population. Generally males had slightly higher mental health scores than females. Unsurprisingly, mean scores were positively related to age, with older age cohorts having higher average mental health scores. Households headed by professionals and white-collar workers had higher mean mental health than those headed by blue-collar workers. Across all cohorts, there was an increase in the average mental health score with increasing quintile of income (p&lt;0.001). Finally, individuals who moved house had slightly lower average mental health scores (47.3) than those who did not move (49.0).</p>

<p>Obvious differences in average mental health scores are evident across the three tenure types, homeowners having on average the highest mental health scores (49.4), followed by private renters (46.7) and then public renters. The quite low average mental health score for public renters (44.0) is unsurprising and reflects average mental health scores across other characteristics common to this population, such as low income, low-level education and unemployment—all of which are associated with lower average mental health scores. This lower average score also reflects the welfare focus of public housing in Australia, which prioritises the allocation of public housing to individuals and households that have existing disadvantage, illness or disability. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012446992">Table 2</xref> highlights differences in the population characteristics of each tenure group. Considering the age distribution, there is a clear age gradient for private renters, with more than 40 per cent aged less than 35 years. This is generally the inverse of the age distribution pattern for homeowners and public renters, who tend to be in the older cohorts. Although in the homeownership and private rental cohorts there was a roughly even distribution of men and women, this was not the case for public renters, who were predominantly female (63.3 per cent). The stark differences in income distribution by tenure type are highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098012446992">Figure 1</xref>. Here, public renters are confirmed as concentrated in the lowest quintile of the income distribution, whereas the income distribution for private renters tends to be more even, and for homeowners there is a gradient, in which the highest income quintile dominates.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012446992">Table 2</xref> also shows that the educational attainment of homeowners and private renters is similar, but that public renters have low levels of attainment. The occupational profiles mirror those of educational attainment. Here, almost 50 per cent of homeowners are employed in professional occupations, compared with just below 12 per cent of public tenants. Correspondingly, more than 40 per cent of public tenants were unemployed or not in the labour force. Finally, the mobility rates also varied by tenure type; the highest mobility was seen among private tenants (34 per cent had moved in the previous year), compared with just 9 per cent of homeowners.</p>

<title>5. Key Findings from the Longitudinal Models</title>
<p>The first analytical model reported here uses longitudinal regression to address our first research question, which asks whether there is an association in the data between tenure type and mental health. This model makes comparison over time and between people to measure the association between tenure and mental health. The reported regression coefficients represent the mean difference in MCS score between tenure types, combining both within-person changes over time and between-person differences. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098012446992">Table 3</xref>, the model suggests a clear difference in average mental health scores between tenures after adjusting for various potential confounding variables. Compared with the reference group of homeowners, public housing tenants are shown to have the worst mental health scores, followed by those from other rental types, and then private renters. Importantly, while this model gives us an estimate of the association between tenure type and mental health, adjusted for measured potential confounders, it does not completely control for between-person variability so we cannot know from this analysis the extent to which the composition of people in each tenure type is confounding the association.</p>

<p>Further to interrogate the causal or compositional question, we then restricted our analytical sample to those who had moved house, comparing mental health outcomes for those who changed tenure with mental health outcomes for those whose tenure was unchanged. When we examined people who changed tenure, and looked at resultant changes in mental health, we found no statistical evidence that moving between tenure types was associated with change in mental health (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0042098012446992">Table 5</xref>). When we examined this separately for owners and renters, there was also no evidence of an association (not shown). It should be noted that, while our primary assumption is that tenure change drives mental health change, this is only measured annually in the longitudinal dataset and so may have occurred at any time within the year.</p>

<title>6. Discussion</title>
<p>Our housing systems and the tenures that form them are key pillars supporting our cities, economies and welfare systems. Importantly, the housing that we provide is a key determinant of the health of individual citizens. This paper has examined how one principal element of housing—tenure—can affect the mental health of individuals. We hypothesised that, over and above cohort differences across the population, there would be a measureable mental health effect attributable to tenure. While populations in different tenures were clearly found to have different average mental health, by comparing fixed effects (within-person) with random effects (between- and within-person) regression models, we found that poorer mental health among renters was more a reflection of the composition of the population than an effect of being in that tenure. Our two component research questions are answered as follows.</p>
<p>First, is tenure associated with mental health? Our findings clearly show an association between tenure and mental health, and this finding supports the findings of much previous research. We found that homeowners were the tenure type with the highest mental health scores, followed by private renters. Public renters were the group characterised by the lowest average scores. Further, the descriptive findings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012446992">Table 2</xref>) suggest that some explanation for the tenure differences in mental health scores is attributable to the cohort characteristics of individuals living in each tenure group.</p>
<p>Our second research question then tested the extent to which the association between tenure and mental health can be attributable to causal or compositional explanations. We tested both between-person and within-person variability over time to establish the extent to which observed associations between tenure and mental health could be explained by the characteristics of people in each tenure type. Our analysis indicated that the composition of the cohorts selected into each tenure type appears largely to explain much of the difference detected in average mental health scores. In further testing this research question, we examined if change in tenure was associated with change in mental health. This analysis was designed to test if, on average, the mental health of individuals changed if they changed tenure, to resemble more closely average mental health within their new tenure—that is, if there was some intrinsic effect of tenure on mental health. We therefore limited our analysis to individuals within the analytical dataset who had made a residential move during the study period. Importantly, we found no significant evidence of resultant changes to mental health scores when individuals moved and changed their tenure. We combined private and public renters into a single group for this analysis, due to small numbers, and while we recognise that this may have resulted in a more heterogeneous group of renters, a sensitivity analysis found that it did not influence our findings (results not shown).</p>
<p>This study has several important strengths and some limitations. This is a multidisciplinary study, benefiting from the methods and concepts of both social epidemiology and housing research. Using these tools systematically to isolate and measure a mental health effect of tenure, it is one of the first studies of its type using a large and robust national longitudinal dataset. Our findings challenge a commonly held assumption, that housing tenure has an effect on mental health, and this finding will be relevant to both researchers and policy-makers, especially those seeking to design housing solutions for vulnerable households.</p>
<p>The research is based upon secondary data and therefore contains some limitations. In terms of measuring tenure change, in a small number of cases an individual may have moved more than once between the survey waves, whereas the analytical dataset measures the housing and health characteristics at time 1 and time 2 only. Information was not available on the number of times between waves that survey participants had moved. Additionally, the timing of the move between the wave and the measurement of the outcome variable inevitably varies from case to case, and this is likely to bias our estimates downwardly. Based on our previous findings around mental health effects from housing affordability changes (Bentley <italic>et al</italic>., forthcoming), we anticipate that the mental health effect of changes in other housing characteristics (such as tenure) will be most evident in the first year.</p>
<p>The differences observed between tenure types in the random effects models may appear small in magnitude; however, even small differences in population means can equate to substantial numbers of individuals at risk, resulting in important public health and policy impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098012446992">Rose, 1993</xref>). Furthermore, the size of the measured differences should be viewed in light of the possibility that adjusting our models for affordability stress may have resulted in overadjustment (thus biasing our results to the null) if housing affordability also acts as a mediator of the association between tenure and mental health.</p>

<title>7. Conclusions</title>
<p>Our analysis of a large Australian dataset found no evidence of an intrinsic mental health effect of tenure and, although clear differences were seen in average mental health status across the three tenure groups, the analysis has shown these differences to be attributed principally to cohort composition. The finding, while unsurprising to some researchers, underlines the complexity of the housing and health relationship and questions the premises underlying some housing policies which assume an intrinsic effect of tenure. Importantly, these results only report on the mental health effects of tenure and we note that tenure may have other intrinsic benefits, such as financial, educational or ontological, and this is highlighted in our earlier work which finds that housing affordability is causally related to mental health outcomes. The characteristics of the housing that individuals both choose and obtain (such as its affordability, location, tenure, condition) interact in different ways with our physical and mental health.</p>
<p>While homeownership is widely regarded as the healthiest tenure, in the Australian context at least, this appears to be a description of the population selected, rather than an effect of the housing tenure itself. If tenure itself does not have a strong causal role in mental health, then this more clearly opens the door to the provision of alternative tenures to meet the housing needs of the population. Much research and policy work is built upon the premise that some housing tenures (such as homeownership) cause better outcomes for disadvantaged households. A clear example is the provision of homeownership assistance used in Australia to help low-income households—who would otherwise be unable to enter homeownership—into the housing market. The finding in this paper of no intrinsic effect of tenure accords with recent findings reported from a comparison of housing assistance types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012446992">Beer <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), which found poor health and wellbeing outcomes for many low-income individuals assisted into homeownership. Instead of benefiting from the tenure of homeownership, these individuals had worse health and wellbeing outcomes because they did not receive many of the welfare protections provided in the public housing system (such as capped housing costs and scheduled maintenance) and, at the same time, were burdened by unaffordable mortgages. Together, what these findings suggest is that, rather than being detrimental for mental health, public housing is instead a place where those with worse mental health actually live, and therefore tenure should be the intervention point rather than the intervention to address social and health disadvantage.</p>
<p>Overall, this study contributes to an emerging evidence base on the relationship between housing and health in our cities and, importantly, by using a longitudinal approach we add evidence that acknowledges one of the major limitations in understanding this complex relationship—causation. The provision of housing is an increasingly important issue for governments and, although policy levers in countries like Australia have tended to focus on homeownership, our work suggests that policies to broaden that focus to include both public and private renting would also be beneficial.</p>
