<p>Business process outsourcing (BPO) has become a key component of any global business model. One of the main BPO hubs in the world is India with its large pool of relatively-skilled human capital and lower wages. However, the BPO industry in India is maturing and facing constraints and challenges to further expansion. Some of these constraints include lack of employable talent, social norms, increasing operational cost and breaches of security in handling clients’ confidential data. This paper aims to examine Indian BPO companies’ aim to mitigate and resolve these constraints to growth. Some of the possible solutions to tightening labour market and increasing operational costs included recruitment and relocating BPO companies to tier two and three cities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to a report issued by Dubai Outsource Zone (DOZ) in collaboration with global business research and consulting firm Frost &amp; Sullivan, the outsourcing industry is embarking on a growth path with global revenues projected to touch US$479.3 billion by 2016 from US$370 billion in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611426236">DOZ, 2011</xref>). The report has further revealed that the global outsourcing markets will register a compound annual growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611426236">International Business [IB] Times, 2011</xref>). The information technology (IT) industry in India has gained global recognition and is the third largest contributor to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Once a hindrance, the state is becoming less of an obstacle by promoting less restrictive policies, private sector investment and performance in the sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611426236">Evans, 1992</xref>: 6). In 2008, in terms of the global BPO industry, India contributed to more than 35% of the worldwide BPO market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611426236">National Association of Software and Services Companies [NASSCOM], 2008</xref>: 1). In 2010, the President of NASSCOM, Som Mittal, commented that India’s share of the global outsourcing industry had increased from 51% in 2009 to 55% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611426236">IB Times, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The IT sector has spawned a lucrative sub-industry on business process outsourcing (BPO) of IT-enabled services (ITES). The boom in the BPO/ITES industry coincided with the outsourcing of labour intensive back office work such as call centres. In 2008, the global Business Process Offshoring market was worth about US$30 billion and growing at 35% per annum. In 2008, the Indian BPO industry was worth about US$11 billion and employed some 700,000 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611426236">NASSCOM, 2008</xref>: 1). In 2010, after the Global Financial Crisis, the BPO/IT industry (excluding hardware) had a quick rebound in growth and was estimated to grow by 19%, aggregating in revenues of US$76 billion. While exports continued to be the mainstay of the BPO industry with revenue of US$59 billion, the Indian domestic market also demonstrated steady growth of 16% in this sector to aggregate US$17 billion. In the BPO sector in the fiscal year 2009, direct employment was expected to reach nearly 2.54 million and indirect employment about 8 million across the country. As a proportion of national GDP, the sector revenues are estimated to reach 6.4% by the end of 2011.</p>

<title>Statement of the Problem</title>
<p>The emergence of knowledge-based economies (KBEs) in developing countries has the potential to leapfrog these economies to compete in the globalized services sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611426236">Rooney et al., 2003</xref>). While reducing labour costs is a main reason for outsourcing, it is not the only driver: other determinants include the need to improve quality of service and providing new services for customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611426236">Kaplan, 2002</xref>). The rise of the KBEs also illustrates that the distinction between white collar and blue collar workers is an archaic concept because both categories are subjected to the same conditionalities of business cost reduction and profit maximization. The advance of technological developments increased their commonalities, which made white collar service employment just as vulnerable as blue collar work. The convergence of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector has fuelled economic growth but has increased the displacement of service jobs from developed to developing economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611426236">Rooney et al., 2003</xref>). The rise of the global IT industry and the outsourcing of various services to lower-cost developing countries are performed through the spatially unbundling of tasks and relocating them to the most productive locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611426236">Wilson, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>The aim of this paper will be to examine the constraints to growth and the social and economic impact of the BPO/ITES sector, especially the call centres, on society in India. The BPO/ITES industry was deemed to be a silver lining in India’s economy, but reports of psychological stress and social problems have also surfaced to wipe the shiny gloss off the industry. This paper will argue that various initiatives are needed to maintain India’s competitiveness in this industry, such as increased security procedures and proper handling of clients’ confidential data. The reported leaks of clients’ confidential data and of them being sold for profit by call centre agents in India have increased fears of identity thefts by criminal syndicates. In addition, the training which the call centre workers or agents have gone through, such as voice neutralization or adopting a pseudonym, contributed to social ills.</p>
<p>While the temptations of big city life would also play a part in the challenges faced by the BPO agents, would relocating the call centres to rural outlying areas help to reduce social problems? With regards to personnel training in the BPO/ITES industry, serious security lapses have also been attributed to lack of training related to safe handling and guarding of clients’ data. Reports being surfaced showed that BPO/ITES employees were not trained to be security conscious and were heavily reliant on physical security. The lapses in data security and crimes related to them are likely to tarnish the reputation of the Indian IT sector globally.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021909611426236">Table 1</xref> shows that India’s BPO/IT sectors are very much dependent on export markets for growth. Its domestic sector, especially for BPO services, is less than a quarter of its exports’ worth. During the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, the BPO sector showed signs of consolidating and this was strengthened by the Indian Rupee’s steady appreciation that has prevented newer and smaller firms from undercutting their established competitors. These newer firms are more discerning in quoting unrealistic rates for outsourced work. According to one of the pioneers of the BPO industry in India, Raman Roy the chairman and managing director of BPO firm Quattro, in relation to the Global Financial Crisis ‘we are already seeing a much easier employee hiring situation as a fallout’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611426236">Knowledge@Wharton, 2008</xref>). Whereas before the Global Financial Crisis employees were more mobile with the incentive of higher wages, which contributed to the high labour attrition or ‘turnover’ rate, the employment market became more stable after the crisis. Post Global Financial Crisis in 2009, BPO/IT firms became more discerning in quoting prices when bidding for contracts. This has also dampened the demand for talent to fuel growth at any cost and provided a ‘breather’ to the industry from the high rates of attrition in previous years. However, the scenario lasted less than a year in 2009 and wage increases began to accelerate again in 2010.</p>

As the industry is dependent on wage arbitrage, the future trend will be to relocate the industry from the relatively expensive metro cities to the lower-cost tier two and tier three cities in more outlying areas. The price of land in India’s city centres can be more costly than equivalent land parcels in Europe. For example, in the suburbs of Chennai (state capital of Tamil Nadu) in the south of India, or Gurgaon near New Delhi (federal capital), an acre of 4,046 square metres could easily cost US$600,000, and locations in city centres are likely to be more expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611426236">Belhoste and Grasset, 2008</xref>: 27).</p>

<p>The BPO industry is also labour-intensive and the success of the BPO firm is directly dependent on the acquisition and development of skilled human resources adept in technical and soft skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021909611426236">Subramanian, 2005</xref>: 12). By 2012, future projections for the total export BPO market opportunity will be approximately US$220–280 billion, while the domestic Indian BPO market could provide an additional US$15–25 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611426236">NASSCOM, 2008</xref>: 2). However, to capture a significant portion of the available opportunity, there are various potential constraints to be considered. These include: supply side constraints such as talent and infrastructure; emerging competition from offshore destinations; cost advantage and economic value proposition; and evolving buyer expectations that result in increased value proposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611426236">NASSCOM, 2008</xref>: 4).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0021909611426236">
<title>Performance of BPO IT Companies</title>
<p>The competitive business environment of metro cities such as Delhi and Mumbai has seen operational costs escalating, especially with regards to labour. While the cost of infrastructure will be initially high and available talent in the lower tier cities might not be as good as the metro cities, however, BPO IT companies might not have a choice. With the economy booming in the first half of 2008 companies were facing higher training and recruitment costs, but with the high labour attrition or churn rates, companies were investing millions but lost trained personnel to rivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611426236">Goel and Thakur, 2007</xref>). In order to reduce costs, companies had cast their recruitment net further into the hinterlands but less than a third of the recruits selected would sign up because they would have to cut familial ties and the cost of living in the city was too expensive. According to Raman Roy, the chairman and managing director of BPO firm Quattro, the pattern of BPO recruitment has changed: he said ‘about 60% to 70% happens in smaller towns, where the BPO doesn’t have a presence. And of those selected, just 20% to 30% accept; the rest don’t move’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611426236"><italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>, 2010</xref>). The president of NASSCOM Som Mittal commented that the model that has been tried by non-governmental agencies (NGOs) for establishing service delivery centres in rural areas is attracting outsourcing companies as well. Approximately, 60% of BPO employees in the cities originate from small towns and villages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611426236">Ribeiro, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021909611426236">Table 3</xref> shows that, in 2002, India had one of the lowest attrition rates in the BPO-IT sector at 18% compared to more developed economies. However, by 2007 the average attrition rate of the BPO/IT sector had increased to about 50–55%. With the global financial meltdown it appears employees prefer to remain in their current jobs as much as possible. In November 2008 BPO attrition rate fell to 30%. The attrition rate in the following leading companies are: Infosys BPO 28%; Wipro BPO 18%; TCS BPO 21–22% and Tesco HSC has seen a 6% drop in attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611426236">Bpo.org, 2008</xref>). In 2010, the general level of labour attrition in the BPO/ITES sector had increased steadily and is between 40 to 70% per year.</p>

<p>The future growth of the Indian BPO industry is dependent on the supply of human capital at all levels. The current strategy of hiring ‘ready to eat’ talent has to be altered because this will lead to a shortage of 800,000 to 1.2 million entry-level graduates by 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611426236">NASSCOM, 2008</xref>: 4). This shortage of talent will be further aggravated by domestic competition from the service sector in the areas of retail, insurance, telecommunication and banking industries. Human capital in middle management with domain experience will be in short supply as well as those with sector-specific skills such as actuaries for Insurance BPO. This will impact directly on recruitment and training costs. Another complication to hiring entry-level talent is access to these employable talents in remote locations beyond the tier one cities.</p>
<p>Among the various constraints, human capital has the most direct impact on the social and cultural aspects of Indian society. The lower end of the attrition spectrum involves non-voice (transaction processing) tasks and the upper end involves voice-related tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611426236">Goel and Thakur, 2007</xref>: 3). What are the causes of increasing labour attrition? <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021909611426236">Table 4</xref> shows some of the internal and external causes for high labour attrition rates in the BPO industry. It is forecasted that tier two and three cities have to meet at least 50% of additional talent requirements for the BPO industry. From the Indian census of 2001, Indian cities are now classified as tier one, tier two and tier three in terms of IT and real estate services. According to Samantak Das, national head of research, Knight Frank India:
<disp-quote>
<p>As per real estate glossary there is no clear-cut definition of tier one, two, or three cities. It has to evolve based on certain parameters, which will give a real estate perspective to this classification. However, the census defines cities as class one, class two, etc. based on the population in the city. At Knight Frank, we classify Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and Kolkata as tier one cities. The rest of the cities fall in tier two and tier three. Important tier two cities that we work on are Pune and Hyderabad. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611426236">Bushan, 2010</xref>)</p>

<p>This will result in changes to the physical and social infrastructure of these cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611426236">NASSCOM, 2008</xref>: 4). Increasing urban real estate prices is also likely to drive BPO companies from the urban to rural areas.</p>
<p>According to NASSCOM, despite the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, the BPO revenue in India increased by 6% in 2009 but the crisis in the Euro zone may have an adverse impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611426236">Ribeiro, 2010</xref>). However, the future of the BPO industry in India is in big doubt because of significant constraints in the availability of talent at all levels. As business recovers the hiring and retention of staff – especially quality staff – will be a problem as wages increased by 8–10%. The president of NASSCOM, Som Mittal, predicted that wages could increase by as much as 10–20% by the end of 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611426236">Ribeiro, 2010</xref>). In addition, the expanding Indian economy has seen the growth of all sectors such as retail, insurance, telecom and banking which accounts for greater competition for scarce talent. In addition to shortages of employable labour, the BPO/IT sector has also influenced changes in Indian society.</p>

<title>Lifestyle Changes</title>
<p>The Indian youths working at the call centres earn around Rs10,000–15,000 (US$233–349) per month, more than double that of the earlier generation. Women form about a quarter of the BPO workforce. The call centre workers – called agents – have their salaries structured around incentives which are based on performance and adherence to predefined parameters. This financial independence has made a significant impact in altering lifestyles in terms of spending patterns and social interaction. On rising consumerism, the current Indian generation is dining out frequently, spending more on entertainment, buying branded consumer and electrical goods, and putting a down-payment for a house and a car. The BPO knowledge workers are undertaking steps such as purchasing a house or car in their mid-twenties or early thirties, something which their parents’ generation would only have committed to in their mid- to late-thirties. Some of the main social and psychological problems encountered include: working in a high pressure environment to meet targets, working night shifts, mixing with the opposite gender (agents from more rural areas and remote areas may not have mixed freely with the opposite gender), inability to maintain contact with family members, and living in a unreal world because of the need to assume a fake identity and persona at the call centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611426236">Srivastava, 2007</xref>). Call centre agents report of decreasing contacts with friends working regular hours and family members, even on weekends.</p>
<p>Some of the larger BPO firms have Automated Call Distribution (ACD) technology and provide standard scripts to facilitate the agents’ responses; call centre firms keeps the ‘free time’ between calls to the minimum. An average call centre agent in the United States (US) might have 45 seconds between calls but an agent in India would only have 5 to 10 seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611426236">Nadeem, 2011</xref>). The result is an internalization of time-discipline which is usually manifested in a psychological pressure to perform and will lead to more stress if they don’t meet their targets. The Indian agents could handle between 200 to 250 calls per day. The close monitoring of the agents and their work with specially-designed software and closed circuit camera adds to the psychological stress placed on agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611426236">Pratap, 2011</xref>). Agents also face difficulty in applying for leave and were not able to go on sick leave without prior permission. The unnatural working hours, heavy work load, excessive overtime, and continuous and monotonous work without rest have caused a series of health problems. These include nervousness, chronic fatigue, body ache and insomnia among others. The individualized work culture and lack of space for social interactions at the call centres are turning the agents into asocial individuals that are detached from society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611426236">Pratap, 2011</xref>). In the BPO sector, job security is also lacking, with permanent staff just as vulnerable as temporary staff to the prospect of retrenchment.</p>
<p>Agents from smaller towns often face the brunt of jokes because of their lack of social skills and heavy accent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611426236">Sachitanand, 2003</xref>). In addition, psychiatrists have commented, when a fake identity seems more worthy than that of the agent’s own Indian identity, his life may spin out of control because of the ‘dis-inhibition’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909611426236">1</xref></sup> effect. This is because, as the agents live far from home and work night shifts, the normal inhibitions that prevail might not be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611426236">Srivastava, 2007</xref>). In August 2010, a multimedia messaging service (MMS) video clip of an alleged BPO supervisor’s sexual escapades with his female subordinate, titled ‘Gurgaon call centre sex scandal’, proved popular on the internet. The BPO workers have often been labeled as ‘loose’ or ‘available’ because they are mostly in their early twenties, single and working late night shifts. While the BPO workers have protested against this negative stereotyping, a Reuters global survey of about 12,000 BPO workers in 24 countries indicated sexual harassment is a problem in India. In the survey, India had the highest reported rate of sexual harassment of 26% followed by Saudi Arabia at 16%, Mexico 13% and South Africa 10%.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, the BPO sector has provided employment opportunities for thousands of women and challenging the norms in a patriarchal society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611426236">Pradhan and Abraham, 2005</xref>). Is this a social reform movement at work? Women are well regarded in the industry because they are perceived to be more hardworking, patient, loyal and better with interpersonal skills than men. Initially, some families were concerned that social taboos might stigmatize their daughters working in the call centres because of the late working hours and alleged wild partying. However, these negative perceptions are improving because of the secure working environment, higher salaries, gender-neutral (zero tolerance for sexual abuse), free pick-up and drop-off facility at home. In short, the BPO sector is highly sought after by a majority of women and it has also boosted their confidence, given them a more positive outlook to life and is overall empowering.</p>
<p>Some of the ways to reduce turnover would be to create jobs with more discretion and less scripting and electronic monitoring because this would enable agents to engage with customers and respond directly to their requests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611426236">Batt et al., 2005</xref>: 22). A more systematic and coherent work and human resources practices would also create a system that improves the quality of jobs and service.</p>
<p>Is the relocation of BPO and ITES companies to tier two and three cities and the hinterland possible given the relative lack of IT infrastructure? The perception of tier two and three cities and hinterlands as backward should change with more infrastructure, especially power and telecommunications connectivity coming online. Increasingly, companies are relocating their BPO operations to rural areas in India. The local labour market conditions are also critical in the relocation of BPO companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611426236">Batt et al., 2005</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>However, while the relocation may be advantageous to the companies and hinterland human capital in terms of education and employment opportunities, it will have social implications, such as encouraging consumerism and changing lifestyle patterns. Within India, large numbers of human capital, especially in the IT sector, would migrate to the metro cities for employment purposes; therefore, the relocation of BPO companies to the hinterland would influence trends of rural to urban migration. The relocation of IT/ITES jobs to the lower tier cities and hinterland would also create a ‘spillover effect’ not only in terms of income and employment generation but also in development of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611426236">Rajeev and Vani, 2007</xref>: 175). Would companies benefit from relocation? From an industry perspective, smaller towns are more cost-effective and have better potential for development. For example, Some BPO companies such as Vindhya have examined their business operations and hiring differently able people in the name of philanthropy. The company employs workers with physical disabilities such as hearing impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611426236">NASSCOM, 2011b</xref>). With about 190 people, Vindhya’s competitive edge is derived from the productivity of its people and there is no cost arbitrage because the firm pays market-base salaries. The workers are more productive because distraction levels are very low and the company has lower levels of attrition rate from 5–8% compared to the average 50% in the industry. The team of workers at Vindhya are mainly dealing with loan processing, human resource process fulfillment and claims processing but are also undertaking some knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611426236">NASSCOM, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Another example is Tata Power Company Limited which relocated its BPO and which, in September 2009, opened its first rural business process outsourcing (BPO) unit at Khopoli, about 80km south of India’s financial capital, Mumbai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611426236">Sharma, 2010</xref>). Experimental in its conception, in 2010 the unit employed 192 people, up 300% from 2009. Most of the staff in the company were local unemployed youths who would have migrated to urban centres if the unit had not been set up. According to Tata Power it was an example of how companies in corporate India can help empower people in rural areas and create self-sustained communities, and it plans to the number of employees at its Khopoli centre to 360. Simultaneously, its parent company, Tata Group, is mulling over recruiting 5,000 people in rural BPO units over the next few years.</p>
<p>What are the incentives to relocating? As mentioned, one of the primary reasons is lower operating costs because, in urban centres like New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad, real estate prices have skyrocketed. People in big cities also expect higher salaries, whereas companies in rural areas can hire a person for US$100 a month for an eight-hour shift – almost half of what BPO units in cities pay to an employee. In total, companies can save 40–60% on the operating cost if they open BPO units in rural areas. Another key attraction are incentives given by state governments such as tax holidays and subsidies to promote investment in rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611426236">Sharma, 2010</xref>). For example, the Karnataka government provides 10,000 rupees (US$214) per agent to each company that sets up the BPO centre in rural parts of the state. On top of that the companies also get a discount of 50% on internet bills. In August 2010, the Tamil Nadu government also announced that it would provide a capital subsidy of up to 300,000 rupees (US$6,430) and a training subsidy of 1,500 rupees (US$32) per month for each person to BPO companies that wish to start up business in the state’s rural areas. Now, many other states are planning to emulate these policies to create jobs in rural areas.</p>
<p>However, one key area that the BPO/ITES industry has to manage is the central issue concerning security of clients’ data. For example, Rural Shores is a BPO company that has seven operational centres in the rural areas. Upon recruitment its new employees are provided three- to four-month training which includes client-based processes and soft skill thinking. The company does rule-based transaction processing and local language support and customer correspondence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909611426236">NASSCOM, 2011a</xref>). Its clients include banks, insurance companies and other large BPO who farm out work to Rural Shores.</p>

<sec id="section6-0021909611426236">
<title>Data Security</title>
<p>While Indian BPO/ITES companies have physical measures in place, the human element is proving a stumbling block for upward movement of the industry in the value chain. The Indian government is understandably concerned about security because it would affect the country’s IT branding and image in global business. Data protection laws and a security consciousness among its companies and employees are critical for India in order for the country to move from the low-end BPO activities such as call centres to the high-end BPO work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611426236">Business Line, 2005</xref>). However, several incidents involving security lapses in India does not instill confidence among potential clients regarding the professionalism and capabilities of Indian BPO/ITES companies. For example, former call centre employees of BPO/ITES firm Mphasis in Pune were alleged to siphon US$500,000 from US consumers’ bank accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611426236"><italic>The New York Times</italic>, 2005</xref>). An analyst at Forrester Research commented that the incident was not a ‘lapse of judgment or an issue of poor customer service. The incident was an organized and systematic plot to steal customer’s money’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611426236">Frauenheim, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The human capital element of the BPO industry also influences the security of data from its clients. High-profile incidents included HSBC’s offshore operation in Bangalore where Nadeem Kashmiri, a data operator, was arrested for computer hacking charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611426236">BBC News, 2006</xref>). Subsequently, Nadeem sold the customer data to fraudsters who then tapped into funds from a number of customers in the United Kingdom (UK) up to US$424,832. Fortunately, the fraud was detected by internal systems in place at the call centre since 2002. The affected UK customers were notified by HSBC and the bank reimbursed them all funds that had been taken. Understandably, NASSCOM was very concerned and vice president Sunil Mehta commented ‘We believe that any case of theft or a breach of customer’s confidentiality must be treated extremely seriously’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611426236">BBC News, 2006</xref>). However, the spokesman for the UK’s National Association of Banking and Insurance Customers, Adrian Graves said that ‘We’ve expressed concern about the foreign location of call centres for some considerable time, we know that customers prefer to deal with call centres that are based here in the UK where they don’t have any language difficulties and where they can contact their local branch and deal with real people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611426236">BBC News, 2006</xref>). In 2006, in an undercover sting operation undertaken by the UK’s Channel 4, a 29-year old executive from a Kolkatta-based BPO company had sold confidential data to the channel’s undercover reporter for US$15 (Rs684). The confidential data comprised of names, addresses, and bank account details.</p>
<p>In February 2005, employees from a firm named ChoicePoint, a major provider of identification and credential verification services, sold the personal data of some 145,000 individuals to criminals posing as small firms. In November 2005, four employees of Indian BPO Parsec Technologies were arrested for allegedly stealing classified information. Parsec Services had stored information about housing mortgages in the US; ex-employees of Parsec had diverted the contact information of potential mortgage finance customers to a firm they had set up called Telequest Systems. Telequest Systems in turn passed the information on to other call centres. A former employee of Geometric Software Solutions, tried to sell source code from Solid Works, its US buyer, to another US based company.</p>
<p>Looking at the example of Mphasis and security breaches, the company began establishing the infrastructure and internet protocols for its outsourcing business to attract foreign clients in late 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611426236"><italic>The Financial Express</italic>, 2004</xref>). The business strategy was aimed at companies who wanted captive centres for greater security, or those that did not want to tangle with investment overheads, tax regulations, recruitment and daily operational chores. Mphasis then established such set-ups for HSBC in Pune and transferred it to the bank once it was completed. Some employees of Mphasis in Pune were then involved in fraudulent activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611426236">Mphasis, 2005</xref>). In April 2005, several employees of Mphasis in Bangalore were caught using clients’ passwords and fraudulently withdrawing funds from the New York accounts of Citibank customers. However, this incident did not involve a breach of the company’s security network and not hacking into the technical encryption data. The fraud was more related to the conduct of ex-employees who had misused passwords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611426236">Rediff.com, 2005</xref>). These employees had also tricked callers into giving up the information voluntarily. In mid-2005, the chairman of Mphasis BFL commented that, ‘Consumers in countries where our clients are located should not feel at risk that strange foreign people with unpronounceable names sitting some 20,000 miles away are handling sensitive information’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611426236">Rai, 2006</xref>). Critics of the government pointed out that the industry is unregulated and the government has lost control because of ignorance.</p>
<p>A survey conducted by the consultancy Forrester Research discovered that Indian BPO/ITES companies were confusing gadgets and technology for a culture of security. Most of the Indian BPO/ITES firms underestimate the human element of security, such as the lack of communication for data security to their employees, fully. It was reported that the BPO/IT employees commented that steps like physical security measures to control access, patrolling guards and screenings were disproportionate to the risks. Some even claimed that management is only partially serious about the security of data and most measures are taken for clients’ sake or in response to peer and media pressure. In late 2006, a British documentary on Channel 4 had infiltrated criminal networks in India that traded British consumers’ bank and other confidential information for huge profits at call centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611426236">Rai, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Another survey undertaken by Ernst and Young in 2004 on global information listed major viruses and internet worms as the key concerns in India. Employee misconduct, ranked as number two worldwide, was only listed at number three. As a reflection of these findings, 91% of Indian respondents have anti-virus systems, 56% have specific anti-spam protection for their networks, but only 40% provided their employees with ongoing training in security and control. The NASSCOM planned to launch a national employee-screening programme in an attempt to curb online crime but experts are sceptical that this would work. Following revelations of its security breaches, Mphasis supported NASSCOM’s employee registry plan and other internal security measures. These included automated workflows, replacing note pads with notebooks and enabling a completely paperless office to process insurance claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611426236">Trombly, 2006</xref>). Other measures would be a series of devices installed to keep employees from accessing client data and increasing the efficiency of removing access privileges for former employees. However, the Indian government should intervene to strengthen security lapses and NASSCOM could advice the government on the problems that needs to be addressed, such as identity thefts and online money scams.</p>
<p>One of the key legislations used to govern the IT sector was The Information Technology Act 2000. The IT Act was meant to regulate the legal recognition of electronic documents, legal recognition of digital signatures offenses and contraventions, and justice dispensation systems for cybercrimes. The IT Act has been substantially amended through the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611426236">Information Technology Amendment Act (ITAA) 2008</xref> which was passed by the Indian parliament in December 2008. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611426236">ITAA 2008</xref> as the new version of Information Technology Act 2000 has provided additional focus on information security. It has added several new sections on offences, including cyber terrorism and data protection. One of the key amendments on cyber security is;
<disp-quote>
<p>Section 69 empowers the central government/state government/its authorized agency to intercept, monitor or decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource if it is necessary or expedient so to do in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defense of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence or for investigation of any offence. They can also secure assistance from computer personnel in decrypting data under penalty of imprisonment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611426236">ITAA, 2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Data Security Council of India (DSCI) has also been established to help govern the IT sector. The DSCI is a not-for-profit organization created to promote India as a secure destination for information technology outsourcing for worldwide clients. DSCI was established by NASSCOM. DSCI recognized the need that, as India’s BPO and KPO companies deal with organizations from around the world, they have to be aware of, and compliant with, regulatory standards specific to each country. The DSCI has created a framework of best practices for BPO/IT service providers in various sectors such as banking and financial services, manufacturing, e-governance, telecom, public sector units (PSU) and e-commerce companies. The DSCI framework is based on established security standards such as ISO 27001 and PCI DSS.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021909611426236">2</xref></sup> In a state of security data survey undertaken by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611426236">DSCI and Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler (KPMG; 2010)</xref>, the strong drivers for data privacy are reputational damage, end customer concerns over trans-border data flow (73% combined), global data protection regulations (65%), data privacy clauses client’s contracts (56%), client’s privacy programme (50%), protecting privacy of employee data (48%) and data protection authorities (33%). The DSCI-KPMG survey showed that most of the BPO organizations do not fear the data protection authorities. However, the BPO companies are conscious that a small incident of data breach resulting in bad publicity could impact adversely on their brand image and cause concerns to their customers overseas.</p>
<p>In 2005, the writer had also visited several BPO/IT centres in India and observed that physical security measures are in place in several companies, such as controlled access to restricted areas with thumb print recognition locks, paperless work environment and the ability for auditors from clients’ companies to gain access and conduct spot checks on data security without prior notice. In 2010, Forrester reported that most firms have implemented tools such as antivirus and antispyware, network access control, stringent user ID/password controls and anti-spam software. However, the Forrester report commented that the tools and technologies which the companies had implemented were meant to put their clients at ease rather than to coherently reduce threats. While most of the companies have a chief operating officer whom reports directly to the chief executive officer (CEO), many mentioned that they only receive attention when there is a security breach or when an incident is reported in the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611426236">Eluvangal, 2010</xref>). The measures had fallen short in relation to personnel training and vetting of staff.</p>
<p>In August 2011, <italic>The Sun</italic> – a British tabloid – ran a news story which detailed that thousands of bank and credit card details of British clients held by call centres in India were being peddled to criminal gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611426236">Flynn, 2011</xref>). The brokers of this confidential information based in India said that they have insiders working at several call centres and were able to obtain the data from the broadband when customers do a direct debit. The information on offer included bank account details, personal data and credit card numbers with the three digit security code needed for use on the phone or web, and even online account passwords were offered. The UK’s Fraud Prevention Service commented that the information being traded is everything a criminal needed to clear out an account or steal an identity. They advised that security processes and staff vetting have to be reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611426236">Flynn, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The Information Commissioner’s Office, an independent authority established in the UK to protect personal information, pointed out that a company outsourcing work within the UK or overseas has to comply with the UK Data Protection Act. The business that is outsourcing has to ensure that steps are taken for data protection and compliance made for security measures to be in place. However, how would compliance be ensured overseas? Some of the innovative strategies being used to curb BPO fraudsters are to publish lists of companies and individuals that are known to be involved in scams. Such websites that expose fraudulent companies and individuals include the BPO VOICE (a site for BPO professionals; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bpovoice.com/">http://www.bpovoice.com/</ext-link>). The DSCI-KPMG survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611426236">2010</xref>) commented that BPO companies are moving towards deploying dedicated personnel to manage privacy issues because 41% of the companies surveyed have more than two members in their teams dedicated to privacy function.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The BPO industry has been vilified by foreign politicians and blamed for the flight of jobs overseas and the inability of the salaried middle class in particular to benefit from economic growth. However, the BPO industry is part and parcel of the corporate strategy and companies will not survive without some element of outsourcing. The BPO/ITES industry illustrated the opportunities available for over two knowledge workers in India. Established against a background of economic uncertainty and accused of gaining jobs at the expense of the developed countries, especially the US, the industry has been at the forefront of global corporate restructuring. The social and economic impact was manifested in several ways, such as increasing consumerism and altering social habits. The training undertaken by BPO companies contributed to the alteration of the agents’ life styles. By relocating companies to the outlying or rural areas, operating costs are decreased but the social problems do remain.</p>
<p>As India assumes a larger role in the global outsourcing industry some key issues, such as security lapses, have surfaced that have adversely impacted on India’s branding as a leading BPO hub. Thus far, what the government and Indian BPO companies have implemented to tighten data security are in the technical and legislative areas but seem to be mere ‘window dressing’ to assuage clients’ concerns. Actual awareness and training to maintain the confidentiality of clients’ data seem to be lacking. Punishment for breaches of security and cyber crime seem to be punitive at best and the legal recourse in India is infamous for its glacial pace. Some client companies have relooked into their outsourcing requirements and have relocated most of the confidential data handling back to within their own borders.</p>

<p>Increased disinhibition online is thought to be one of the side effects of computer-mediated communication; that is, communication between ourselves and a computer. Adam Joinson discusses disinhibition online in a book chapter entitled, Disinhibited Internet Behaviour: Causes and Implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611426236">2007</xref>). As Grohol writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Thus, if inhibition is when behaviour is constrained or restrained through self-consciousness, anxiety about social situations, worries about public evaluation, and so on, then disinhibition can be characterized by an absence or reversal of these same factors. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611426236">Dunn and Rogers (1982)</xref> see disinhibition as a product of reduced public self-awareness, which should lead to less concern about the judgement of others. With regard to an individual’s behaviour on the internet, disinhibition could be summarized as behaviour that is less inhibited than comparative behaviour in real life. Thus disinhibition on the internet is not defined as flaming or hostile communication, but rather is seen as any behaviour that is characterized by an <italic>apparent</italic> reduction in concerns for self-presentation and the judgment of others.
