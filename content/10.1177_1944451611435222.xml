<disp-quote><p>“It’s refreshing that the most cutting edge therapy in the ICU now is not the newest bioengineered drug or the latest hemodynamic support device but rather, the use of such a low-tech thing as <italic>early mobilization</italic>.”</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This is not something that you’re likely to hear said to a patient in the ICU at this point. But some version of that line may not be that far away. In fact early mobilization—getting critically ill patients started on physical rehabilitation early in their ICU course—is just the starting point of an emerging effort to improve the long term consequences of surviving critical illness.</p>
<p>We’ve all had these patients, the relatively young, basically healthy person who becomes extremely ill, requires all the modern technology that the ICU has to offer, probably including a prolonged period of mechanical ventilation. They are slow to wean from respiratory support, perhaps undergo a tracheostomy and then, when they finally make it off the ventilator, are left physically weak as kittens after the ordeal. Furthermore, there are literally millions of older patients, Medicare enrollees, who are surviving a critical illness hospitalization but being left in a less independent and impaired state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451611435222">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>We congratulate ourselves for having saved their lives and declare victory in the short run that they made it out of the ICU. But up to now little has been known about their long-term outcomes. Uncovering this blind spot has become a point of emphasis for the Society for Critical Care Medicine. The organization has recognized the gap in our knowledge about the long-term outcomes of patients once they leave the ICU. Last year, the Society for Critical Care Medicine sponsored a conference that brought together ICU practitioners interested in this area and other stakeholders such as physical and occupational therapists and physicians from physical medicine and rehabilitation. The group tried, for the first time, to define what it means to survive the ICU and, more important, what can be done to facilitate recovery from critical illness. The proceedings of the conference are available online now and will appear in the February 2012 issue of <italic>Critical Care Medicine</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451611435222">2</xref></sup> They defined post–intensive care syndrome (PICS) as a new or worsening impairment in physical, cognitive, or mental health status arising after critical ilness and <italic>persisting</italic> beyond acute care hospitalization.</p>
<p>Two articles published in this issue of <italic>ICU Director</italic> take on one aspect of PICS. It’s refreshing that the most cutting edge therapy in the ICU now is not the newest bioengineered drug or the latest hemodynamic support device but rather, the use of such a low-tech thing as <italic>early mobilization</italic>. The first article by Lipshutz et al. provides an evidence-based review of the safety and efficacy of early mobilization and a primer on implementation. The second article nicely complements by providing an expanded discussion of the pathophysiology of critical illness polymyoneuropathy and describes the implementation of an early mobilization program at the University of Virginia Medical Center. These articles provide a nice introduction to the topic and practical advice for starting an early mobilization program at your hospital.</p>
<p>But it would be naïve to think that physical therapy alone, even if aggressive and initiated early in critical illness will be able to stave off or prevent all aspects of decline after a long ICU course. And that’s because there are also significant <italic>psychological</italic> and <italic>cognitive</italic> effects from ICU treatment. There is a high frequency of multiple impairments after critical illness. In addition, there is no recognized or well-defined pathway for rehabilitation following ICU survival such as is available for traumatic brain injury or stroke. Another important insight about PICS is that it may arise not only in patients surviving critical illness but also in their <italic>families</italic>. We hope that the 2 articles in this issue will only be the first of many that will more fully explore these other aspects of PICS.</p>
<p>In the rest of this issue we have an evidence-based review of sleep apnea and an update of the emergency treatment of head trauma patients—from the emergency department through the operating room to the ICU. There is also an original report on the predictive value of a cuff leak test for postextubation hoarseness. We round out the issue with ICU technology topics: (<italic>a</italic>) use of miniaturized transesophageal echo probes to follow hemodynamics over time and (<italic>b</italic>) an extremely well-documented case report using surface ultrasound to diagnose an aortic dissection.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this first issue of <italic>ICU Director</italic> in the new year.</p>
