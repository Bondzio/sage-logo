<abstract>
<p>The existing national policy framework vis-à-vis vaccines reflects an aggressive push towards introduction of new vaccines in the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) without providing an uncompromising scientific basis or committing itself to proven epidemiological needs of the population. The idea of selective immunisation is being undermined by slogans like ‘prevention is better than cure’ that are being trumped up to impart credibility to the effort, given shape by the projected panacea for all ills, that is, Public–Private Partnership (PPP), to push the line that all immunisation is universal. This article examines the aims and motives behind deliberate destruction of the public sector in favour of PPPs and establishes the need for a vaccine policy that is designed to enhance national public capacity for public immunisation programmes as opposed to the present policy that justifies spending public money on privately produced vaccines in the name of protection from diseases whose incidence figures and public health statistics are dubious and industry-manufactured.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vaccines are among the cost-effective preventive tools of disease management in primary health care. Vaccines are useful for mass immunisation especially against diseases that are spread uniformly in populations and when their use is balanced with other public health measures. One should not forget that other public health measures such as sanitation, hygiene, safe drinking water, good living conditions, nutrition brought down infectious diseases in western societies, even before vaccines were introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0049085713493044">Mackenbach et al., 2008</xref>; <uri>http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4829a1.htm</uri>). Traditionally, vaccines are developed, produced and supplied by public funded organisations all over the world. However, recent trends indicate just the contrary; where vaccines are produced predominantly by the private sector. Currently, the global vaccine business is dominated by the private industry concentrated in a few multinational corporations. The current world vaccine market is estimated to be at 22 billion and it is predicted to grow at a compound annual rate of 9.7 per cent in the next five years, according to health care market research publisher Kalorama Information (<uri>http://www.kaloramainformation.com/Vaccines-Key-Players-2684026/</uri>) and the Indian vaccine market is at US$2 billion, growing at the rate 22 per cent per annum (<uri>http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-04-13/news/29413716_1_vaccine-market-indian-market-green-signal-bio-pharma</uri>). Vaccines always constituted a small share of the global pharmaceutical industry. The vaccine market share that was around 0.3 per cent of pharmaceutical industry in the USA, and 0.1 per cent in India in the pre-1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049085713493044">Anonymous, 1985</xref>) has grown up to 2 per cent of the world pharmaceutical industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0049085713493044">Srinivas, 2004</xref>: 27). Vaccines have become the growth drivers of global pharmaceutical industry today and are indispensable due to global and national immunisation policies.</p>
<p>Trends in the last two decades in India show steep growth of private vaccine sector whose growth is reflected in the availability of abundant expensive new vaccines and their combinations. This is the case when there is shortage for primary vaccines that are under national immunisation programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0049085713493044">Madhavi, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0049085713493044">2009b</xref>). The shortage of primary vaccines is largely attributed to the closure of around 23 public sector units in the last 10 years. By February 2008, only four functional vaccine PSUs existed in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0049085713493044">Madhavi, 2009b</xref>). The growth of private sector in India did not contribute to the reduction of demand–supply gaps in primary vaccines, as the private sector is interested in profitable new expensive vaccines. In fact, the steep growth of the private sector and the declining role of the public sector due to liberalisation distorted national immunisation and vaccine policies in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0049085713493044">Madhavi, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0049085713493044">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0049085713493044">2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0049085713493044">2009b</xref>). The rate at which vaccine markets are growing and the aggressive vaccine promotional trends through a number of factors such as: (a) industry-sponsored advocacy; (b) donations; (c) international alliances (the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), etc.); (d) global organisations (WHO, WB, UNDP, etc.); (e) advance market commitments; and (f) PPPs indicate that the ‘supply push’ factors have come to determine the use of ‘vaccines’ in public health. The current vaccine promotional trends indicate that vaccines are increasingly becoming the ideology of public health as ‘one vaccine fits all’ for all populations alike though pathogen strain specificity, variability and suitability from which vaccines are made is an important determinant of the suitability of the vaccine to local populations. Indian experience in vaccines is a glaring example and it underscores the need for an evidence-based sustainable national vaccine policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0049085713493044">Madhavi et al., 2010</xref>) for appropriate use of vaccines that are needed for public health for Universal Health Care (UHC). Given this background, the current article analyses the context and the place of vaccines under UHC offered by UPA government in its 12th Five-year Plan (FYP) to achieve health for all and its implication for public health, disease management and national health security.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0049085713493044">
<title>Vaccines under Universal Health Care (UHC)</title>
<p>Vaccines received very little attention in the working group reports of the Planning commission for the 12th FYP under the banner ‘universal health care’, where emphasis was laid on access to essential medicines. There is no separate chapter on vaccines either in the High Level Expert Group (HLEG) or Steering committee reports of the Planning Commission, though importance of vaccine use was acknowledged, and emphasis was laid on continuation of mass immunisation of all existing vaccines (TT, DT, DPT, Measles, BCG, OPV and hepatitis B) under the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) which is also referred to as the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) or National Immunisation Programme (NIP). Selective immunisation of JE vaccine in endemic regions was also recommended.</p>
<p>The Working Group on Communicable Diseases chapter documented the formation of a new technical centre for vaccine preventable diseases that was approved in the 11th FYP by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in 2010 as a part of expansion of National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The mandate of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases is to work strategies for Polio/Measles/MMR/Meningitis, Rabies, viral Hepatitis and newer vaccines vigilance and policies.</p>
<p>The Working Group of the Planning Commission in its pharmaceuticals chapter makes a passing mention of vaccines and sera under Public Sector Units (PSU) section and it is non-committal on vaccine PSU capacity building. It completely ignores the ongoing heated debate on Indian vaccine PSUs and their significant contribution in the development and production of EPI vaccines at crucial times when the demand–supply gap was at its peak since the closure of three crucial PSUs in January 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0049085713493044">Javed Chowdhury Committee Report, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0049085713493044">Madhavi, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0049085713493044">2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0049085713493044">Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health Reports, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0049085713493044">2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0049085713493044">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0049085713493044">2011</xref>). Despite shortcomings, PSUs have always met immunisation needs in times of crisis. This is a reflection of the fact that they can play a pivotal role in the production of essential vaccines (based on the need backed by scientific evidence) to suit Indian population. However, it is not clear whether this deliberate silence in the Planning Commission reports on vaccine PSUs is to let private sector and large multinational companies (MNC) capture the PSU’s captive universal vaccine market through combination vaccines (pentavalent vaccines) in the future. The public sector is clearly sidelined in the policy discourse as the PPP model becomes the favourite slogan. This is evident from the fact that Union Health ministry has allotted ₹594 crores for the upcoming new vaccine park spread over 100 acres in Chengalpattu in Tamil Nadu (<uri>http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-31/india/31266333_1_measles-vaccine-second-dose-universal-immunization-programme</uri>) with the PPP model, while vaccine PSUs that are under the same ministry are struggling to become WHO–cGMP compliant.</p>
<p>A review of PPPs to access vaccines that are needed, an analysis of local evidence to establish vaccine need, a national vaccine policy for a rational decision making in the following sub-sections would put the entire vaccine debate in context and its relevance in UHC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0049085713493044">
<title>Public–Private Partnerships and Distorted Vaccine Needs</title>
<p>According to the WHO, PPP is a ‘means to bring together a set of actors for the common goal of improving the health of the population based on the mutually agreeable roles and principles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0049085713493044">WHO, 1999</xref>). Though the concept of PPP is defined by various scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049085713493044">Balgescu &amp; Young, 2005</xref>) and agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0049085713493044">UNDP, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0049085713493044">World Bank, 1999</xref>), the most commonly used definition in the health arena is that proposed by Kent Buse and Gill Walt, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0049085713493044">Buse &amp; Walt, 2000</xref>): ‘A collaborative relationship, which transcends national boundaries and brings together at least three parties, among them a corporation (and/or industry association), and an inter-government organization, so as to achieve a shared health-creating goal on the basis of a mutually agreed division of labour’.</p>
<p>PPPs have evolved post-1990s as a means to solve all health related problems. It is perceived as complimenting each sector’s strengths to meet a common goal to achieve equity in health between rich and poor countries. The enthusiasm for a PPP approach to global health problems arose in response to convergence of a number of forces during the mid- and late-1990s. First was the growing scepticism directed at an entirely private sector-driven approach. Second was a growing pattern of collaboration in the US between the government, private universities and private pharmaceutical companies etc. as initiated by the Bayh–Doyle Act. Third was the decision by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, etc., to rely on the PPP model to address the growing worldwide crises of HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other major diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0049085713493044">Donald, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Collaboration of academic institutions with industry to develop specific medical products and therapies has become a common trend in 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049085713493044">Blumenthal et al., 1996</xref>). Organisations such as the WB, UNDP, and WHO actively encouraged constructive partnerships with private sector under the theme of comprehensive development programme. The growth of international Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) and their new interaction with private firms and international organisations has also increased in 1990s. Private foundations in the US assumed an active role to support PPPs. Increased NGO advocacy (for example, MSF, France) and influence pushed public health problems into international health and international policy agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0049085713493044">Reich, 2002</xref>). The period post-1990s witnessed the formation of such global alliances as partnerships between international organisations, philanthropic groups, private firms, national governments, NGOs and public funded organisations. Though there are several Global Public Private Partnerships (GPPPs) that have emerged to achieve equity in all spheres of health (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0049085713493044">Table 1</xref>), the current article focuses on GPPPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0049085713493044">Table 2</xref>) and PPPs in vaccines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0049085713493044">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Out of four GPPPs listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0049085713493044">Table 2</xref>, except GAVI, all the PPPs are for product development and PATH is a common partner in all of them except in IAVI. PATH announced its recent partnership with IAVI in August, 2012 for selecting malaria vaccine candidates that are developed through MVI. A Meningitis A vaccine that was developed specifically for Africa in October, 2011 through PPP was a successful example of PPP in new product development, completed Phase 3 trials and is undergoing additional testing at present. However, once the product is launched in the market, how the real issues of proprietary rights are shared among partners would determine the strength and sustenance of PPPs. In contrast to Meningitis vaccine initiative, AIDs vaccine development through IAVI yielded very low efficacy vaccine candidates in clinical trials. Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) is also one of PATH’s initiatives to develop vaccines against malaria for developing countries. MVI typically partners with various stakeholders as and when required for product development (vaccines against malaria), though high protection efficacy vaccine has not yet been developed so far. The malaria causing pathogen is so complicated that it is a challenge to make an efficient vaccine against malaria. The success of a safe and effective vaccine development has direct relationship with the nature and epidemiology of disease causing pathogen. This is evident from the fact that it is difficult to make safe and immunogenic vaccines against malaria and AIDS whereas vaccines against Smallpox, DPT, Hepatitis B, etc., were highly protective.</p>
<p>GAVI is one of the major GPPP involving several multiple partners, and it is unique in the sense that this GPPP was not meant for product (vaccine) development but for ‘vaccine introduction’ in poor countries. To put emergence of GAVI in context, PPPs were conceived as a means to access drugs and vaccines and were actively promoted in late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0049085713493044">Harrison, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0049085713493044">Reich 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0049085713493044">Smith 2000</xref>). Vaccines are seen as magic bullets that prevent diseases in one shot. The vaccines which were already under EPI are not expensive and are accessible to all countries. However, there was a concern that the improved and new vaccines that are available in the west are not available in developing and poor countries due to their high price. The champions of vaccine felt that the means to access new vaccines is through tiered pricing and through PPPs.</p>
<p>Initially, GPPPs in vaccines were meant to develop new vaccines through Child Vaccine Initiative (CVI) for the poor countries. However, this effort could not be sustained as evidenced by the death of CVI despite the efforts of prominent actors to forge PPPs for the development of new vaccines for the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0049085713493044">Muraskin, 2002</xref>). Then the concept of access to vaccines in poor countries became the focus of purpose of GPPPs like GAVI whose main objective is to ‘introduce’ new expensive vaccines in those countries where vaccines are not affordable and cannot be accessed. GAVI is interested in introducing only new vaccines and preferably in combinations. It calls these new vaccines as ‘underutilised’ vaccines, though this term is contestable in the context of need based approach and its meaning varies in different country contexts. For instance, the oral polio vaccine (OPV) has not worked in the polio endemic states of India. But can OPV be called an underutilised vaccine in this context? Often, the ineffectual results are blamed on the lack of OPV coverage in these areas without realising the obvious need for generating unequivocal evidence by conducting post vaccination studies to test protection achieved after immunisation. Critiques point out that the technocentric approach of Global Polio Eradication Initiative disregarded the epidemiological features of Polio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049085713493044">Bajpai &amp; Saraya, 2012b</xref>).</p>
<p>GAVI claims that so far it has helped the introduction of Hib in 65 countries, Pneumococcal vaccine in 16 and rotavirus vaccine in 6 countries, out of 74 GAVI eligible countries and averted 55 million future deaths due to Hib, measles, hepatitis B, rotavirus and pneumococcal infections (<uri>www.gavi.org</uri>). It also monitors global rate of coverage and access of new vaccines. In their eagerness to promote vaccine introduction in poor countries to achieve equity in accessing vaccines, GAVI missed the important point that all vaccines are not suitable to all populations in the same manner. This assumption that ‘all vaccines are suitable to all population alike’ distorts the national vaccine choices and needs.</p>
<p>The concept of ‘need’ for a vaccine based on scientific evidence from local regions gets distorted and the use of vaccine in isolation undermines the power of other preventive and public health measures in overall disease management strategy. GAVI’s tendency to push new vaccines in poor countries irrespective of their need, safety and efficacy of vaccines based on local epidemiological evidence was criticised by experts and feared that it would push countries into debt trap by enforcing advance market commitments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0049085713493044">Puliyel, 2011</xref>). GAVI’s unsustainable financial model has also been criticised by an Oxfam–MSF report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0049085713493044">Wilson &amp; Jones, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Though GAVI presents itself as a consortium that provides service to the poor nations, it influences and interferes with national vaccine priorities and policies. The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation being the major fund provider of GAVI also tend to influence local governments through GAVI. It is pointed that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation being the largest contributor to vaccination programmes of GAVI has substantial business interests in at least nine pharmaceutical majors whose representative sits on the Board of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. That the Foundation exercises considerable influence over India’s health policies is evident from the fact that it sponsored the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health which held the protection of intellectual property as crucial to investment in drug development and influenced the report prepared by Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations that recommended the setting up of world class schools of public health in India. Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI; a PPP) was set up soon thereafter and the Gates Foundation has intimate association with PHFI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0049085713493044">Sathyamala, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>It is believed that PPP would improve equity, efficiency, accountability, quality and accessibility of entire health system. The way PPPs developed in the west is different from those in the developing countries. In India, PPPs are being imposed as an economic reforms measure irrespective of its socio-economic reality while it is acknowledged that success or a failure of a PPP for specific purpose varies from case to case. PPPs in vaccines in India show that they are predominantly for conducting clinical trials (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0049085713493044">Table 3</xref>). It is pointed out by critics that clinical trials are less expensive and much easier to conduct in India as compared to western countries because India offers cheap manpower and Contract Research Organisations (CROs) with poor regulatory structure. Clinical trial participants are often reduced to guinea pigs with no law that provides any compensation or treatment in case of any mishap during the trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0049085713493044">Nundy &amp; Gulhati, 2005</xref>). The controversy over HPV vaccine trials where four girls died during the trial raised similar ethical concerns on informed consent, trial injury compensation, follow-up and record-keeping on trail participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0049085713493044">Sarojini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0049085713493044">Sengupta et al., 2011</xref>). This controversy brought a whole lot of issues to the forefront such as the causes of cervical cancer, inability of HPV vaccine to reduce all causes of cervical cancer, and the need for regular screening in spite of HPV vaccine etc. HPV vaccine trials in India were a PPP between Merck and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to conduct clinical trials and to test feasibility of HPV vaccine introduction in Indian population. This PPP certainly did not benefit the women on whom the trials were conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0049085713493044">Sarojini et al., 2010</xref>) but brought awareness in the society by highlighting a whole lot of contentious issues in the academia as well as the popular media.</p>
<p>AIDS vaccine trials, which are again a PPP between ICMR, IAVI and a private company, Targeted Genetics in India, also created a controversy and brought to fore ethical and regulatory issues and the fact that the safety of trial participants was not ensured. Critics pointed out that India conducted Phase II clinical trials of the tgAAC09 vaccine against AIDS without conducting Phase I trials. The Phase II trials in India were conducted just two weeks prior to the announcement of Targeted Genetics that the Phase I trials conducted in Belgium proved that the AIDS vaccine tgAAC09 did not elicit significant immune response in trial participants. Since Target Genetics was also involved in conducting clinical trials in India, it raised scepticism about the sharing of the Belgium trial results with the Indian partners. Questions were raised about whether the Indian partners studied any preliminary trial data of the Belgium trials before launching Phase II trials and why Phase I trials were not conducted in India in the first place. Critics felt that this apparent lack of communication raises questions on the nature of partnerships between Indian and overseas partners (<uri>http://www.infochangeindia.org/hiv-aids/research/aids-vaccine-trials-in-india-ethical-benchmarks-and-unanswered-questions.html</uri>).</p>
<p>Unlike the above examples, indigenous development of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis b-DTP vaccine was a successful PPP between Shantha Biotech Ltd and the Technology Development Board (TDB) of the Department of Science and Technology under the Ministry of S&amp;T, where TDB provided financial support to the private company. However, Shantha Biotechnics Ltd, the most pampered private company by the Indian government as a model for home grown, government-supported private enterprise, has now been taken over by the French multinational company Institut Merieux and is being eyed by another MNC GlaxoSmithKline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0049085713493044">Madhavi, 2009a</xref>), indicating that private sector cannot be a reliable/dependable partner to meet national vaccine requirements for stable affordable vaccine supply.</p>
<p>The above examples of access to vaccines through PPP in India reveal that vaccine development and vaccine clinical trials cannot deliver public health benefits in isolation without addressing ethical, regulatory and governance issues. Moreover, before entering into any PPP, the feasibility and health benefits that may accrue to local populations should be assessed for a vaccine to be developed. For a vaccine to be tested the basis should decidedly be local epidemiological evidence and the exercise should be in relation to prevailing diseases in the country. It must be imperative that PPPs ensure safety and vaccine injury compensation to trial participants while conducting clinical trials.</p>
<p>The experience of vaccine PPPs in India illustrates that public money is being spent for private profiteering without addressing issues of ‘need’ and without ensuring vaccine benefits. Yet, the Union Health ministry announced the construction of a vaccine park, a PPP model in Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu, at a time when three crucial vaccine PSUs were closed down in January, 2008 as they were alleged to be non WHO–cGMP complaint at that time. Another PSU, the Hindustan Health Care Limited (HHCL, earlier Hindustan Latex Ltd), is in charge of the upcoming vaccine park by drawing inspiration from Ernst &amp; Young analysis of vaccine business in India. Despite criticism from the civil society organisations, the health ministry closed its own PSUs while, around the same time, allotting ₹150 crores for setting up the vaccine park. Such policy measures have led to acute shortage of EPI vaccines as the private sector, despite having been supported by the public exchequer, refused to meet the shortages without increasing vaccine prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0049085713493044">Madhavi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0049085713493044">Ramachandran, 2008</xref>). It is also interesting to note that HHCL is also planning to access technologies from the existing PSUs for primary vaccine production in the vaccine park, while new vaccine production is envisaged through PPPs. This has led to fears that this vaccine Park is meant for marketing and distributing new vaccines and their combinations produced by multinational companies after exercising the simple expedient of repackaging from the bulk. This vaccine park thus looks like it will be a bottling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0049085713493044">Ramachandran, 2008</xref>) and cocktail factory of vaccines, where DPT may be procured from vaccine PSUs while the private sector may add new vaccines to make pentavalent (DTP–Hepatitis B–Hib) and tetravalent vaccines (DTP–Hepatitis B). This is a reality unfolding as the Union Cabinet has approved ₹594 crore for the vaccine Park and HHCL has indicated that it would be ready in two years.</p>

<title>Epidemiological Evidence from India for New Vaccines</title>
<p>When scientific community is divided on the issue of need for a vaccine and its safety and efficacy in populations, it becomes difficult to make rational choice of vaccines for mass or selective immunisation for a decision maker. Pressure from various stakeholders distorts local vaccination needs of the public unless it is backed by published scientific evidence. Some examples from India are a reflection of the need for an evidence based policy. The protection efficacy of any vaccine against a disease in a population is dependent on the strain specificity of disease-causing pathogen which varies from region to region. A vaccine effective in Philippines need not necessarily be effective in India. Therefore, pathogen strain specificity and vaccine suitability are important issues in bringing down mortality/morbidity against a disease in mass immunisation strategies. Two highly debated Indian examples are highlighted here.</p>
<sec id="section5-0049085713493044">
<title>Rotavirus Vaccine</title>
<p>Scientific evidence for its need and suitability does not exist for rotavirus vaccine in India. Rotaviral strains in India are different from those in other countries/regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049085713493044">Bajpai &amp; Saraya, 2012a</xref>) and new strains are continually emerging through re-assortment between animal and human strains. Natural infection of rotavirus does not provide protection to subsequent infections because of local, continuously evolving strains. However, in Mexico, natural infection does cause protection against subsequent infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0049085713493044">Puliyel &amp; Mathew, 2012</xref>). These regional differences are indicative of local strain variation and prove that one region/country’s experience cannot be extrapolated to other countries. The WHO recommended rotavirus vaccine to its member countries based on studies from Malawi (one of the poorest countries), Nicaragua and in a few developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0049085713493044">Puliyel &amp; Mathew, 2012</xref>). Most often in India the recommendation is based on estimation of disease burden in numbers rather than based on actual number of cases and deaths in India. It was pointed out that the estimated figures of death due to rortavirus diarrhoea in India presumes uniform mortality rate for all causes of diarrhoea and the estimated figures (122,000 to 15,300 deaths) were arrived at by multiplying mean rotavirus case detection rate with case fatality rate of diarrhoea, which wrongly assumes that all diarrhoeal cases are rotaviral diarrhoea cases. No rotaviral efficacy studies were done in India. Bacterial diarrhoea may cause more mortality due to systemic complications and sepsis whereas rotaviral diarrhoea can be managed with simple measures to reduce dehydration. Fifty eight (58) per cent of rotavirus cases are co-infected with other pathogens and attributing all deaths due to rotavirus will be an overestimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0049085713493044">Puliyel &amp; Mathew, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Two studies estimated that rotavirus vaccine is cost-effective in India by putting vaccine price at US$0.15, and US$7, respectively, while the open market price in middle income countries is US$50. Apparently, Brazil negotiated a vaccine price for US$7. Both the studies, by using vaccine efficacy studies from the west have been extrapolated to India as cost-effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0049085713493044">Puliyel &amp; Mathew, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0049085713493044">
<title>Pentavalent Vaccine (DTP–Hepatitis B–Hib)</title>
<p>Much has been debated on the introduction of pentavalent (Hb–Hib–DTP) vaccine and the Indian government is going ahead with its introduction in UIP despite civil society’s resistance and public debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0049085713493044">Lone &amp; Puliyel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0049085713493044">Madhavi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0049085713493044">Madhavi &amp; Raghuram, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0049085713493044">2010b</xref>; Mudur, 2010). In fact, the debate on the introduction of pentavalent vaccine in UIP is a test case for future new and combination vaccine introduction in Indian UIP.</p>
<p>The published epidemiological evidence from very few studies in India indicates that the Hib incidence is very low in the Indian population, around 0.007 per cent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0049085713493044">IBIS, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0049085713493044">Minz et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, evidence from other countries shows that in Hib vaccinated populations, some highly virulent Hib mutant strains are reported to have replaced the native strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0049085713493044">Bruce et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0049085713493044">Lipsitch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0049085713493044">Muhlemann et al., 1996</xref>). Scientific evidence from India indicates that Indian children develop immunity against Hib during infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0049085713493044">Puliyel et al., 2001</xref>) and it raises doubts about whether the mass vaccination against Hib is warranted. However, proponents of pentavalent vaccine and HIb vaccine cite hospital-based studies to show that Hib is responsible for significant proportion of cases of bacterial meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049085713493044">Bajpai &amp; Saraya, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0049085713493044">IBIS, 2002</xref>) and pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049085713493044">Bajpai &amp; Saraya, 2012a</xref>) in children below five years. However, these hospital-based studies cannot be extrapolated to the general population. The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) in India estimated that the Hib disease burden in India is around 2.4 million cases and 72,000 deaths in children less than five years of age, accounting for approximately 4 per cent of all child deaths in India in the year 2000. A particular point of contention was that NTAGI ignored the results of a multi-centric study done by ICMR to establish the prevalence of Hib invasive disease in India, from July 2005 to December 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0049085713493044">Dutta &amp; Puliyel, 2010</xref>). Results of this study did not support NTAGI’s recommendation of including pentavalent Hib vaccine in EPI. Importantly enough, this led to a review of NTAGI’s recommendation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049085713493044">Bajpai &amp; Saraya, 2012b</xref>).</p>
<p>Contrary to NTAGI’s position, the opponents of Hib vaccine have pointed out the results from probe studies done in Asia to show that the vaccine does not reduce the burden of disease appreciably compared to placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0049085713493044">Puliyel et al., 2010</xref>). Reference has been made to the role of GAVI, WHO, USAID, John Hopkins and the Hib Initiative in misleading the people about the efficacy of the vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0049085713493044">Lone and Puliyel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0049085713493044">Puliyel et al., 2010</xref>). There are no well planned efficacy or cost-effectiveness studies from India yet to support or refute the efficacy of the vaccine. Expert opinions to the effect that ‘the lack of local surveillance data should not delay the introduction of the vaccine especially in countries where regional evidence indicates a high burden of disease’, that is being handed down by WHO, have served as a <italic>fait accompli</italic> for advisory groups like NTAGI while making their own recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049085713493044">Bajpai &amp; Saraya, 2012b</xref>).</p>
<p>There are three most contentious issues on combination vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0049085713493044">Madhavi, 2006</xref>) that have not been answered by any international agency or by companies that invented them. They need attention of policy-makers and readers in the interest of national sovereignty and health security.</p>
<p>First, why is that every combination vaccine is a product of a combination of a UIP vaccine and a non-UIP vaccine? Is it because lack of demand–pull for individual new vaccines (for example, Hepatitis B, Hib) is sought to be covered up by the UIP vaccines that enjoy higher legitimacy? Virtually all combinations are a means by which new vaccines are gaining a back-door entry through the captive UIP market by riding piggyback on UIP vaccines such as DTP, measles, IPV, OPV, etc. If a new vaccine can stand on its own merits (especially epidemiological merit), why does it need a piggyback ride?</p>
<p>Second, if a combination vaccine is nothing more than a cocktail then why does the price multiply? Is pricing of a combination vaccine a method of value addition or a means of cost recovery? If there is a qualitative difference in the technology, one can consider the legitimacy of recovering a cost of delivering it. However, combination vaccines are basically cocktail vaccines that are mixed in a vial and its price is much higher than the individual counterparts while it is expected that it can save costs of packaging, distribution, logistics and marketing. In that case, combination vaccine should be cheaper than all the individual vaccines combined. However its high price compared to total price of all individual vaccines indicates that the combination is made for the value addition but not for the benefit of the public.</p>
<p>As the patents on individual vaccines expire, combination of vaccines becomes a means to acquire new Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) advantage. Are combinations IPR gimmicks or marketing gimmicks that give no additional health benefits than their individual components? Are combination vaccines driven by the same motives as drug formulations? When two individual drugs expire as product patents, combining makes them a new formulation which gives its own IPR advantages. For example both Ibuprofen and Paracetamol are anti-inflammatory. When both are combined, it becomes a new formulation known as Combiflam but sells at much higher price than the individual components. It is well-known among pharma critics that formulations are driven by business motives, which is why majority of irrational drugs are actually formulations. One would like to ask whether vaccines are also joining the ranks of irrational drug formulations?</p>
<p>Third, do benefits of combination vaccines add up? Or is it only in terms of the number of injections reduced? Scientific literature show that in general, the safety and efficacy aspects of combination vaccines are not proven beyond doubt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0049085713493044">Beeching et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049085713493044">Beri &amp; Ojha, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0049085713493044">Comenge &amp; Girard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0049085713493044">Girard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0049085713493044">Vesikari et al, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0049085713493044">WHO 2012</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0049085713493044">Klein et al., 2010</xref>), and it is reported that they are less protective when compared to their individual components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049085713493044">AAP, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0049085713493044">Buttery et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0049085713493044">FDA, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0049085713493044">Greenberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0049085713493044">Kalies et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0049085713493044">White et al., 1997</xref>).

<title>The Need for an Evidence-based Policy</title>
<p>The situation analysis of vaccines in India indicates that market forces and international organisations are distorting national vaccine needs by extrapolating other country experiences, overstating disease burden for vaccine-preventable diseases and pushing new vaccine into UIP without cost–benefit analysis. Lack of reliable surveillance data benefits private companies. Consumers are confused and unaware of merits and demerits of new vaccines. This underscores the need for an evidence-based national vaccine policy for optimum utilisation of vaccines in public health. A draft paper on national vaccine policy was prepared by experts from different disciplines that was published in IJMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0049085713493044">Madhavi et al., 2010</xref>). Two Public Interest Litigations on vaccine PSUs and pentavalent vaccines by civil society compelled the Indian government to draft a national vaccine policy in 2011. However, this policy document was an eye-wash and it actually endorses the current illegitimate practices of vaccine promotion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0049085713493044">
<title>Critique of the Health Ministry’s National Vaccine Policy</title>
<p>The current national vaccine policy (April 2011) uploaded in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) website in July 2011 completely ignored a draft document for evidence-based national vaccine policy that emerged in June 2009 through an interdisciplinary workshop (Co-organised by ICMR and NISTDS) of scientists, doctors, health professionals, lawyers and activists. This document was submitted to the government for consideration and was also published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0049085713493044">Madhavi et al., 2010</xref>), which was well received with no evidence of any credible critique of it so far. Some points to be noted are:
<list id="list1-0049085713493044" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The policy of MOHFW (2011) does not provide an uncompromising scientific basis on which a vaccine can be introduced in Indian UIP and does not commit itself only to need-based and evidence-based vaccination.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In its eagerness to push vaccines, this policy completely missed the very idea of selective immunisation and implies that all immunisation is universal.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The government policy pays lip service to several important issues such as criteria for new vaccine introduction into UIP, including the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, strengthening the surveillance of Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPD) and Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI), operational efficiency, etc. But the fact that these criteria are not mandatory may not ensure the objective decision-making.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It concentrates more on supply-side factors, PPPs, innovative (read speculative) financing, global fund (read advance market commitments to further MNC pharma businesses), etc. The MSF–Oxfam report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0049085713493044">Wilson &amp; Jones, 2010</xref>) points out that the global financing model of Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) that funds vaccine introduction in countries is also unsustainable as it gets its funding from the International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFI) and is based on the promise of future funding from donor countries, raising money in the meantime by issuing bonds to international capital markets which themselves operate in ways no less speculative than the American banks that triggered off the world recession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0049085713493044">Madhavi &amp; Raghuram, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0049085713493044">2010b</xref>). Such policies are not only out of tune with national health security needs, but are also out of sync with the times that we live in; the yearning for health reforms in the US is a pointer to the incongruity of this policy framework. Clearly, this vaccine policy is not designed to enhance national public capacity for public immunisation programmes but to justify spending public money on privately produced vaccines in the name of protection from diseases whose incidence figures and public health statistics are dubious and industry-manufactured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0049085713493044">Madhavi &amp; Raghuram, 2012</xref>). Moreover, advance market commitments to global financing schemes directly impinge on our sovereignty in subsequent decisions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The government policy justifies the introduction of dubious, new combination vaccines (Section 5.2 of MOHFW policy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0049085713493044">GoI, 2011</xref>) in terms of the number of injections reduced and savings on logistics, while conveniently ignoring the fact that the cost of the combination vaccine multiplies manifold with each vaccine added. Most combination vaccines are just expensive cocktails with no net health benefit than their individual components other than the patenting, pricing and marketing advantages they offer to the company that makes them.</p></list-item>
</list></p>

<sec id="section9-0049085713493044">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is clear from above trends that the push for new vaccines is aggressive through various means: (a) advance market commitments; (b) setting international agendas; (c) through PPPs; (d) through national governments; (e) through mass immunisation programmes; (f) through IPR regimes especially in large countries like India, China and Brazil as economies of scale determines the vaccine price and profits. The pressure to introduce new vaccines into UIPs is with the purpose of creating everlasting markets for all new vaccines. Even the deliberate politics of language is selling a vaccine by the disease rather than by the pathogen against which the vaccine is designed. For instance, the pneumococcal vaccine is called anti-pneumonia, though pneumonia is also caused by Hib and other pathogens. Similarly, the anti-rotaviral vaccine is called the anti-diarrhoea vaccine, which it is not. In fact an anti-diarrhoeal vaccine should be the one that protects against all causes of diarrhoea that is prepared with all ant diarrhoeal antigens on a single epitome. In other words, there is a rationality crisis for combination vaccines and therefore legitimacy crisis and it becomes contentious. The aggressive marketing of new vaccines is also crisis of financial speculation as it was reported in the Oxfam–MSF report. One wonders why supply push is becoming so desperate.</p>
<p>The cost of pentavalent vaccines in the US can only be brought down if it is adopted in the UIP of large countries like India, China and Brazil. There is industry compulsion of economies of scale and the tendency to treat expansion of biopharma business as the best escape route from the drug-discovery deadlock in curative and synthetic medicine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0049085713493044">Table 4</xref>). Since 2005, only 11 molecules under product patent were launched in the Indian market. Even loans and aid as marketing tools have to depend on advance market commitments by GAVI, government guarantees on vaccines, funding commitments from donors and speculative loans from capital markets adoption. Pentavalent vaccine is an illustration that commercial success of any new vaccine anywhere in the world depends on economies of scale which, in turn, depends on its universal adoption in large countries. That means even if rest of the world adopts a particular vaccine, it is still not sufficient for the company unless it is pushed into economies of scale. This is a circular profit model where any break in this link would collapse the entire structure, that is, if GAVI’s aid or the World Bank loans are the inducement for adopting such vaccines in the absence of epidemiological evidence and if GAVI’s own funds depend on loans raised by IFFI which, in turn, depend on the policy commitment of large countries, there can be no break in this chain. This raises the critical question about whether vaccines are driving the speculative biopharma boom as the best insurance against synthetic pharma doom. The lack of evidence-based vaccine policy in most countries of the World driving the speculative biopharma boom seems to be the best escape route from the impending doom in synthetic drug discovery. The slogan—‘prevention is better than cure’—is more true today for the pharma industry’s own health than for the health of people and nations.</p>
