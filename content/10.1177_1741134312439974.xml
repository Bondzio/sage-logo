<abstract>
<p>The pharmaceutical market in the Middle East is valued at more than $9.4b and is expected to grow over at a rate of 10% annually. Although there continues to be unrest in the region and around the world, both economically and politically, the Middle East has seen a shift and the pharmaceutical market is becoming more attractive. These countries are traditionally high importers of originator brands and branded generic drugs. Although originator drugs have previously held most of the market, new policies that favor generics are being implemented in the region. The pharmaceutical market ranges quite a bit within the various countries in the Middle East, Bahrain remains the smallest market with Saudi Arabia being the largest due to a growing population and new westernized lifestyle. Policy makers in the region should continue to encourage new players by continuing to propose new policies that allow for continued growth</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741134312439974" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Globally generic manufacturers are getting more innovative moving toward originators and originators are moving toward generics. Regulatory bodies are putting pressure on prices, which will leave few big players. These big players will then control prices which is not the goal. The Middle East has a somewhat unique branded-generics platform, it provides sustainability to affordability. If generics are all about affordable medicine, what is the use if it cannot be sustained?</p>
<p>Publicly funded health systems are under increased pressure to reduce rising drug budgets following the global economic downturn. Governments are seeking to restore fiscal balance by shifting more costs to patients and/or private health insurance.</p>
<p>As healthcare costs can account for up to 15% of GDP and expenditure on prescription drugs continues to grow, generic manufacturers are in the attractive position of being able to fill an increasingly critical need: effective products that are advantageously priced.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741134312439974"><title>Facts about the market</title>
<p>Macro-environmental conditions, in spite of recent political unrest, economic, social, and demographic changes are making the pharmaceutical markets in the Middle East region more attractive. Overall, the Middle East’s pharmaceutical market is valued at more than $9.4b and is expected to grow at a healthy 10% annually.</p>
<p>There are more than 120 pharmaceutical manufacturers in the Middle East. With the exception of Syria and Iraq, all Middle Eastern countries are high importers of originator brands and branded generic drugs. Saudi Arabia, as the richest regional market, has embarked on an ambitious hospital building project – growth is partly driven by greater access to generics as the savings from the pharma bill will contribute to the expenses of operating the new hospitals. Local manufacturing capabilities are constrained to generics or under license from originators and new drug research is very limited.</p>
<p>Middle East healthcare development is shifting toward privatization; the populations have different levels of expectations in each national healthcare system. The healthcare system in Jordan, for instance, is in a transitory phase, characterized by progress toward privatization. While access to free healthcare exists, private services are appearing as a result of the decline in the standard of public sector care and limited capacity. The ministry of health in Jordan has contracts with multiple private hospitals to treat patients covered by the national insurance. This type of environment is conducive to healthy growth of branded generics as the prices of medicine are restricted to the limitation of either government or private insurers trying to control the rising healthcare costs.</p>
<p>International companies recognize the value of increasing pharmaceutical demand and the potential of the Middle East pharmaceutical markets. This is evident by some multinationals having either manufacturing facilities, under license contract, and/or strong local presence.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1741134312439974"><title>Market size, share of generics, and per capita spending</title>
<p>In 2010, originators drugs dominated most Middle East markets, with generic drugs trailing well behind. However, the market share of patented drugs is expected to erode further in this decade as more price cuts are expected and more generic-friendly policies enacted. The following table shows the total market size by country and also the value of generics sales.</p>
<p>Bahrain is the smallest market in the region with annual pharma sales in 2010 of US$118 million and is the only country with no local production. The Saudi pharmaceutical market is the largest in the Middle East. The growing population and its increasingly westernized lifestyle have driven up the level of chronic diseases in the Kingdom. This, alongside the increased wealth of the nation, encourages more per capita spending on medicine.</p>
<p>Jordan exports 80% of its production, making it the only country in the region with a positive trade balance in medicine. Although UAE has a mature health care system, it has the highest priced market for pharmaceuticals.

<p>The vast majority of Middle East markets are currently provided for by imports. Countries like Syria, Iraq, and Jordan show generic penetration rates of 50–90% largely due to policies adopted by the governments in the case of Syria and Iraq. As for Jordan, being the first country in the region with pharmaceutical manufacturing operations and due to accumulated years of expertise in manufacturing affordable quality medicine and marketing, its export penetration comes as a natural result.</p>
<p>UAE ranks the highest in terms of per capita pharma spending in the Middle East and Yemen has the lowest ranking (see Figure 1). Countries with high per capita spending tend to have more health awareness and better insurance coverage<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741134312439974"/>.
<fig id="fig1-1741134312439974" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Per capita pharma spending by country Pharma sales/Population, Source: JAPM.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741134312439974-fig1.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741134312439974"><title>Growth and challenges</title>
<p>Favorable demographics and increase in life expectancy is shifting the demographic pattern (rising ageing population) and is expected to drive pharmaceutical demand in the Middle East. During next 10 years, the share of population over 65 years is expected to grow from 2.7% to 4% in overall population.</p>
<p>The Middle East population growth has averaged over 2% per annum during 2004-09, while the world population has risen by 1%. Improved healthcare infrastructure and decline in mortality rates boosted this population growth.</p>
<p>High life expectancy and sharp population growth are expected to drive demand for pharmaceuticals in the coming years. Increasing healthcare awareness and growth in per capita income have created higher healthcare demand. The infant mortality rate has significantly declined over the years due to availability of better healthcare facilities and medication. Moreover, governments are launching various national health programs to increase awareness of diseases.</p>
<p>For example, according to the International Diabetes Federation, the UAE ranks second in the world and first in the Middle East region for diabetes prevalence (20%), followed regionally by Saudi Arabia (16.7%), Bahrain (15.2%), Kuwait (14.4%), Syria (10.8%), Iraq (10.2%), Jordan (10.1%), Palestine (8.6%), and Lebanon (7.8%). Moreover, obesity-related and other coronary diseases are rising in the region.</p>
<p>Middle East generic manufacturers, although excited about the growth prospects of 15% compound annual growth rate, are facing few critical challenges. With the exception of Jordan, producers of generics catered to their domestic markets and have not in real terms considered export markets in the region. This shortfall in their initial strategy has kept the marketing ability of these producers limited and allowed generic international producers to take advantage and gain significant market share in key Middle East countries.</p>
<p>In order for Middle East generic manufacturers to maintain their market shares, they would need to increase their capacities through merger &amp; acquisition strategies rather than the green field approach. Furthermore, these regional manufacturers should diversify their product mix and access international markets in order to avoid contending with others on the same pie. The Middle East is largely a branded generics market and with this comes the burden of having to spend significantly on marketing to compete with multinational brands.</p>
<p>Few manufacturers such as Hikmah (Jordan), Tabuk (Saudi Arabia), and Midpharma (Jordan) have followed that 34% of patents expiring by 2014 are injectables. These companies have initiated or completed expansion of injectable production facilities.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741134312439974"><title>Regulatory environment</title>
<p>Ministries of Health of Middle East states are the regulatory authorities for the pharmaceutical sector. They also regulate prices of pharmaceutical products. With the exception of Syria (high domestic production), all Middle East governments are trying to boost domestic drug manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports by encouraging local production and in-licensing from multinationals. Some countries give preferential treatment to local producers reflected in faster registration and placing limitation on imports.</p>
<p>New drug registrations take from 1 year up to 3 years to get approval. Saudi Arabia and Jordan are the only countries with an independent Food &amp; Drug Administration to handle pharmaceutical affairs modeled after US FDA. In other countries of the Middle East drug registration is handled by a specialized department in the Ministries of Health. UAE and Saudi Arabia apply the most stringent policies in the region.</p>
<p>Pricing is controlled by health authorities in all Middle East countries. The first generic, as also practiced around the world, is priced at around 20% less than the originator. Prices of generics are also determined by prices in the country of origin and prices in reference countries.</p>
<p>Intellectual property protection is improving in the Middle East and as the following table indicates: six Middle East states have WTO membership, three of them (Bahrain, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia) have indicated and initiated implementation of TRIPS guidelines.

<sec id="sec6-1741134312439974"><title>Outlook 2011-2014</title>
<p>The introduction of obligatory health insurance, initiatives to become more reliant on local pharmaceuticals production and high population growth increase future prospects for both global and regional drug makers. Increased access to generics, innovative new medicines and a rise in chronic diseases are also believed to create increased opportunities of growth in the Middle East pharma market.</p>
<p>It is estimated that US$200 billion worth of drugs will go off patent by 2014. As the Middle East share of the global market is estimated at 1%, the potential new generic sales by 2014 are up to US$900 million. However, the average generic prices in the Middle East is about 50% of the originator, which means US$450 million of new sales are easily created in favor of local and international generic producers operating in the region. More privatization of the industry is encouraged for the few countries that have high government involvement. Besides encouraging increased private sector participation, more governments are also promoting foreign direct investment (FDI) into the healthcare sector, as it is on the priority agenda.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical regulatory climate in the region tended to favor local drug makers. However, with international pressure to instill fair-trade practices, especially in the context of World Trade Organization (WTO), further improves the prospects for improved market dynamics.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741134312439974"><title>Markets in brief</title>
<p>The diverse conditions of Middle East countries economically, politically, business practices, and varying domestic manufacturing capabilities coupled with shifting disease profiles reflect heavily on the market environment for the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>However, in terms of top categories in pharmaceutical consumption, the Middle Eastern countries have similar consumption patterns. The following table shows the top five therapeutic classes in selected countries, the table indicates that while there may be economic and social differences, epidemiology and pharmaceutical consumption are very similar.

</p>
<p>For countries in the Middle East, government pharmaceutical spending covers about 50% of unit’s consumption and the remaining 50% are paid for by private insurance or individuals. In value terms, the ratio of private to government spending is about 60%:40% ± 5%.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1741134312439974"><title>About Syria</title>
<p>Syria produces only limited amounts of active material and the bulk of APIs are imported. Import of drugs that are manufactured in Syria is banned; pharmaceuticals that are not or cannot be produced in the country can be imported.</p>
<p>There are 52 firms producing pharmaceutical products. Syria has the largest number of pharmaceutical companies compared with any other Arab market, even though its domestic market size is smaller than many others. Private capital inflows have increased significantly in the last decade, thanks to the involvement of several major industrial and trading groups in the drug industry. The two largest cities in the country, Aleppo and Damascus, are home to almost all the pharmaceutical manufacturers. ALPHA, Asia, and Oubari are the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741134312439974"><title>About West Bank and Gaza</title>
<p>After more than 25 years of growth (20–30% per annum, according to the Union of Palestinian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers), domestic sales in West Bank/Gaza have stagnated. Due to the growth of inter-and intra-industry, Palestinian pharmaceutical manufacturers have expanded their capacity. Market size, however, has grown only slightly in recent years. This has resulted in producers pursuing a small target market with limited product lines that do not cover certain ailments and diseases.</p>
<p>Currently, there are six major Palestinian companies with approximately $45 million in capital investment, all of which are members of the Union of Palestinian Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers, UPPM. The technology being used by these companies is mostly semiautomatic (80%) and automatic (20%). All of the pharmaceutical production is sold to the local market with zero export sales.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741134312439974"><title>About Lebanon</title>
<p>The total pharmaceutical market in Lebanon was worth US$576m in 2010 and took up 1.4% of GDP, with per-capita spending on medicines at US$140. Key drivers of the overall market growth will be increasing healthcare expenditure, coupled with population and socio-economic expansion and modernization of the healthcare industry. Economic recovery and development will boost private sector coverage, resulting in rising pharmaceutical spending.</p>
<p>Foreign drug companies dominate the market in value terms, although none operate local manufacturing facilities. The remainder of the market is made up of Middle East regional players such as the UAE's Julphar. Nine local companies – including Alfa, Omnipharma, Pharmaline, and Sami Dandan (SADCO) – have minimal market presence, and their contribution to total pharmaceutical sales is limited and basic. Domestic production, which satisfies around 10% of the market, is largely centered on manufacturing products under license from foreign firms.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1741134312439974"><title>About Iraq</title>
<p>The security situation in Iraq is still not conducive enough for a healthy business environment; however, the country has a number of positive fundamental factors that will drive short- and long-term growth. Iraq has huge oil reserves and the money from these natural resources will pay for much of the country’s rebuilding.</p>
<p>In 2009 and 2010, there were large increases in the size of Iraq’s public healthcare budget and in 2011 the Ministry of Health’s announcement stated that the 2011 budget has specifically allocated US$1.5b to the purchasing of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. Government spending on pharmaceuticals increased from US$690 million in 2010 to US$853 million in 2011. Private investment in new modern pharmaceutical plans is also increasing companies like SAFA (Baghdad), PIONEER (Sulaimaneyah), and Modern Drug Industries (Baghdad) have been recently established.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1741134312439974"><title>About Qatar</title>
<p>Qatar is characterized by a strong intellectual property rights environment, urbanization, low regulatory risks, and high per capita spending on branded and imported drugs. The biggest obstacle to adopt greater generic use is the cultural attitude regarding the superiority of branded pharmaceuticals.

</p>
<p>This is one of the matters that the Qatar Supreme Council of Health is trying to tackle by enacting reforms to encourage pharmacies to stock lower priced generic or branded alternative drugs; the previous system of fixed mark-ups rewarded retailers that sold the highest priced patented pharmaceuticals. Retailers could potentially make money selling generic drugs with large mark-ups, which are still cheaper than the branded alternative and therefore satisfy both patients and vendors.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1741134312439974"><title>About Kuwait</title>
<p>Kuwait’s healthcare system is undergoing a period of transition from a primarily state-run public healthcare system to an increased number of public–private partnerships (PPPs), which should deliver both efficiency savings and better healthcare outcomes.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical multinational firms do not have manufacturing facilities in the country and operate through representative offices in the neighboring countries of Saudi Arabia or the UAE. There is only one operating joint venture to manufacture generics in Kuwait still in the early stages of production.

<p>Pharmaceutical prices in Kuwait are one of the highest in the region and the government is implementing restrictions and control over drug pricing and profit levels, as well as reimbursement on high-priced medicines. Due to relative wealth of the population and significant expatriate population in the country, branded and patented drugs are more popular; however, Kuwaiti authorities are encouraging generic use in procurements to control expenditures.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1741134312439974"><title>About Saudi</title>
<p>The Saudi drug market was worth around US$2.86b in 2010, accounting for 29% of pharmaceutical sales in the Middle East region. While pharmaceutical expenditure rose marginally as a component of GDP, it represents a relatively minor 0.6% of the total, suggesting strong potential for growth. In the meantime, imports continue to account for the bulk of total spending, although government support has the potential to stimulate export growth of local firms, as well as the local use of generics.

<p>As a result of the country’s wealth, demand for the latest and most expensive products in the Kingdom is high. Patented drugs are the leading products in the market, with generic drugs accounting for only about 12% by value in 2010. The country possesses an open trading environment with few tariff barriers, although some foreign drug makers complain of a bias toward local producers. Saudi Arabia’s assent to the WTO in December 2005 improved the country’s IP regime. However, the implementation of new patent laws has alienated many international drug makers, which are concerned that their products do not get adequate protection.</p>
<p>According to the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC), there are 27 pharmaceutical manufacturing companies registered in Saudi Arabia. Most of these are generic drug manufacturers, including SPIMACO, TABUK, Al Jazeera, SAJA, and Riyadh Pharma. Local manufacturers rely on the United States and Europe for raw materials, although India and China should present growing options from which to source.</p>
<p>A multinational presence is also extensive in the Saudi market, although their activity is through local agents and distributors. The complex nature of the domestic regulatory system has meant that few multinationals have considered establishing a manufacturing base in the country.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1741134312439974"><title>About Bahrain</title>
<p>Bahrain has estimated the pharmaceutical market size at US$118m in 2010. Growth is limited by the small population base of the country; it would be driven by increased per capita consumption, population growth, and growing importing costs.</p>
<p>Private players command almost 50% share in market spending. There are ongoing developments in the healthcare sector by neighboring countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for development of the pharmaceutical sector in Bahrain.</p>
<p>Around 60% of the Bahraini population is overweight and the country has high diabetes incidence rate. These are the key growth drivers for its pharmaceuticals sector. Bahrain has a limited manufacturing base and imports almost all of its branded pharmaceutical products, accounting for nearly 96%, with the help of various free trade agreements. Low pharmaceutical spending in Bahrain offers little attraction to foreign drug makers for establishing manufacturing sites in the country.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec16-1741134312439974"><title>About UAE</title>
<p>The UAE is the second-largest region in the GCC in terms of market share with an estimated market size of US$1.8b in 2010, and it is heavily dependent on imported products for consumption as its economy is characterized by high per capita income and promotes affluent living.</p>
<p>Europe exports about 60% of UAE drugs and the remaining share is divided among western and Arab manufacturers. The prices for generic drugs are higher in the UAE compared with other countries as they involve significant marketing cost. Although he pharmaceutical sector is considered as a stable sector in the country with two manufacturing companies, little attention is paid to the investment in R&amp;D. The government has imposed a ban on re-exports and taken a multilateral approach for detection and seizure of fake drugs being funneled into the region.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec17-1741134312439974"><title>About Oman</title>
<p>Oman is characterized by a small population base and strict drug price control. It is estimated to have a pharmaceutical market size of US$152m in 2010. Wealthy and ageing population, fondness for imported and branded products, and regulated intellectual property environment are key factors for growth in the sector.</p>
<p>The country has low per capita healthcare expenditure among the countries in the region and has limited manufacturing facilities. The country expects to boost domestic generic drug production as it secured FDA approval for the export of generic antibiotics in the well-priced US market, which is already approved for countries such as Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Mandatory insurance for employees is yet to be implemented by the Government in the near future.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec18-1741134312439974"><title>About Yemen</title>
<p>Yemen is the least developed country in terms of healthcare among all Middle East countries, and although there are two pharmaceutical manufacturing companies, it imports 95% of its drug requirements.</p>
<p>The size of the pharma market in Yemen is over US$500m and has an average growth rate around 20% if supply and imports are smooth. Historically, when there is political turmoil, import and supply of drugs is interrupted and drugs are smuggled into the market and often sold on the black market.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec19-1741134312439974"><title>Jordan a pharma destination</title>
<p>Joint ventures and licensing deals with Jordanian pharmaceutical manufacturing companies will open up the gates to the Middle East</p>
<p>Uniquely positioned in the region, Jordan’s pharmaceutical industry exports reach more than 60 countries worldwide, with more than 80 patents registered in Europe, the United States, and Japan. Exports in 2010 have reached US$620m.</p>
<p>Jordan’s geographical location in the region and availability of qualified human resources makes it an attractive low-cost regional manufacturing/sales hub. Clinical trial testing and bioequivalence studies are 30% less in cost than Europe and USA.</p>
<p>Market-driven legislations and strict adherence to Intellectual property laws and enforcement are hallmarks respected by both policy makers and industry.</p>
<p>Jordan is the only country in the region that has the Bolar provision giving local manufacturers first in advantage.</p>
<p>Jordan has 11 universities with medical subjects, 8 pharmacy colleges, 7 clinical research organizations (CROs).</p>
<p>In the last two decades, Jordan promoted medical tourism and developed world class medical infrastructure with associated accommodation and transportation services: Jordan is the region’s medical treatment hub (ranked no.1 as medical tourism destination according to World Bank).

<sec id="sec21-1741134312439974"><title>Smaller countries to form strategic export markets</title>
<p>Countries such as Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait, which have limited population, are striving to secure strategic trade partners for low cost generic drugs distribution. This serves as an alternative to setting-up of manufacturing bases which multinational drug makers do not find attractive enough due to market size.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec22-1741134312439974"><title>Centralized buying as the engine for generic substitution</title>
<p>To improve health care facilities and medical distribution, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia established The National Company for Unified Purchase of Medicines &amp; Medical Appliances in 2007 for purchasing, storing, and distributing medicines and medical appliances in the country. The new wholesaler would help minimize the current high prices given the competition with drug importers that service the public sector. This approach has been long practiced by Syria and Iraq through state-established companies.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec23-1741134312439974"><title>Potential for R&amp;D sector in the region</title>
<p>As the pharmaceutical sector in the Middle East region matures, R&amp;D spending on the sector is set to grow. Since generics constitute a small fragment of the pharmaceuticals sector, R&amp;D spending has been low. However, going forward, Middle East countries are not only increasing their R&amp;D spending on generics, also they need to encourage novel drugs and delivery systems.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec24-1741134312439974"><title>Pharmaceuticals industry and the role of regulators</title>
<p>Middle East policy makers need to encourage new players to:
<list id="list2-1741134312439974" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Set-up new generic facilities through joint ventures and also motivate in-licensing and provide free property leases and tax breaks.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Simplify regulations, upgrade and expand healthcare infrastructure (hospitals, clinics, R&amp;D centers etc.).</p></list-item>
