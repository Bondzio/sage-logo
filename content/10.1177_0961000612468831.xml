<p>Bethan Ruddock, co-chair of the Special Libraries Association Early Career Committee (amongst other roles), is well qualified to provide advice and guidance on those important post-qualifying steps towards a professional career. That the employment sector for information professionals has changed over the course of the last 20 years is readily apparent; the newspapers and professional journals regularly contain news and advertisements for jobs that rarely mention the word ‘library’ but focus, instead, on the essence of our discipline: the supply and flow of information.</p>
<p><italic>The New Professional’s Toolkit</italic> is aimed at the entrant to the profession; it will also be extremely useful to anyone contemplating a career change that will take them outside the ‘library’ context and into circumstances where one is defined more by a community that is to be served. A different set of skills is needed, in many cases, or the refinement of skills and knowledge already imparted through a professional education. Ruddock has considered carefully what issues are likely to confront the novice and is careful to encourage and to acknowledge the difficulties that may occur. Thus, when explaining that teaching and training are frequently-used skills she notes that:<disp-quote>
<p>There is no doubt that being the focus of attention can be disconcerting, especially when you are trying to impart important information, and want to do the best you can for your subject and listeners. There is nothing wrong with being nervous! (p. 16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What follows is practical advice on reducing the effects of nervousness by adequate preparation and the exercise of forethought – in this respect, supplied by a case study presented by her colleague, Lisa Jenkins. This exemplifies the pattern of the book: practical points are illustrated through case studies written by a variety of authors from the United Kingdom and overseas. In choosing this approach, Ruddock has ensured that the text remains grounded in reality and the kind of issues that are likely to be of concern.</p>
<p>The book opens with a chapter on project management: not the most obvious choice but the point is made that this is most likely going to be the first activity in which one is involved. The skills that are explored are applicable to a one-person occupation as well as working within a team or in managing a team. Some guidance on tools for project management is provided – and there are suggestions of sources to consult for further guidance. Chapter 2 develops the theme of teaching, training and communicating, outlined earlier, and includes several case studies, including one by Rosie Jones on game playing as a means of encouraging involvement. There are also some practical tips on presentation and writing. This section is somewhat brief, however and, in a revised edition, could be considerably extended, if only because it might steer people away from over-reliance on presentation management software, such as PowerPoint. Knowing, too, the importance of planning ahead for possible time-management problems when presenting at a conference would reduce embarrassment and audience confusion – or does this only happen in South Africa?</p>
<p>The next chapter covers how to measure success in meeting user needs, including an introduction to how to measure the impact of a library. Apart from some excellent advice from David Streatfield, the chapter includes a review of tools (some very expensive) and some guidance on how to do-it-yourself, culminating in some guidance on other sources to consult. This leads on to a chapter on marketing and engaging with stakeholders. Ruddock provides an accessible introduction to marketing and the development of a marketing plan, illustrated with case studies by Michael Stead of the Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust, and Alison Circle, Marketing Director for Columbus Metropolitan Library, whilst Reece Dano of the Artefact Group, Seattle, considers the model of embedded librarianship. Each chapter of the book ends with an ‘Over to you …’ section that is intended to be thought provoking: in the case of this chapter, it includes the ‘acid test’: ‘Is your job intimately bound up in a physical space?’, which represents the theme of the book overall.</p>
<p>Although Chapter 5, ‘Using technologies’ serves to collect together useful points and ideas it is the weakest section of the book: one would expect a novice, fresh from professional education, to be more than well aware of most of the issues raised. There is certainly a place to discuss technology in a book of this type but the space might more usefully have been devoted to considering in more detail <italic>management</italic> strategies for promoting the use of e-resources and the transition into a largely-digital culture. This would also complement Alison Circle’s case study in Chapter 4.</p>
<p>Much the same point could be made about Chapter 6, which discusses ‘Getting and staying online’. However, the emphasis is less on technology and more on services and sources, such as the use of social media. The chapter includes three case studies of service to greatly-differing communities of users and underlines the importance of experimentation and the need for tolerance of failure. This chapter might, in a future edition, include some expansion of this point – that in a turbulent environment, progress is often made through a better understanding of mistakes than in the simple celebration of victories.</p>
<p>The ability to raise and manage funds is often overlooked in professional education. Chapter 7, ‘Generating funding and doing more with less’ provides excellent practical advice on sources of funding and how to develop and write a funding proposal. It links naturally to Chapter 8, on ‘Managing money, budgets and budgeting’ and, whilst neither chapter provides much more than an introduction to the topics, they do provide a starting point, including some specimen spreadsheets in the Appendix.</p>
<p>It may seem odd to include a chapter on ‘Information ethics and copyright’ but, Ruddock reminds us that our professional endeavour depends upon the ethical use of information and that, moreover, we will encounter ethical dilemmas. The chapter covers the ethical issues arising from selection and acquisition of materials, their use and the need to educate users. This last includes the sage advice: ‘Keep it positive! People tend to associate copyright with negatives, so focus on what they can do as opposed to what they can’t do’ (p. 149).</p>
<p>The later chapters are more concerned with professional development, the importance of networking and career development. Once again, the advice is practical and focused on <italic>planned</italic> rather than serendipitous development. A brief conclusion and an index end the book.</p>
<p>Would I recommend this text? Yes, because of its stimulating approach, common sense and good examples. The sources listed will certainly provide a good platform for further enquiry and the ideas for development will greatly assist a newly-fledged professional. I would also recommend it to more seasoned practitioners as a means of reviving interest or for getting back into the profession after some time away. Whilst many of the sources are related to the United Kingdom and United States of America, the advice is capable of being used elsewhere and a little research on the topics discussed will soon provide complementary sources suitable for use in other countries. Bethan Ruddock is to be congratulated on a fine piece of work that should continue to have influence for a long period.</p>
