<p>Cameron Macdonald tackles a social problem that has captured America’s imagination recently: the relationship between working mothers and their in-home caregivers. Popular culture has vilified wealthy, stay-at-home mothers, as depicted in the novels <italic>The Nanny Diaries</italic> and <italic>The Help</italic>. Fictional moms neglect their children and mistreat their nannies, concentrating on swanky parties instead of their own children’s welfare—that is, until their children express a preference for the nanny over the mother—then it is “Sayonara Nanny!” These stories, coupled with news reports of inexperienced nannies harming children (Macdonald, chapter 1), provide the context for this book. When I began reading it, I expected to be seized by loathing for selfish mothers and pity for mistreated caregivers. This book was different, but no less satisfying, than I had imagined it would be.</p>
<p>Macdonald begins each chapter with a “prelude,” introducing the reader to the “micropolitics” between “mother-employers” and their in-home caregivers. These beautifully written excerpts portray a world where educated moms in professional careers try to manage their children’s care, even while they are at work. They are women from <italic>my</italic> world and that of my female colleagues who grew up being told by feminist mentors, “You can have it all: career, family, autonomy, and respect!” Macdonald’s mothers are not the heartless villains of fiction; they are real women trying to live the feminist ideal. Her mothers (<italic>N</italic> = 30) are stimulated at work, but their “male-patterned careers” provide no space for mothering. They see themselves as failing at work and home. The ideology of “intensive mothering” exacerbates the pressures on working mothers, who simply cannot measure up to either ideal of perfect mother or perfect worker—indeed, one is at odds with the other, both unattainable.</p>
<p>These mothers recognize that the only way to “have it all” is if someone else does a lot (most) of the unglamorous work of the household. Because few dads have taken up that charge (dads are tellingly absent in this book), moms hire other women—many of whom are also moms—to do that work. The ironies of feminism are revealed: for mothers to succeed in male-patterned careers, they harness the labor of other women. Mother-workers feel a “blanket accountability” to care for their children, even while at work, so they rely on caregivers to act as extensions of themselves. Caregivers (<italic>N</italic> = 50) in this study include American-born and immigrant nannies, as well as young European au pairs. Mother-employers’ use racial stereotypes and “ethnic logics” as indicators of caregivers’ skill sets. Many mothers in this study construct “shadow mothers”: caregivers who do all of the work of the “real” mother, but stay in the background, disappearing when the real mother appears. Some caregivers resist being relegated to the shadows, promoting the idea that they could be “third parents.” However, resistance is risky, as caregivers could lose much-needed employment and references.</p>
<p>Caregivers are torn in many directions: they want to be trusted, valued, and loved. They want their advice to be sought and followed. They care more about social capital, in fact, than they care about actual capital, often to a fault. Caregivers walk fine lines everywhere—they are hired to love and care for children, but this love can threaten the mother, who longs to be central to the family although she is often absent. Basically, the caregiver can get into trouble for doing her job too well. The caregiver must protect the mother’s identity as mommy, even while doing a lot (most) of her duties. At its heart, this book is about two sets of working women who love children. Both groups of women want to be respected as good, qualified workers, and they both want to be free to love children and to have that love be socially valued. They are women battling a social structure that values paid work and devalues carework. Rather than seeing their common enemy in the macropolitics of society, they go head-to-head in the mircropolitics of the household.</p>
<p>Macdonald posits a solution to the tension: a true partnership between mother-employer and caregiver. This rare partnership must be based on trust, autonomy, communication, and shared decision making. Macdonald concludes with the assertion that child care is here to stay. We must find ways for parents and caregivers to “untangle the knot” of caregiving to create an effective balance.</p>
<p>Macdonald does an excellent job of revealing the knot of tangled emotions, power, and gender at the micropolitical level. Her data are rich, and she examines them from myriad compelling angles. I would have liked more discussion of the macropolitical context that frames this analysis. For example, the role of fathers is underexplored. If these women are the products of second-wave feminism, then why do not they make more demands on father care? Also, a critical examination of the structure of paid work could help explain how ostensibly feminist mothers’ find themselves in an antifeminist bind.</p>
