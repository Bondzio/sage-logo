<abstract>
<p>This study explored the teaching and learning in an adult financial literacy education program aimed specifically at Latina single mothers to understand the influence of sociocultural factors in this setting. Informed by critical and Latina feminist sociocultural adult learning perspectives and the transtheoretical model of behavior change, special interest was paid to the pedagogical approaches and the role that ethnicity, gender, and the Latino culture played in the teaching and learning process. Data from educator and learner interviews, class observations, and document analysis revealed three main insights: (a) the program uses a holistic approach to financial education, emphasizing community leadership and creating a cultural community of support for the learners; (b) the pedagogy emphasizes both content and process, emphasizing learner needs to create this supportive community and deliver the financial content; and (c) the promotion of financial behavior change motivates learners to make changes.</p>

<p>As of the summer of 2011, the unemployment rate in the United States is holding steady at 9.2%, up from the 3.8% rate in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741713612460267">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2011</xref>), and home foreclosures have risen 183% in the past 3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741713612460267">Memmott, 2010</xref>). Americans are largely unprepared for major life events such as retirement, college education, and unexpected emergencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741713612460267">Lusardi, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741713612460267">2011</xref>). These disturbing facts accompany reports of historically low savings rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741713612460267">Lusardi, 2008</xref>), high consumer debt, and rising bankruptcy rates. Other countries are experiencing similar strains in their economies, with many in the United Kingdom being unprepared for unexpected “income shocks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741713612460267">Kempson &amp; Atkinson, 2006</xref>, p. 5). Although these difficulties might be in part because of the economic downturn of the past few years, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741713612460267">Princeton Survey Research Associates International (2008)</xref> indicates that there is a lack of understanding of financial systems and the complexity of financial services and products, suggesting low financial literacy levels among American adults and youth, and has led to an increased call for more financial education and responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741713612460267">Ahrens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741713612460267">Fox, Bartholomae, &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Research into financial literacy education has revealed that (a) outcomes of financial education programs are difficult to measure and collect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741713612460267">Lyons, 2005</xref>); (b) workplace financial education programs yield easier measurable outcomes with large numbers of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741713612460267">Loibl &amp; Hira, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0741713612460267">Vitt, Reichbach, Kent, &amp; Siegenthaler, 2005</xref>); (c) attention to the needs of specific learners, including Latinos, is a prominent concern among educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741713612460267">Endres, Chowdhury, &amp; Alam, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0741713612460267">Toussaint-Comeau &amp; Rhine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0741713612460267">Vitt et al., 2000</xref>); and (d) there has been recent interest in ways to change the financial behavior of the learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741713612460267">Hilgert &amp; Hogarth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0741713612460267">Spader, Ratcliffe, Montoya, &amp; Skillern, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Two primary assumptions undergird this movement for and interest in financial literacy education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0741713612460267">Willis, 2008a</xref>). The first assumption is the deficit model from educational theory, which explains that unsuccessful individuals have “alleged internal deficiencies (such as cognitive and/or motivational limitations) or shortcomings socially linked . . . such as familial deficits and dysfunctions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0741713612460267">Valencia, 1997</xref>, p. xi). According to this model, those who are poor and/or do not participate in the mainstream banking systems must have a deficit in knowledge or skills of even the basic concepts surrounding financial matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741713612460267">Lusardi, 2010</xref>). The second assumption, building on the deficit model, is the belief that providing this knowledge results in better financial management and is also tied to personal responsibility for one’s own successes and failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741713612460267">Lonsdale &amp; McCurry, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0741713612460267">Sandlin, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0741713612460267">Valencia (1997)</xref> states, “deficit thinking is tantamount to the process of ‘blaming the victim’” (p. x), which in the financial education setting translates as the learner being responsible for his or her own financial situation. This second assumption also illustrates the contradiction between a knowledge-based versus a more behaviorist, functional approach to financial literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741713612460267">Mandell, 2006</xref>). The behaviorist approach, as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741713612460267">Buckland (2010)</xref> in his study of low-income Canadians, is most prevalent in financial literacy education. Clearly, having knowledge of financial matters is important, but possession of that knowledge alone does not guarantee the best financial decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741713612460267">O’Connell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0741713612460267">Sandlin, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>These assumptions ignore literature from adult education about teaching and learning, literature from psychology about behavior change processes, and knowledge of sociocultural factors that affect learners in every aspect of their lives (e.g., race, gender, language). Numerous studies and conceptual pieces in adult and culturally responsive education inform this perspective, particularly those focusing on literacy and pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741713612460267">Choules, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741713612460267">Freire &amp; Macedo, 1995</xref>). Adult education researchers have also illuminated the importance of the cultural context on teaching and learning, with explorations into the beliefs, social relationships, and social environment of marginalized groups in educational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713612460267">Alfred, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741713612460267">Guy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0741713612460267">Tisdell, 2001</xref>). In addressing adult education literacy instruction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0741713612460267">Sandlin (2005)</xref> also discusses consumer education, which in its present form ignores the “social, political, economic, and cultural meanings of consumption” (p. 166). A few studies have addressed Latino sociocultural issues and literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741713612460267">Prins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0741713612460267">Sparks, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741713612460267">Buckland (2010)</xref>, in addressing low-income populations in Canada specifically, points out that financial literacy varies across socioeconomic groups. However, apart from this study, sociocultural perspectives have been applied to the financial education of adults on few occasions, and on even fewer occasions among learners with Hispanic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Research and literature in general education illustrate the importance of recognizing the context of the lives of Latinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741713612460267">Maestro, Behn-Morawitz, &amp; Kopacz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0741713612460267">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2009</xref>) and placing value on these experiences to combat the struggles for academic and economic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741713612460267">Saenz &amp; Ponjuan, 2009</xref>). Latina feminist literature also informs about the experiences of the Latina woman, including their feelings of living on the borders of life in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713612460267">Anzaldúa, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741713612460267">Ortega, 2004</xref>), struggles for identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741713612460267">Gonzalez &amp; Gandara, 2005</xref>), and the influence of the male-dominated culture that persists in some Latino families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741713612460267">Abalos, 2007</xref>). Within financial literacy, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741713612460267">Marlowe and Atiles (2005)</xref> explores the consumer fraud to which Latino groups might be more vulnerable, because of low-level English skills and low levels of financial literacy. Taking the experiences of Latinos into account during the development of a financial literacy program, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0741713612460267">Spader et al. (2009)</xref> illustrate the possibilities of using the media as a delivery method for financial education. Literature in these areas indicates that myriad factors affect learning in general and that, in financial literacy specifically, education does not necessarily lead to behavior change and that other circumstances in individual lives often affect financial decisions that seem, at first glance, to be unrelated to the decision itself. In light of the gaps in the research into difference, cultural perspectives, and Latinos in adult education and financial education research, <italic>the purpose of this study was to explore the teaching and learning in adult financial literacy education classes targeted for Latina learners, particularly with respect to the sociocultural impact of the learners’ life circumstances</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section1-0741713612460267">
<title>Theoretical Framework in Lightof Key Issues in Financial Education</title>
<p>To explore this purpose effectively, this study exists within the framework of sociocultural perspectives of adult learning theory, including critical and Latina feminist perspectives. Because critical and cultural perspectives emphasize the importance of social change but are not always specific about how change occurs, this study is also informed by the transtheoretical model of behavior change, allowing for a more nuanced view of the potential changes and outcomes resulting from financial education.</p>
<sec id="section2-0741713612460267">
<title>Sociocultural Perspectives on Adult Learning</title>
<p>A sociocultural perspective on adult learning, which includes the mutually influencing cultural, critical, and feminist perspectives, offers a more holistic view of learning than is typically present in the financial literacy education literature. As noted, theorists and researchers in education and adult education acknowledge the importance of giving attention to outside factors in learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741713612460267">Brown, Cervero, &amp; Johnson-Bailey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741713612460267">Nieto &amp; Bode, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741713612460267">Sleeter &amp; Grant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0741713612460267">Sparks, 1998</xref>). An example of sociocultural perspectives applied to adult education research is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713612460267">Alfred’s (2003)</xref> study of Anglophone Caribbean immigrant women, in which the empowering possibilities in recognizing and valuing the “raciocultural identities” of the learners (p. 256) is illustrated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741713612460267">Sealey-Ruiz’s (2007)</xref> work confirms this idea and emphasizes the enhanced learning experiences through embracing the “cultural characteristics” of students’ “race, social status, and linguistic abilities” (p. 58). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741713612460267">Prins (2005)</xref> also determined that traditionally instrumental approaches that focus on skills and productivity “overlook the very social meanings that learners most appreciated” (p. 85). Applied to financial education, this perspective can have a great impact on understanding the worlds in which the learners live, as well as contributing a more complete understanding of their needs, desires, and goals. In addition, sociocultural theory offers financial education a new perspective on the ways in which learners make meaning of their financial experiences in and out of the classroom.</p>
<p>Feminist perspectives, particularly those that are related to the life experiences of Latinos, also informed this study. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713612460267">Gloria Anzaldúa’s (1987)</xref> concept of the “borderlands” contributes to an understanding of Latino culture, suggesting that Latinos in the United States live between Latino culture and White Anglo culture and that Latinas have to further negotiate machismo culture, all of which affects their entire worldview, including their financial reality. Additionally, this study is informed by other critical perspectives in education that encourage questioning of political, economic, and social structures and institutions that exert power over the lives of the people within it and affect not only the power and positionality of the learners. Banks and other financial institutions exert an enormous amount of power, and from a critical perspective, some of the actions of those institutions can be seen as detrimental to the individual, particularly since many negative decisions about neighborhoods and access to financial services occur in low-income and racial/ethnic minority homogeneous communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741713612460267">Lucey, 2004</xref>), while maintaining or increasing the financial institutions’ own power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741713612460267">Williams, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0741713612460267">Willis, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>The possibility that financial education benefits other people or institutions more than the financial education learners themselves has largely been ignored in the financial literacy education literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713612460267">Gross (2005)</xref> argues that this educational movement can actually prevent necessary structural changes from taking place, such as revising the credit scoring system, which penalizes low-income individuals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741713612460267">Williams (2007)</xref> echoes this argument and suggests that the “responsibilization” (p. 226) of consumers that takes place with financial education can be disempowering as it is sold to the public while clearly benefitting institutions. In two articles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0741713612460267">Willis (2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0741713612460267">2008b)</xref> suggests that the reasons for institutional support of unproven financial education programs could be related to the benefits received by the institutions themselves. She states,
<disp-quote>
<p>Because good financial decisions by consumers are less lucrative for many industry players, these firms’ support is likely predicated, if not on a conclusion that financial-literacy programs are ineffective, then on the premise that these programs are less effective than other regulatory policies industry would otherwise face. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0741713612460267">Willis, 2008a</xref>, p. 211)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These types of critical perspectives are increasingly necessary as educators and learners immerse themselves in learning about the financial system and how to function inside these institutional boundaries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0741713612460267">
<title>The Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change</title>
<p>These sociocultural, critical, and feminist perspectives on education all advocate social change, but they are not always clear on how these social structures function at the individual level. Since changes in financial behavior are the objective of financial education, and in recognition of the fact that financial education without behavior change is of seen as having little value to learners, researchers in financial education are beginning to use behavior change research to inform their work, such as the transtheoretical model (TTM) of behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713612460267">Lyons &amp; Neelakantan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0741713612460267">Spader et al., 2009</xref>). Originating in health behavior change, TTM offers a view into the processes individuals must go through to change. There are five stages in the process: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741713612460267">Prochaska &amp; Norcross, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0741713612460267">Spader et al. (2009)</xref> suggest that application of this theory to financial education has the potential to “improve financial education interventions” (p. 77), pinpointing the stage at which learners are most accepting of financial education concepts. Taking their assertion of the benefits to financial education one step further, the present study reflects on the learning processes informed by the stages and incorporates this knowledge into Latino financial education programs.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This research used a qualitative case study design to examine how the Latina educators and learners in the financial education program make meaning from their experiences and to gain information about their interaction with one another and with the world around them, which influences their behavior and motivations related to their financial education. Classes were observed and field notes were taken; in-depth interviews were conducted with the program administrator, educators, and learners; and documents were collected. The semistructured interviews, digitally recorded and lasting from 45 to 90 minutes each, consisted of open-ended questions, designed to get the interviewees to think about their experiences as the learning process progresses in the financial education classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741713612460267">Fontana &amp; Frey, 2008</xref>). The interviews included a variety of question types, such as illustrative and presupposition questions, and were allowed to progress naturally and openly, with little intervention except to keep the interviewees in the general field of education, learning, and culture. I also made a concerted effort to “minimize the imposition of predetermined responses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741713612460267">Patton, 2002</xref>, p. 353). This was a particularly salient issue for me as the interviewer, since my own positionality as a White, working-class, educated woman whose first language in English could strongly influence the responses of the participants, despite my critical perspective on the social, economic, and political structures that influence power exchanges in society. In preparing for and conducting this study, I made every effort to avoid “objectifying the subjectivities of the researched, by assuming authority, and by not questioning” my own position of privilege (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0741713612460267">Villenas, 2010</xref>, p. 346). These interviews combined with the other data to create a holistic picture of what was happening in this setting, including the cultural issues present in the educators’ and learners’ lives that influence what happens in the classroom in an ethnographic-like design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0741713612460267">Stake, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0741713612460267">Yin, 2009</xref>). Since it is unclear from the existing research exactly which factors, of the many potentially influencing factors, are actually having an impact on financial education classes and on the potential for behavior change among learners, this study design facilitated an unveiling of some of those factors.</p>
<sec id="section5-0741713612460267">
<title>Context and Participants</title>
<p>The case was a financial education program in a Midwestern city designed for low-income Latina single mothers, called <italic>Mujeres Fuertes</italic> (strong women), and funded through a charitable organization assisting single, working women. The program, located in a Latino community center in a large Latino neighborhood, has the goal of improving “the lives of women through effective training, inspired leadership, and creative personal growth” and providing “services in career pathways, wealth creation, Latina leadership, and social supports,” as noted in their literature. Combining a financial services organization, a career development organization, and a social services organization, the program is “investing in Latina women; firmly believing in their potential; providing support services; impacting the whole family and community,” and ultimately acting as a model for duplication by other programs. The focus of this study is the financial education and counseling portion of the program, but it is important to note that the program emphasizes the importance of valuing the Latina part of the women’s lives, including conducting all classes entirely in Spanish, even for those learners’ whose second language is Spanish.</p>
<p>The women who attend the program are motivated by a need to improve their lives and the lives of their family members. They recognize that educational opportunities can help them, clearly demonstrating the underlying belief that greater education can lead to greater opportunities and more powerful positions in their lives. The cohort program, funded entirely by the grant, lasts for 3 years: the first year consists of two terms of financial education, life skills, career development, and leadership classes, each term lasting 15 weeks, for a total of 30 weeks of classes; the second and third years are devoted to participants’ educational and career development and work on committees at the community center to develop their leadership skills. When the women come into Mujeres Fuertes, they have the possibly confining options of beginning a new career in customer service or becoming a certified nursing assistant (CNA), licensed practical nurse, or registered nurse. The career classes are designed to be completed in 3 to 4 years, depending on the chosen program of study. Although these choices might seem limited in scope and perhaps as maintaining the service-oriented roles of Latinos and women in the United States, they can be seen as a starting point for these participants albeit within the financial limitations imposed on grant-funded social services. Participants also have the option of taking computer proficiency classes, English as a Second Language classes, and/or high school equivalency (GED) classes, depending on their educational needs, abilities, and goals.</p>
<p>Interview participants from the program were chosen based on their role in the program and their willingness to participate. Therefore, interviews were conducted with the administrator, Marisa, and the two financial educators who worked in the program at the time, Sonya and Marisol (pseudonyms are used for all participants in the study). The administrator and educators self-identified as Latinas, are all educated at the university level in the United States, and have been working with Mujeres Fuertes for a minimum of 1 year. Both Sonya and Marisol have experience working in fields related to financial services, and they were attracted to the jobs at Mujeres Fuertes, despite the low salaries, because of the need for these services in the community. While working there, they have also been able to complete further training and workshops to enhance their financial knowledge. The interview with Marisa focused on, but was not limited to, the program organization, funding, recruiting, goals, outcomes, the role of the program in the lives of the learners and in the community, and the sociocultural factors that affect each of those aspects of the program. Sonya and Marisol were asked about their background, both professional and educational, their decision to work in this particular financial education program, their curricular and pedagogical choices, and their beliefs about the impact of Latino sociocultural factors on the teaching and learning in their classrooms.</p>
<p>To understand the perspectives and experiences of the learners, interviews were also conducted with Latina participants in the program. The women of Mujeres Fuertes are all from a variety of countries, such as Mexico, Colombia, Puerto Rico, and the United States. The participants are all single mothers and bilingual in Spanish and English but with varying levels of ability in each of the languages. All of the students present in the classes were asked to participate, but only seven of those who were comfortable with their level of English proficiency volunteered. These individuals were contacted on multiple occasions, but only three were ultimately able to participate in the one-on-one interviews. As explained below, field notes were taken to record additional information about all of the program participants. The interviewees were all in their late 20s to mid-30s and hopeful about their futures. They are all mothers and either separated or divorced. One interviewee, Christina, was unemployed, has two children, and aspires to be a CNA and to improve her life for her family. A second interviewee, Rosa, was also unemployed and taking English as a Second Language classes so she could also join the CNA program. She has two nieces living with her, has a baby on the way, and thinks the program will help her follow her “dreams.” The third interviewee, Alma, was employed, having found a job and been promoted to a managerial position in just 3 months. She has four children and is planning to buy her own home in the near future. She is working to “break the cycle” and raise her children differently from the way she was. The three women were interviewed about the curricular and pedagogical experiences that are most effective for their learning and for financial behavior change, as well as about the influence of their Latino background on those experiences.</p>

<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>In addition to the six interviews described above, additional data were collected and analyzed about Mujeres Fuertes as a whole. Class observations were conducted and detailed field notes were used during and immediately following the observations and interviews. A tour of the facility following the first observation contributed information to these notes. The field notes also added to the emerging nature of the data collection by allowing for a rapport-building, clarification period during the interviews for any issues or questions I had about the observations. Additionally, during the tour, a multitude of documents were collected for later analysis. Documents were also collected during and after the interviews, illustrating the “flexible data collection” encouraged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713612460267">Eisenhardt (2002)</xref>, and included information from the program and community center website, program orientation information, brochures and handouts about educational and employment opportunities, brochures about partner organizations, the program curriculum, PowerPoint presentations from the observed classes, and administrative charts documenting outcomes.</p>
<p>The data were categorized and organized into manageable units using aggregation, creating classifiable categories as they were collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713612460267">Merriam &amp; Simpson, 2000</xref>), rather than waiting until all data were collected to begin classification. This initial data analysis followed the method presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741713612460267">Warren and Karner (2010)</xref>, who recommend the use of “open coding to develop analytic patterns or themes” (p. 219). All of the interview transcripts and field observation notes were entered into a qualitative software program, NVivo 8, used to code and filter data, allowing for more efficient and accurate collection of coded themes. Data and analysis were verified using member checks for confirming thematic interpretations, peer debriefing, and triangulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0741713612460267">Stake, 2006</xref>) to confirm the presence and interpretation of the themes and ideas. The triangulation procedures, in particular, demonstrated a high level of complementary results between the participants and educators, indicating agreement in their understanding of the learning process taking place in the financial education program.</p>

<title>Findings and Discussion</title>
<p>Three major findings emerged from both the interviews and the data about the whole program regarding the factors that influence the teaching and learning that takes place in this financial education program for Latina single mothers: (a) the program uses a holistic approach to financial education that includes the provision of resources, development of learners’ leadership skills, and creation of a cultural community between participants; (b) the program uses a pedagogy that emphasizes content and process, including the stories as a pedagogical tool and source of knowledge and connection between learners; and (c) the program emphasizes encouragement and learner financial behavior change. Throughout each of these findings runs the thread of sociocultural influences that affect the teaching and learning in this adult financial education program. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0741713612460267">Sprow (2010)</xref> for a complete discussion of the findings.</p>
<sec id="section8-0741713612460267">
<title>A Holistic Approach and a Cultural Community</title>
<p>Mujeres Fuertes sees the learners as whole persons who are individuals, as part of a larger community of women, as well as a part of a community of Latinas, which is translated into the classroom and into the program overall. This approach takes into account the life circumstances of the learners, including their family situations, education, employment, language, age, and other sociocultural factors. Evidence from other financial education programs demonstrates that this finding of the use of a holistic approach is unique in that most programs focus only on skills and knowledge about financial topics.</p>
<sec id="section9-0741713612460267">
<title>A holistic approach with leadership</title>
<p>The program does not limit the education received only to knowledge about financial matters, discussed in the upcoming content section, but takes a holistic approach that extends beyond the financial education classroom. The findings indicate that the women are learning basic financial knowledge, they are also learning how to take an active role in their own lives, in making changes, in developing a sense of responsibility, and then in becoming leaders in their community. The advantage of this approach recognizes the multitude of factors that influence the financial management decisions each person makes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0741713612460267">Tisdell, Taylor, &amp; Sprow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0741713612460267">Vitt et al., 2005</xref>) and gives the learners tools to make the best decisions for their needs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0741713612460267">Vitt (2009)</xref> states that, “the societal influences on financial decision-making behaviors are so pervasive that it is necessary for financial educators to focus . . . on the context of their cultural and social environment” (p. 7).</p>
<p>To do this, Mujeres Fuertes provides access to all resources and support that the learners might need, with the advantage of having the three community service organizations working together. For example, the data showed that the program participants are able to access a variety of resources within the community for help with child care, housing, child support, food, utilities, counseling services for themselves and their family, or for assistance with understanding their employment rights, and the interviewed participants emphasized these services as being instrumental in their ability and motivation to attend the program. The financial educators provide locations for tax preparation, ways to raise a credit score, responsibilities related to home buying and maintenance, renter’s rights, and how to access banking services, all in addition to the basic financial education in the classroom. As part of the leadership curriculum, Mujeres Fuertes also emphasizes the history and accomplishments of Latinos and women, assisting the learners in finding pride in their cultural background. The interviewed program participants made special note of the importance of the recognition of the value of their cultural background by the program as being instrumental in improving their self-esteem and confidence in making their own financial decisions.</p>
<p>In addition, Mujeres Fuertes shows the learners how to find the information they require themselves, helping them reach a higher level of independence in all areas of their lives, fighting against the traditional gender roles of Latina women. Marisa specifically talked about this during her interview, noting that the women in the program become so active in asking for what they need that workers in the community center can tell who attends the program based on their behavior in asking for more opportunities to learn. The program acts as a facilitator for the women. Although these kinds of skills do not specifically have to do with financial education and learning, the women who participated in the program all talked about how their learning in these areas of their lives has positively affected their personal financial management abilities and successes. Both the financial educators addressed this combined effort on multiple occasions, talking about the incorporation of community issues in the financial education classroom and then about how that connects the leadership component with the financial component. Marisol stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>We are always trying to make a connection between the finances and the leadership and how it impacts yourself and you pocket, but also your children and your community as a whole [and] we have noticed that each component, you know you might think that it’s an individual, stand-alone component, but they all really correlate with each other.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to these efforts to appeal to all parts of the program participants’ lives, Mujeres Fuertes also hopes that the lessons they teach the program participants will then extend to their children, families, and the community. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713612460267">Jorgensen and Savla (2010)</xref>, family financial attitudes are significant to the development of the financial attitudes of children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0741713612460267">
<title>Creating a cultural community</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0741713612460267">Vitt et al. (2005)</xref> point out that community organizations “provide comfortable (and safe) financial education settings for many people . . . they offer hope, motivation” (p. 10). Mujeres Fuertes relies on the close connections created by their shared experiences to ensure attendance, support, and information about the learners as they progress through the program, as well as engendering hope and motivation in a safe environment. This kind of meeting and sharing of experiences is imitative, whether intentionally or unintentionally, of the consciousness-raising groups encouraged by feminism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0741713612460267">Weitz, 1982</xref>). It was in these groups that the women connected with one another through their commonalities, which led to increases in self-esteem and reductions in depression, something the women in Mujeres Fuertes experienced themselves. Beginning with the formation of cohorts, the program creates a community that enriches, supports, and contributes to the holistic approach. Although the participants come from different countries and cities, they share a language, a personal history, a culture, and the community, all of which function to pull them together into their own community inside the cohort. They quickly develop close family-like connections with one another. The interviewees discussed how the cohort had become their “family” and how they knew each other very well by the end of the first class, down to the amount of food each individual would eat. The findings from these phenomena and their apparent effects on learning in the financial education classroom are demonstrated through an emphasis in the program on the commonalities among the learners’ experiences, the use of food to create connections, and the ways the learners bond as Latina women.</p>
<p>As noted previously, the participants in the program are from different countries, and many aspects of their lives differ. In spite of the differences, there is an emphasis in the program on commonality and the experiences they share in their life circumstances. The women self-identify as Latinas. Although problematic in the literature on Latino identities, the reasons for choosing one term to refer to the entire group of learners is not about social exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741713612460267">Oboler, 1996</xref>) or creating an “other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741713612460267">Hernandez-Truyol, 1997</xref>) but rather is a way of creating an inclusive way of seeing the cohort of learners. It is not meant to diminish in any way the uniqueness of each person’s own individual heritage or essentialize her experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741713612460267">Darder, Torres, &amp; Gutierrez, 1997</xref>) but rather to reflect the possibilities in coming together as a group to support one another in their similar background and experiences. Evidence of other commonalities include the male-dominated culture in Latino communities, a love of food and the connecting role food has in the Latino community, and a desire to empower themselves through education.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious ways in which this shared culture creates a community of support for the learners is through the use of Spanish, which addresses the need pointed out in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741713612460267">Marlowe and Atiles (2005)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741713612460267">National Council of La Raza (2004)</xref> citing language issues as one of the primary factors in low financial literacy rates among Latinos. The program honors the shared history of its learners by running the entire program in Spanish, including by any guest speakers. Problematic at times, with the financial education vocabulary, the women were sharing, all together, some of the issues of living on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713612460267">Anzaldúa’s (1987)</xref> “frontera [border]” between the two worlds. Sharing the experience and negotiating the meaning together, the cohort of women becomes more supportive for one another. The machismo or gender bias that exists in much of Latino culture is also related to money and the handling of money and is a shared experience by the Mujeres Fuertes participants. Sonya and Marisol pointed out that Latina women are often not raised to take responsibility for their families’ financial management, including bringing money into the home. Although this situation is not present in all families, the program staff agreed that this differentiation between homemaking and moneymaking can have a detrimental financial and marginalizing effect on the women raised to do only the former.</p>
<p>Food sharing is a tool the program appears to use effectively to create community within the cohorts, a topic that emerged during the first interview and persisted through all of the others. It is important for the participants to bring and share food with the cohort as a way to build connections, which reflects the importance of sharing food in many Latino cultures. The emphasis here is on the idea of caring about one another and about their families and their success, which comes out through sharing food. This practice of sharing food can also be considered as valuing and emphasizing the “social meanings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741713612460267">Prins, 2005</xref>, p. 85) that are most significant to the learners. Marisa and Sonya used the example of the one cohort of learners who chose not to share food as evidence of its significance. The one cohort ended up with many dropouts compared with other cohorts. Sharing food appeared to be a bridge to making friends and then closer relationships with the women, giving them support from the new community that is created. Sonya discussed this idea:
<disp-quote>
<p>The importance of that is the sharing of the little or big item that you have. It doesn’t have to be something extraordinary . . . And it’s very simple ingredients, but they do it in such a way, and it’s like, it doesn’t have to be what’s in it, but in how it’s prepared and how it’s offered. And, within the culture, it’s that. You are welcome.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this way, then, Mujeres Fuertes is honoring “their unique cultural heritage and distinct ways of knowing about the world” and helping create a family-like atmosphere of caring and sharing that appears to carry over from the food break table to the classroom, and then into their lives outside of class. The work being done at Mujeres Fuertes also reflects the research in adult education that demonstrates the importance of recognizing and valuing “our sociocultural histories, identities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713612460267">Alfred, 2003</xref>, p. 258). The relationships created by the commonalities and shared culture and practices result in the close community that is created. The connections made with the other participants can lead to family-like relationships, in which they watch out for each other, keep track of the happenings in each other’s lives, and support each other to manage their money more wisely and to provide a better career for themselves. Alma’s experience with her cohort also indicates the depth of their relationships:
<disp-quote>
<p>Although I do have family, we all confide in each other. When one of us are down, we try to bring each other up. I think we are really, really close. I would say that I’ve never known a sorority sister setting, but I would say it’s something like that. Because you know, we do feel like we’re family with each other.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This cultural community from the classroom then melts over into the community, partly through the work the women do in the leadership part of the program. The leadership classes include work on Latina history and culture. In this way, the program is providing the core topics while accessing the learners’ “funds of knowledge . . . and a historical grounding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741713612460267">De Jesus, 2005</xref>, p. 365]), a technique that schools have found useful in countering the lack of academic achievement by Latino students. These kinds of connections between the Latina women might also be a function of the program’s creation of a space for the women to feel valued and in which they “fit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741713612460267">Anzaldúa, 1990</xref>), rather than being an “other” in the hegemonic White culture. This encouragement of the women to honor and foreground their cultural experiences can be seen as evidence of the potential for organic intellectuals to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741713612460267">Morales, 1998</xref>). It is this role of the leadership part of the program that values the women and their knowledge that demonstrates to the women that their experiences are valuable to the community. In this setting, the learners are the culture and the community from which they can draw strength and grow, contributing to the cultural community within the program.</p>

<sec id="section11-0741713612460267">
<title>Pedagogy of Content and Process</title>
<p>The content of the financial education courses demonstrates that the topics follow those typically covered in financial education courses, including budgeting, credit scores and reducing debt, loans, taxes, and home ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0741713612460267">Tisdell et al., 2010</xref>). The findings show traditional delivery of the content in Mujeres Fuertes, which is not surprising considering that most “traditional consumer education focuses on technical skills” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0741713612460267">Sandlin, 2005</xref>, p. 166). However, the data also reveal that the program, although guided by the curriculum, experiments with other techniques to more effectively deliver information and adjusts the content to meet the needs of the Latina women. In fact, the educators see the most benefit from the activities that break from the traditional delivery method. Hands-on methods (e.g., computers for amortization tables, budgeting activities) appear to be especially valuable for the students by engaging them with pedagogical techniques, including through the use of stories.</p>
<p>The decisions on topics covered, guest speakers, and materials are all based on what the educators know about the learners, what knowledge they would like to have, and what they have expressed that they need. This was seen in practice in the classroom, when the educator adjusted her lesson to specifically address the tax situations of the learners, including dealing with illegal immigrants and stolen personal information. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0741713612460267">Vitt (2009)</xref> points out about teaching in the financial education setting, “the more you know about your learners’ cultural context, the closer you will be to unlocking the secrets of their financial behavior” (p. 13). In knowing the learners, the educators can be sure the curriculum and activities reflect their needs, including those associated with their sociocultural background. For example, both the educators addressed the specific needs related to learner gender and the Latino culture and described how they tweak the courses to fit the backgrounds of the learners, which can vary depending on the makeup of each cohort.</p>
<sec id="section12-0741713612460267">
<title>Use of personal stories</title>
<p>Much of the sociocultural information about the learners comes from the use of stories by the participants that the educators use as a source of knowledge and as a learning tool. Recalling that the educators use their own stories from time to time to emphasize a point, to personalize the content, and to make the women feel comfortable, they also encourage the learners to share their own stories with their classmates. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741713612460267">Gay (2010)</xref> points out in her text about culturally responsive teaching, stories are a “powerful means for people to establish bridges across other factors that separate them . . ., penetrate barriers to understanding, and create feelings of kindredness” (p. 3). Reflecting the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0741713612460267">Worthman (2008)</xref>, which demonstrated the importance of valuing “learner experiences as a resource for learner” (p. 457), the women in this setting share a background with similar sociocultural influences, a feature of their histories that can be used for teaching and learning. As previously noted, the findings indicate that the educators tailor the topics in their classes to fit the needs of the learners, rather than staying with the one-size-fits-all approach to planning their curriculum. This is not a surprising finding, given the fact that the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0741713612460267">Tisdell at al. (2010)</xref> study also found that 95.5% of financial educators, in a nationwide survey, believe that it is important to take the needs of the learners into account rather than using the same approach for everyone.</p>
<p>The financial educators appear to share their own personal stories as a pedagogical tool to make the learners feel more comfortable, to personalize the sometimes complex or uninteresting financial education material, to encourage the learners to share their own stories, and to connect with the learners on a more personal level. Marisol and Sonya specifically addressed in the interviews and demonstrated during the class observations the difficulty of talking about financial mistakes or difficult financial situations, but in demonstrating their own real personal experiences, the educators are able to make the women learners feel at ease about their own situations. The learners responded positively to the stories of the educators, indicating in the interviews that they felt like they could relate to the educators who were “like them.” The learners also appear to use their own personal stories in much the same manner but likely without the educators’ objectives of improving the learning experience. In telling their stories, the learners create connections with one another, personalize the content of the class, and encourage other learners to share their stories, while also turning themselves into additional sources of experience and information for their classmates to access.</p>
<p>This sharing of stories by the educators and learners contributes to creating trust and comfort and to building the sense of community in the classroom. Through sharing their experiences, they are not only soliciting advice or help but also offering up their own “wisdom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741713612460267">Sealey-Ruiz, 2007</xref>, p. 52) with one another, wisdom that might have been gained through difficult circumstances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741713612460267">Gay (2010)</xref> posits that “stories educate us about ourselves and others; they capture our attention on a very personal level, and entice us to see, know, desire, imagine, construct, and become more than what we currently are” (p. 3). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741713612460267">Sealey-Ruiz (2007)</xref> found that this process allows the women to use their own voices to express their experiences and come away with a more positive self-image and an affirmation of their own histories, communities, and goals. The nonjudgmental, private, and safe environment that is created for the women allows this storytelling to be positive, creating, perhaps, motivation to make even more progress.</p>
<p>The learning experience of the women in the program is strongly strengthened and enhanced by the fact that the program and the educators work together to make the life circumstances of the learners and their cultural background relevant to their learning, while still delivering the financial knowledge to them through traditional and alternative types of activities and presentations. The knowledge the program and educators possess about the learners and their backgrounds makes them able to not only assist them with the necessary resources but also combat the debilitating effects of the culture on the learners’ lives. They create a strong community of learning and teach the women how to take control of their lives, in the financial aspects and all other areas of their lives.</p>

<sec id="section13-0741713612460267">
<title>Promotion of Financial Behavior Change</title>
<p>The goal of any financial education program is improved financial management behavior. Clearly, education should be equivalent to an increase in knowledge, but the knowledge without any accompanying action taken by the learners would be nearly meaningless in their lives. One way of seeing behavior change is through a model that explains the process, in this case, the TTM of behavior change. As noted, TTM has gained recent attention in financial education research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0741713612460267">Schuchardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0741713612460267">Shockey &amp; Seiling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0741713612460267">Spader et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0741713612460267">Xiao, Newman, et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0741713612460267">Xiao, O’Neill, et al., 2004</xref>) as a possible way for educators to respond more accurately to the needs of the learners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741713612460267">Kerkman (1998)</xref> applied these stages of change for financial counselors and then created “interventions that are appropriate and effective for each particular stage” (p. 20) to be taken by the counselors in order to encourage forward movement by clients through the stages. For example, forward movement through those stages might be encouraged by educational support and focus of lessons in raising the emotions of the learners related to money and finances, raising learners’ awareness of their social responsibility, and/or improving their self-esteem.</p>
<p>The findings from the class observations and interviews, as well as from the financial tracking done by the program, indicate that the learners in Mujeres Fuertes are changing their behavior with regard to their personal money management. Marisol and Sonya are using various techniques to ensure that they are reaching learners at different stages of change. Evidence of changes are seen through the methods used by Mujeres Fuertes, including tracking their financial behavior, motivating the learners to make changes, setting goals, and building on small changes. Documented from the first week of the 3-year program, the financial educators track progress using individual action plans. They focus on savings, credit scores, salaries, and debt. Savings, noted by Marisol as the easiest information to track, has increased for the women, with the goal of saving 10% of their income. Sonya and Marisol see small steps as successful, such as simply opening a savings account and making small deposits. They also indicate an improvement of 19 points, on average, for credit scores and a decrease in debt. This information is also used to assist the women in obtaining any social services for which they might be eligible, such as rent subsidies and child care, another way the program assists the women in meeting the needs that exist in all areas of their lives.</p>
<p>One of the key factors in making changes in behavior is motivation for change. Seeing their own progress is a strong motivator for the program participants. The interviewees demonstrated pride and achievement in the small successes, such as having enough money to purchase a hamburger after all the bills were paid or buying only the items on a shopping list and not making any spontaneous purchases. These activities are encouraged by the financial counselors and by their peers in the courses as well as through the role models they see in the women who are farther along in the program. The participants exhibit another important aspect of behavior change—the setting of goals. The financial educators spend much time on how to set small, short-term goals and long-term goals. Many of the women would like to purchase homes, a long-term goal, but they also have shorter term goals, such as having money saved for emergencies. All of the interviewees indicated that the small changes rewarded them immediately, offering the motivation to continue the better financial management habits.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Programs such as Mujeres Fuertes offer inspiration for the rest of the world of financial literacy education. Although the teaching and learning that is happening at that location cannot be fully generalized to the population as a whole, the experiences of these courageous Latina learners and educators allow a closer look at the influence of sociocultural factors on financial education. It cannot be denied that much of the apparent success of this program, as seen through the enthusiasm of the participants, can be attributed to a greater acknowledgement of importance of the cultural background of the learners for the learning process as they experience it, including the sociocultural factors of being women and Latinas.</p>
<p>Insights are not limited, however, to the education itself but can be expanded to a more thorough understanding of how culture can offer additional pedagogical opportunities for adult learning. One of the core elements of sociocultural and critical perspectives is the importance of valuing and respecting the experiences of learners in the process of learning. Mujeres Fuertes demonstrates this element in action, showing us how to incorporate and capitalize on the experiences of their learners as Latina single mothers, as they navigate through the process of learning, changing their behavior, and then taking an active role in their community. From an even more critical perspective, however, it must be recognized that the program under examination in this study does not adequately address the more serious social, political, and economic issues associated with the power of financial institutions in underserved communities, particularly in communities of color. The program does attempt to acknowledge the importance of leadership in the community, likely with the longer term objective of social change. Financial education can benefit from this holistic approach to teaching and learning, which recognizes the full life circumstances of the learners and uses the experiences of the learners to enhance the quality of their educational experience. If the mission of financial education is to help learners make more responsible and positive financial decisions, the holistic approach, exemplified so well at Mujeres Fuertes, can assist with accomplishing those goals.</p>
