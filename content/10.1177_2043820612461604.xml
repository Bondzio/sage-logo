O’Lear occupies this space of difference early in the book; actually, even before you get <italic>into</italic> the book, the subtitle ‘Scale and Power’ lays out the central concepts through which O’Lear intends to approach the field. Scale is, of course, central to geography and has been well-developed in the field. O’Lear’s conceptualization of scale is, similar to the rest of the book, extraordinarily clear and subsequently serves as a means of foregrounding the geography of environmental politics throughout the text in a theoretically cutting-edge and yet in an accessible way.</p><p>Power fares less well, but in this O’Lear is hardly alone. Power is a notoriously poorly debated topic in political geography. Most textbooks have no account of power whatsoever, and so O’Lear’s instinct to embed power at the center of her account is a radical one. O’Lear begins with a Foucault-influenced discussion of the need to pay attention to the processes by which topics are ruled in, or out, of ‘the political’. She is also clearly aware of power as something relational; she mentions that ‘power dynamics’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612461604">Massey, 2000</xref>) and her earlier discussion of scale embed relationality at the core of scalar politics. Nevertheless, an explicit theorization of the spatiality of power never quite infiltrates the text.</p><p>Instead, O’Lear draws on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612461604">Mann (1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612461604">1993</xref>) to operationalize power. Citing his 1986 definition of power as ‘the ability to pursue and attain goals through mastery of one’s environment’ (p. 6), O’Lear introduces a 2 × 2 matrix with intensive/extensive power on one axis and authoritative/diffused power on the other. The latter binary recognizes (generally) the difference between top–down and bottom–up organizing power, while the former indicates the spatial scale and intensity of that organization – broad and semiautonomous or narrow and rigid. Together, this matrix allows Mann (and O’Lear) to consider different forms of organizational reach, from an army platoon (intensive and authoritative) to market capitalism (extensive and diffused).</p><p>This matrix of organizational reach seems to be introduced primarily to help characterize Mann’s four ideal types of social power: ideological, economic, military, and political (the matrix does not feature substantively in the subsequent chapters). O’Lear identifies these as ‘ideal’ types that are rarely found in isolation, but she also cites Mann’s claim that they each represent ‘a different <italic>source</italic> of power’ (p.18, emphasis mine). Rather than something constituted through social relationships, power becomes something stemming from sources/resources, as originally sketched in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612461604">Giddens’s (1984)</xref> schema of allocative and authoritative resources. This paradoxically reduces the complexity associated with power earlier in the text. A corollary of Giddens’s notion is that conflicts are resolved in favor of whomever can bring the most resources to bear, but when considered alongside her earlier avowal of ‘power relations’, O’Lear seems to be following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612461604">Allen (2003</xref>: p. 44), who argues that ‘[c]rucial to [resource-based power] is the recognition that power itself is <italic>not</italic> a resource, but rather something generated … through the control and reproduction of different kinds of resources’. In short, O’Lear introduces an uneven spatiality to power by associating it with certain individuals and institutions who can ‘reach out’ and harness resources (ideas, capital, weapons, the state, for each ideal form of power, respectively).</p><p>However, more recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612461604">Allen (2009</xref>: p. 206) has advocated a shift from this conceptualization of power’s spatiality, which he referred as topographical, to a <italic>topological</italic> consideration of power as constitutive of space:<disp-quote><p>Power relations, in topological terms, are not so much located in space or extended across it, as <italic>compose</italic> the spaces of which they are a part. On this account, spatiality itself is imbued with power; proximity, distance and reach are inseparable from the practices of power which define them.</p></disp-quote>In this account, power is not the ability to reach out across space and access resources, but rather the ability to constitute space itself such that resources are copresent, rendering an actor ‘powerful’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612461604">Sharp et al. (2000</xref>: p. 25) argue that this perspective ‘regards power very much as an <italic>effect</italic> of the entanglements, emerging from the spatial assemblages rather than somehow pre-existing them in disembodied but coherent units[.]’. Both Allen and Sharp et al. seem to be arguing in parallel; spatial relationships and power are coconstitutive, and therefore geography is central to any politics.</p><sec id="section1-2043820612461604"><title>From topography to topology</title><p>At this point, it is worth stepping back and remembering the context in which O’Lear has written this book. It is intended to ‘appeal mainly to advanced students and researchers’ (from the back cover) and is meant to not only speak to geographers but also to political scientists and others interested in environmental politics. As such, it must limit the use of jargon and introduce theory in ways that resonate with the book’s case studies and with the preexisting knowledge brought by this wide range of students to the classroom. I certainly appreciate the challenge of doing so. Writing a textbook is always a balancing act; like Otto von Bismarck said, regarding politics itself, it is ‘the art of the possible’. O’Lear has done an extraordinary job in negotiating her multiple audiences. Nevertheless, if the book is meant to inject spatial theory into the broader field of environmental politics, it is worth considering how a topological notion of power might have made geography even more central to O’Lear’s account than it already is.</p><p>To examine one of O’Lear’s filthiest examples, I turn to her chapter on garbage and waste. The structure of the chapter emphasizes Mann’s ideal types of power, first covering consumption in the developed world and attributing it to ideological power; that ideology shapes the changing relationship between people and garbage over time. The chapter proceeds to consider e-waste, which is used to incorporate the concept of scale, before turning to the impact of bottled water on our environment. Here it is economic and ideological power that is emphasized. The final case study, on which I will now focus, draws on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612461604">Seager’s (1993)</xref> work on the effect of military power on the Soviet environment with the explicit purpose of showing the role of Mann’s military power in producing environmental damage (because it is outside of civil environmental law). O’Lear is clear that military power in this case study overlaps with political and ideological power, as the Soviet state turned its attention to the environment as a ‘stockpile of resources to be utilized for national development’ (p. 131). This claim implicitly adds economic power to the other three already stipulated (it is perhaps problematic that in the Soviet case Mann’s categories are even more collapsed than in most contemporary examples), and therefore it is unclear exactly to what extent the case study is really about military power. In any event, the case study is very effective at showing the uneven topographies of ‘national sacrifice’ produced when certain regions bear the brunt of chemical and environmental damage for industries deemed critical to the ‘national interest’, extrapolating the Soviet findings to the case of Utah’s Tooele County. The case study, therefore, very successfully links questions of scale (here, of the national ‘outranking’ the local) to environmental politics but power remains, despite being central to the purpose of the case study, a rather mushy concept with all four ideal types of power indistinguishably working toward the same end. More importantly, it is excessively topographical, with Moscow being powerful and regions like Semipalatinsk or Tooele County powerless.</p><p>So what would a topological account of military pollution look like? An account focusing on such connections might involve tracing the relationships that constitute sites of pollution as distant, unworthy, and therefore ‘appropriate’ for national sacrifice (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612461604">Larsen and Brock, 2005</xref>) as well as the relationships that constitute the military as an exceptional actor in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612461604">Woodward, 2004</xref>). This would necessarily lead to a consideration of the privileging of the nation over the locality. Such an approach has several advantages. First, it creates symmetry between the relational aspect of power and O’Lear’s networked understanding of scale (e.g., effectively highlighted in her introductory chapter through the example of commodity chains). If space is itself an effect of power, as the topological account maintains, then it is impractical to discuss the production of scale without considering power and the relationships through which it is constituted.</p><p>Second, it also highlights the interconnections between ideological, economic, political, and military power rather than artificially distinguishing them. Actually, detailing these networks of power requires the explication of connections (or the lack thereof) between, for instance, the military and governmental elites or between local elites and national news media. The fruitfulness of such an approach is hinted in O’Lear’s narrative, in which the Tooele County commissioners campaign to continue the environmental destruction of their constituencies (because of corporate campaign contributions). This example shows that tracing these connections enables a greater understanding of resistance, collaboration, and subversion as political authorities undercut one another or perform end-arounds through the network, or as journalists create conflict where otherwise collaboration might have occurred.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2043820612461604"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Of course, the problem in tracing such ‘entanglements of power’ (to steal a phrase from Sharp et al.) is that they almost by definition go on forever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612461604">Strathern, 1996</xref>). Furthermore, actually describing the specifics of power relationships can be tricky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612461604">McFarlane, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612461604">Rocheleau and Roth, 2007</xref>). If these are problems in the detailed microaccounts found in our research publications, they are even greater problems when we try to convey the current state of political geography to students. Textbook writing requires a series of trade-offs as the audience is considered and as detail is sacrificed for overview and conceptual description. I have no answers as to how to provide a nuanced, topological account of power to an undergraduate audience, while also conveying O’Lear’s broader account of environmental politics. Her ‘mushy’ account of power generally works in <italic>Environmental Politics</italic> because of the richness of her case studies, her elegant weaving of narrative, and her nuanced understanding of scalar politics. But it begs the question of how political geography, more broadly, can translate our quite detailed contemporary theories into interdisciplinary contexts that are often lacking in their appreciation of what geography can offer.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612461604"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2003</year>) <source>Lost Geographies of Power</source>. <publisher-loc>Oxford, UK</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Blackwell</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-2043820612461604"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2009</year>) <article-title>Three spaces of power: territory, networks, plus a topological twist in the tale of domination and authority</article-title>. <source>Journal of Power</source> <volume>2</volume>(<issue>2</issue>): <fpage>197</fpage>–<lpage>212</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr3-2043820612461604"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Giddens</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1984</year>) <source>The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration</source>. <publisher-loc>Cambridge, UK</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Polity Press</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr4-2043820612461604"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Larsen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Brock</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2005</year>) <article-title>Great basin imagery in newspaper coverage of Yucca mountain</article-title>. <source>Geographical Review</source> <volume>95</volume>(<issue>4</issue>): <fpage>517</fpage>–<lpage>536</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr5-2043820612461604"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mann</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1986</year>) <source>The Sources of Social Power: A History of Power from the Beginning to A.D. 1760</source>. <publisher-loc>Cambridge, UK</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Cambridge University Press</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr6-2043820612461604"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mann</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1993</year>) <source>The Sources of Social Power: The Rise of Classes and Nation-States, 1760-1914</source>. <publisher-loc>Cambridge, UK</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Cambridge University Press</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr7-2043820612461604"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Massey</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2000</year>) <article-title>Entanglements of power: reflections</article-title>.
