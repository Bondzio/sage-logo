<p><italic>This portion of our show is brought to you</italic></p>
<p><italic>by the Associated Federation of Organizations—</italic></p>
<p><italic>Somewhere there’s an organization just for you</italic>.</p>
<p>—Garrison Keillor, <italic>A Prairie Home Companion</italic></p>
<p>Many music teacher educators are card-carrying members of multiple professional associations and societies. Most of us realize that if you contribute to the work of the association with some regularity, you are likely to be appointed to or asked to run for an office. The typical responsibilities that come with professional leadership involve articulating a mission, developing bylaws, electing representatives, planning conferences, reviewing proposals, launching projects, publishing a newsletter or website that often evolves into a journal, and sponsoring periodic meetings of the board to serve the general membership. These activities create a workable infrastructure for professionals bound together through shared interests. If left unexamined, though, organizations compromise their intended mission by expending most of their energies maintaining these periodic routines and tasks—a self-perpetuating and insular focus that keeps the group treading water but not making much headway. We seek more substantial yields from our valuable investments of time and expertise when balancing professorial commitments to teaching, research, university service, community service, and professional leadership. Why are we motivated to participate? What does it mean for a group such as the Society for Music Teacher Education (SMTE) to strive for more impact? Indeed, what type of impact is possible from a professional association in the rapidly changing and uncertain environment that characterizes education today? For my last column as chair, I take this opportunity to reflect on the challenging nature of our collective work in music teacher education from the perspectives of <italic>wicked problems</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057083711434403">Rittel &amp; Webber, 1973</xref>), balanced with the concept of <italic>good work</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083711434403">H. Gardner, Csikszentmihalyi, &amp; Damon, 2001</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1057083711434403">
<title>Wicked Problems</title>
<p>The notion of a <italic>wicked problem</italic> is usually attributed to a seminal paper published in 1973 by urban planners Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber, who observed that most social problems elude clear definition and resist linear approaches to their solutions. When I first heard this term, common synonyms sprang to mind, such as evil, malicious, nasty, and severe. Rittel and Webber, though, use <italic>wicked</italic> in an especially intriguing way, delineating the concept from common usage by contrasting tame and wicked problems. A tame problem</p>
<list id="list1-1057083711434403" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>has a relatively well-defined and stable problem statement;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>has a definite stopping point, i.e., we know when the solution or a solution is reached;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>has a solution which can be objectively evaluated as right or wrong;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>belongs to a class of similar problems which can be solved in a similar manner; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>has solutions which can be tried and abandoned. (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083711434403">Ritchey, 2011</xref>, p. 19)</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Stop and think for a moment. What sorts of problems in teacher education at large or music teacher education specifically could be categorized as tame under these characterizations? For example, which lines of research can you name in which we have been able to work through a class of problems systematically in order to come to clear solutions with clear resolutions? Citing examples is challenging. The most urgent, complicated, persistent, and interrelated dilemmas in music teacher education are clearly not so tidy and contained. They warrant a more sophisticated, if somewhat daunting, label. <italic>Wicked problems</italic></p>
<list id="list2-1057083711434403" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>are ill-defined, ambiguous, and associated with strong moral, political, and professional issues;</p></list-item><list-item>
<p>are subjective and strongly stakeholder dependent;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>offer little consensus about what the problem actually <italic>is</italic>, let alone how to resolve it;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>won’t keep still—they are sets of complex, interacting issues evolving in a dynamic social context; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>[sometimes spawn] new forms of wicked problems . . . as a result of trying to understand and solve one of them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083711434403">Ritchey, 2011</xref>, p. 20)</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Again, list your most likely candidates. As a starting place, I would nominate the following on my Wicked Problems of Music [Teacher] Education list<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1057083711434403">1</xref></sup>: conceptualizing (good, effective, ethical, excellent) teaching; designing flexible, fair, and fitting systems for music teacher evaluation; aligning musical practices and programs to realize the aims of social justice; closing the gap of access to music study for underrepresented groups; diversifying the music teaching force; reinvigorating the status of music education in schools; responding with clarity to conflicting and competing policy claims about the benefits of music; influencing policy; fostering productive collaborations between schools and universities and within schools of music; supporting meaningful music teacher learning through professional development; preparing new music teachers for an uncertain future; and generating innovative and sustainable curricular reform in our field.</p>
<p>Each one of these problem domains is infused with uncertainty, ambiguity, and contradiction. Various stakeholders frame and investigate any of the domains from distinctly different vantage points. Our good scholarly habits predispose us to study any problem space deeply and thoroughly by consulting the literature, debating, conceptualizing, and taking the time to construct elegant and beautifully rendered plans before we launch forth toward solution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083711434403">Conklin (2006</xref>, chap. 1) contends that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>while studying a novel and complex problem is natural and important, it is an approach that will run out of gas quickly if the problem is wicked. Pure study amounts to procrastination, because little can be learned about a wicked problem by objective data gathering and analysis. (p. 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is an unsettling remark, but it rings true with the ongoing demands of responding, reacting, and reflecting on policy issues and persistent calls for reform in teacher education that sometimes shape-shift into something else entirely before we can even list some possible strategies for action. Reading the literature about wicked problems gives us insights (and perhaps permission) to alter our approaches. What is quite clear to me when applied to music teacher education is that the amelioration of some of the dilemmas that beset the field can only be apprehended from multiple perspectives, tackled from many angles, and addressed by moving more quickly into action, while staying alert to unexpected dilemmas and solutions that emerge along the way. Accordingly, the notion of good work helps us mobilize our collective strengths and capacities as a society.</p>

<title>Good Work</title>
<p>For a society to move beyond a self-perpetuating cycle of meetings and activities, it must align with larger purposes, move forward with appropriate speed, and respond to criticism of its efforts. At the end of the first decade of SMTE’s history, Eunice Boardman, who served as the first appointed chair of the society in 1984, took stock of the group’s early accomplishments and questioned whether the society had become the “strong and active force that [serves] as a cohesive agent for the profession” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057083711434403">Boardman, 1992</xref>, p. 2). More recent criticism of the status of music teacher education within the profession came from Jeff Kimpton in his address in Minneapolis in 2004:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We’re still waiting for leadership from, and standing in, this organization (MENC), as well as recognition that there is a need for new models, sponsored research or networks of colleges and districts, teachers and professors and students doing innovative work. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083711434403">Kimpton, 2005</xref>, p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Current efforts since the establishment of the Greensboro Symposium in 2005, and particularly the renewed level of discourse and action fostered by the Areas for Strategic Planning and Action (ASPAs) are part of the renaissance of the Society. The concordance of research, practice, and policy has triggered sustained and significant work by the ASPAs. The restructuring of SMTE has prompted wiser use of intellectual capital while fostering greater participation, collegiality, flexibility, and especially <italic>productivity.</italic> ASPAs exemplify a principle of organizational management described by the noted public leader John W. Gardner, who described a self-renewing organization as one with</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>many points of initiative and decision, [thus] an innovation stands a better chance of survival; it may be rejected by nine out of ten decision makers and accepted by the tenth. If it then proves its worth, the nine may adopt it later. (J. W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083711434403">Gardner, 1981</xref>, p. 68)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many points of initiative and discussion enable important projects and initiatives to take root and move into implementation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083711434403">Howard Gardner, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, and William Damon (2001)</xref> explore the concept of good work in professional domains in the fascinating book, <italic>Good Work: When Excellence and Ethics Meet</italic>. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, they interviewed more than 1,200 subjects from nine professional domains to answer the question “How do individuals who want to do good work—work that is excellent in quality, personally engaging and meaningful, and carried out ethically—succeed or fail at times when things are changing very quickly?” Good work is represented as a triple helix of excellence, ethics, and engagement/meaning; the satisfaction derived from the work depends on the intersections of these three foundations. Unlike many organizational management books that privilege financial success over all other factors, the authors take a more humane and contextual view of professionalism. As part of a multiyear research consortium, the designated professional realms were analyzed according to four components (<italic>individual practitioners</italic>—the persons who elect the profession; <italic>domains</italic> or cultures that share knowledge, skills, practices, rules, and values; <italic>the field</italic>, including the gatekeepers, expert practitioners, and institutions; and <italic>other stakeholders</italic>, including consumers and citizens). The book concentrates on two areas—genetics and journalism—although other reports are published elsewhere. Genetics was found to exemplify the characteristics of a well-aligned domain; journalism did not. The authors concluded,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A professional realm is healthiest when the values of the culture are in line with those of the domain, when the expectations of stakeholders match those of the field, and when domain and field are themselves in sync. When these conditions exist, individual practitioners are free to operate at their best, morale is high, and the professional realm flourishes. We term this a situation of <italic>authentic alignment</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083711434403">H. Gardner et al., 2001</xref>, p. 27)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly, the contrast between authentic alignment and the current state of music education, music teacher education, or education at large should be disturbingly evident. The frustration that many teachers and academics feel about their professional autonomy is inextricably linked to the political milieu in which schools and universities operate. We often feel buffeted by forces beyond our control, especially as we fill yet another set of forms to document how teacher education programs meet proliferating requirements for licensure, just as one all-too-familiar instance.</p>
<p>Although Gardner’s consortium analyzed entire professional domains, I wondered if some of these characteristics could be applied to the good work of a professional society. With considerable license, I have adapted a diagram from an analysis of higher education, another of the domains included in the large-scale project. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083711434403">Berg, Csikszentmihalyi, and Nakamura (2003)</xref> looked at institutional strengths, mission statements, hiring practices, constituents, choice of leaders, responses to changes and challenges, and mapped them according to the components of social/cultural forces, external stakeholders, domain and field of higher education (gatekeepers) when considering institutions and their missions in order to trace whether their work was aligned or misaligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1057083711434403">Figure 1</xref>). Authentic alignment as described by Gardner et al. is undoubtedly a moving target, but in thinking about the ill-defined, subjective, consensus-resistant, dynamic, and open-ended nature of wicked problems, I find it helpful to portray the multidimensional arenas that must be held at attention as we strive toward seeing more of the factors that contribute to the whole. The claims and expectations of stakeholders, practitioners, researchers, the public, policy makers, and the teachers can be mapped, compared, and examined for divergence and areas of consensus. The resultant diagram is an attempt to capture the complexity of the challenges facing our field, as we align our concerted and collective efforts.</p>

</fig>
<p>As a professional society, SMTE seeks to understand and act on the entire system, while also maximizing expertise by addressing smaller scale concerns through the ASPA structure. Music teacher educators can contribute to vital work within an ASPA in a way that maximizes the contributions of individuals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083711434403">H. Gardner et al. (2001)</xref> describe this goodness of fit:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Harmonious professional realms exist when individual practitioners are attracted to the domains that most suit their interests and abilities, when they are allowed to develop and grow within the parameters of the practice, and when their rewards are commensurate with their skills and contributions. (p. 30)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Pursuing the triple helix of excellence, ethics, and engagement (and the journey toward realization is probably its own reward) inspires us to pursue good work on behalf of music teacher education. At the recent symposium, the conference theme of <italic>intersections of practice, research, and policy</italic> summoned us to think across categories and areas of specialization, which is critical if we are to address these intersecting problem domains, and to ground our initiatives in the overall milieu of social/cultural forces, stakeholders, and gatekeepers. Failing to do so compromises our efforts as individuals or as a professional society. In a study of leadership, the psychologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083711434403">Robert Sternberg (2007)</xref> wrote, “wisdom is in large part a decision to use one’s intelligence, creativity, and knowledge for a common good” (p. 38). Enabling the integrity and public standing of music teachers’ work is a worthy application of such leadership.</p>

<title>Coda</title>
<p>I return to Garrison Keillor’s quip that “somewhere, there’s an organization just for you.” I am deeply indebted to the SMTE Executive Committee, ASPA Facilitators, the National Executive Board of NAfME and staff for their support of SMTE efforts in the past 2 years. It is a privilege to pursue good work in these challenging times with those who bring such vitality and optimism to the mission. I want to make special note of the exemplary leadership that our immediate past Chair, Linda Thompson, has brought to the Society, and to welcome Doug Orzolek, whose impressive organizational skills and talents will enable productive growth. It has been 30 years since Charlie Leonhard acted as the catalyst for the organization of SMTE at TMEA in San Antonio. From our contemporary vantage point, I imagine that some of the problems expressed at that time are still robust and resilient, but other wicked problems have surfaced and will continue to do so. Although much is in flux, I take satisfaction in knowing that SMTE is poised strategically to address these challenges through its commitment to do good work on behalf of music teachers.</p>
