<p>The Cohens came to Israel in 1980. I was then a junior faculty, only three years after completing my graduate studies at the University of Chicago. We connected immediately. I loved Stan’s work on moral panics, his interest in the media and deviance and his fresh and insightful perspectives on almost everything. At that time, the department of sociology at the Hebrew University was dominated by a structural-functional perspective staunchly practised by such luminaries as Shmuel Eisenstadt and Joseph Ben-David. The Department denied Stan’s request to locate in sociology full-or half-time, and the Institute of Criminology was fortunate to embrace him as a full-time faculty member. The rejection by sociology saddened Stan but very quickly he immersed himself in criminology. I was fortunate in sharing many discussions with him, and his impact and influence on my work is obvious. He was one of the few persons then with whom I felt comfortable about freely discussing my work. Back then, social deviance was light years away from the interests of most Hebrew University faculty. Today, of course, the situation is very different. Now a number of Stan’s students teach at the university, work in areas that interested him, and their research reflects his intellectual investment and influence.</p>
<p>He and I discussed moral panics, crime and the media, social control, and the use of qualitative research methods at length. My immersion in the constructivist perspective fundamentally emerged from his ideas. My first two books – on deviance, morality and politics – were tremendously enriched by his feedback; it helped me shape the entire research agenda through which I have come to examine the phenomenon of deviance. I now see politics and morality, social change and stability, through a constructivist, historical lens. The angle through which he approaches <italic>escape attempts</italic> and <italic>visions of social control</italic> implies that living in a culture entails a chronic tension, a struggle, between domiciling oneself in that culture, involving oneself in it, become committed, and caring, yet wanting to break free as well, to turn around, gaze upon that same culture, and reflect critically upon it. Who but a sociologist like Stan could construct such a dilemma and simultaneously live in and through it?</p>
<p>Stan’s stay in Israel sensitized him to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and to the human rights issues that that agonizing struggle entails. The Israeli military occupation of the West Bank was an ongoing source of pain for him, and he became hypercritical of that occupation. The mass violations of human rights that that occupation entailed deeply disturbed him, but he feared as well how that occupation corrupted both Israeli and Palestinian societies. This agonizing awareness moved him slowly but relentlessly into a deep engagement with the broader issue of global human rights. His free spirit, insightful intellect, and impressive knowledge made it difficult for him to remain in the all-too-harsh Israeli reality. For Stan, this was a deeply emotional issue. The turmoil he suffered as a result of living in this Middle Eastern cauldron proved too painful for Stan. After much deliberation and soul-searching, he left Israel in 1996 for the LSE. It was a great loss to everyone here. I recall my exchange with Ben-David, then already quite sick, with crystal sharpness. Joseph said to me, ‘We made a mistake not taking Stan to Sociology?’ to which I responded, ‘Yes, you did.’</p>
<p>Stan’s deep concern about the future of human rights was evident to everyone who knew him; the theme seems to have dominated much of his thoughts in the last few years. When I was a guest editor for the <italic>British Journal of Criminology</italic>’s special issue on moral panics, we tried to have Stan write a paper for the issue. He struggled to produce a piece that – as he wanted – would integrate moral panics with human rights. Unfortunately, his failing health did not allow that.</p>
<p>After 1996, I made it a habit to visit Stan whenever I was in London. Visiting Stan’s office was always a memorable experience. Here, our new faculty tends to furnish their offices like a salon. It is nice, but lacks one ingredient which – to me – is absolutely essential: books. Lots of them. Stan’s office always had lots of books. Visiting Stan and being surrounded by books we had in common always gave me a comfortable feeling of sharing an intellectual terrain. Stan agreed. ‘What do you expect?’ he told me. ‘This is how it needs to be.’</p>
<p>The last time we spoke to one another was in October 2012. He was already sick and could not be at home to care for himself. Conversation was difficult, but with his daughter’s help we managed to exchange some thoughts and experience good moments talking about our shared past.</p>
<p>We academics take for granted that, during our careers, we’ll meet lots of interesting, innovative, creative and bubbly characters. Stan was all of that, and more. He also had something extra and unique. He was a decent man, a mensch, at once naïve, generous, kind, empathetic, caring and remarkably insightful. As long as I live, I will miss him.</p>
