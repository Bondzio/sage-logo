<abstract>
<p>In the context of international growth in higher education exchanges and recent expansion in U.K. mobility rates after a period of some decline, this article examines the perspectives of U.K. students who have decided to spend part of their degree at universities abroad. Based on an analysis of data generated by a cross-institutional survey of “credit-mobile” U.K. students, the article explores their views, evaluations, and priorities with regard to one particular aspect of the study abroad experience—student support. The findings reveal a blend of academic, practical, and socioemotional needs, alongside a predominant reliance on self-direction and proactive social participation as strategies for addressing them. Finally, a number of recommendations for home and host institutional practice and student preparation—in the United Kingdom and other (English-speaking) countries—are considered.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The majority of studies on “international students” have focused on the perspectives of nonnative speakers of English studying at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Anglophone countries—there are relatively few that scrutinize the views of students who are mobile in the opposite direction, that is, those from English-speaking countries who typically spend part of their degree studying at HEIs outside their home country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311436085">Olsen, 2008</xref>). This may in part reflect the fact that such students represent a significantly smaller group, though there is evidence that British students are more—and indeed increasingly—mobile than their counterparts in the United States or Australia, perhaps due to closer geographical ties with continental Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311436085">British Council, 2008</xref>). All the same, several commentators have highlighted the imbalance in the direction of student mobility in the United Kingdom (in other words, the fact that incoming students far outnumber U.K. outflows) and also the barriers that reduce mobility. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1028315311436085">Deacon (2011)</xref>, for example, provides an analysis of a number of social, individual, and practical factors that often act as obstacles in deterring many U.K. students from studying abroad. These include low levels of foreign language competence and personal confidence, financial difficulties, reluctance to leave friends and family, curricular inflexibility, and housing commitments.</p>
<p>Arguably then, this situation heightens an interest in examining the perceptions of those U.K. students who <italic>are/have been</italic> mobile, and this article thus aims to explore this area, with a particular focus on student views of support required and received while abroad. This could prove useful in signposting potential improvements with regard to mechanisms and approaches that could facilitate the study abroad experience. And given that dissatisfied returners have the potential to act as additional barriers to prospective study abroad students, an improved understanding of their needs may at least go some way toward reducing this particular deterrent. The findings may thus also be of interest to study abroad advisers and university managers in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The article is based on an analysis of data generated by a cross-institutional survey of mobile U.K. students and is focused around the following three research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1028315311436085" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1:</italic> What are the expressed support needs of U.K. students studying abroad?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2:</italic> To what extent do students feel their support needs were met?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3:</italic> How did students attempt to address their support needs?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1028315311436085">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The literature on the international student experience is dominated by a fairly defined set of issues—motivations for overseas study, adjustment and transition processes, intercultural learning resulting from residence abroad, and so on. Relatively few have focused specifically on the support angle, examining students’ views, evaluations, and priorities. This is perhaps reflective of the broader research picture, as acknowledged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311436085">Dhillon, McGowan, and Wang (2008</xref>, p. 284), “. . . research on student support systems is limited.” This section offers an overview of the studies available.</p>
<p>First, it should be noted that there is no consensus on what even constitutes support or the factors that motivate it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1028315311436085">Bartram (2009)</xref> discusses three differing motives for supporting students—an instrumental view, driven by recruitment targets and consumerist priorities; a humanistic view, motivated by holistic concerns for individual development; and a therapeutic view, driven largely by concerns for students’ self-esteem. When considering what forms of support different groups of international students require, there is further disagreement in the literature; traditionally, a deficit model has dominated, highlighting the barriers and obstacles faced because of background differences and the additional support needs that result. Such a view is perhaps evident in Rushton et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1028315311436085">Rushton, Cook, &amp; Macintosh, 2006</xref>) description:
<disp-quote>
<p>International students present a suite of problems to teaching, administrative, resource and technical staff over and above those associated with “home” students. Such problems include not just language difficulties but also cultural and social aspects, which provide a real challenge to university staff. (p. 14)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There are of course tensions between acknowledging differences—in an effort to support equity of experience on the one hand—and overstating difference on the other. In general, recent years have seen a greater desire to underplay these differences and move away from prejudiced views of a diminished capacity among a homogenized group of “others,” as academics acknowledge that the challenges international students often face are the same as—or a perhaps amplified version of—those faced by many domestic students and that there is greater commonality of experience than was often thought.</p>
<p>In terms of commonly available student support, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311436085">MacInnis, James, and Hartley (2000)</xref> refer to</p>
<list id="list2-1028315311436085" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>academic support mechanisms (language tuition, study skills development, library services, academic counseling, and the conventional academic support provided by tutors through tutorial discussions, formative and summative assignments, feedback, and general academic guidance),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>practical support (financial advice, careers services, catering facilities, childcare), and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>and social/personal support (personal tuition, counseling, health advice, sports and clubs, Students’ Union).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Nevertheless, the availability and exact nature of these different forms will vary within and between countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311436085">MacInnis et al. (2000)</xref> do not provide a support typology as such, but it is easy to see how the forms of support described fit the three categories identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311436085">Bartram (2008)</xref> corresponding to the types of needs most expressed by international students—academic, practical, and sociocultural. Different typologies are offered by other authors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1028315311436085">Pelletier, 2003</xref>, who offers a more fragmented sevenfold categorization of needs, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311436085">Anderson, Carmichael, Harper, &amp; Huang, 2009</xref>, who add psychological needs as a distinct fourth dimension of needs). Some authors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1028315311436085">Allen &amp; Higgins, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1028315311436085">Humfrey, 1999</xref>) situate these needs within a chronological model that highlights social and practical needs early on in the study abroad experience, with academic needs emerging more prominently later on. The findings of the SCMR survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311436085">Sussex Centre for Migration Research [SCMR], 2004</xref>), one of the few studies examining U.K. students’ experiences abroad, support this model, though other studies with different groups of international students highlight the persistence of sociocultural needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311436085">Ayano, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1028315311436085">Bartram, 2007</xref>) or academic needs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311436085">Gu, Schweisfurth, &amp; Day, 2010</xref>) from the outset.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311436085">Dhillon et al. (2008</xref>, p. 283) examined student views on the effectiveness of support services at one English university and found that “the provision of support facilities cannot guarantee an effective support system.” Furthermore, they uncovered wide variation in students’ awareness of and levels of satisfaction with available services. Although their research was based on U.K. students’ views, it seems unlikely that international students’ experiences should differ markedly, as this finding may well resonate more generally across student groups and countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311436085">Sovic’s (2008)</xref> study of international students in the United Kingdom offers some evidence that this is indeed the case. Her research highlighted the “considerable publicity around all the facilities and support available to international students including induction, website, leaflets, and posters. However, students in our sample tended to know very little about what was on offer” (p. 36). This finding would not appear to be supported by more recent results from the International Student Barometer (ISB), however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311436085">Archer, Davison, &amp; Cheng, 2010</xref>). The ISB—“the global benchmarking study of expectations and experiences of international students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311436085">Archer et al., 2010</xref>, p. 3)—includes student satisfaction with a range of support areas (learning and language support, counseling, visa assistance, etc.) in its assessment and concludes that
<disp-quote>
<p>Satisfaction with support services remains identical to 2009 levels, with slight increases in satisfaction visible for counselling and Student Advisory Services. However, satisfaction with visa advice and the International Office has decreased marginally. Across the previous four years of the measure, satisfaction with support overall has increased by 14%. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311436085">Archer et al., 2010</xref>, p. 11)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These are clearly welcome results, especially when considering the survey’s truly global dimension, though they may well mask the details of less positive individual/group experiences in particular countries and institutions. Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311436085">Sovic (2008)</xref> is arguably justified in suggesting that if support services are to be effective, the provision of information on these issues by conventional means may not always be sufficient, especially when targeted at students from cultures and backgrounds where such services might be unusual or even unknown. In this respect, she cites emotional counseling as an example of a culturally mediated support service; despite its prevalence in many American and European HEIs, many international students in her study discounted using this service because such practices were socially at variance with or unknown in their home cultures.</p>
<p>With regard to specialist services for international students in the United Kingdom, most HEIs have an “international office”; though their function varies widely, these specialist units are often tasked with organizing prearrival documentation and advice, enrolment, induction and orientation, and different forms of language support, alongside occasional trips and social events. Although these may often be effective in meeting international students’ practical and certain social/academic needs, they sometimes fall short in fulfilling their integrational needs, given that many of these support mechanisms are targeted exclusively at nondomestic students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311436085">Sovic’s (2008</xref>, p. 34) study reflected these concerns:
<disp-quote>
<p>It appears from student responses that some strategies for dealing with the substantial number of international students are unintentionally making the situation worse. It appears that special orientation sessions for international students set the tone for what can be become a pattern of separate treatment.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311436085">McLeod and Wainwright’s (2009)</xref> research is interesting in being one of very few studies to highlight what might be described as more “internal” support mechanisms—self-reliance and self-efficacy—as significant strategies, which the American students in their study highlighted as important in addressing student needs and supporting successful study abroad. This idea will be examined later on in relation to the findings of the current study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1028315311436085">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>The current study is based on data generated by an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of two types of questions—a set designed to establish key background features (home and host universities, gender, age, etc.) and a set of open-ended questions asking the students to comment on their perceived support needs and their evaluations of support received. In order to access a wider range of views, discussions were held with colleagues working in the international offices of 10 U.K. universities. After fully briefing them on the nature and intentions of the research and providing assurances of student and institutional anonymity, five agreed to participate in the study and distribute an electronic questionnaire link to students who had engaged in study abroad over the past 5 years. Of the five participating HEIs, two were located in the North of England, two in the Midlands, and one in the South. Two of these were older universities, established in the 1800s; the other three were former polytechnics that achieved university status in 1992.</p>
<p>The link was sent to more than 1,000 students, but responses were received from a total of only 159 individuals. Although this is a somewhat disappointing rate of return, it is hoped that the cross-institutional nature of the survey and the reasonably large sample it generated will go some way toward supporting credible impressions, despite the self-selective nature of the sample and the accompanying potential for selectivity effects. Of the 159 participants, about half had spent two semesters abroad, 15% one semester, and nearly one-third three semesters. The vast majority of these students (96%) studied abroad during the second or third year of their degree, and for most (148 students) this experience was within the last 2 years of completing the survey. More than 90% were aged 18 to 25 (85% were 20 or 21 when studying overseas), and 81% were female. In terms of distribution, the respondents were spread fairly evenly across the five institutions (<italic>n</italic> = 37, <italic>n</italic> = 27, <italic>n</italic> = 28, <italic>n</italic> = 33, <italic>n</italic> = 34). They had attended a total of 45 institutions in 15 different countries in Europe, North America, South America, and the Far East and were studying a broad range of degrees. These include courses in education, geography, engineering, business studies, modern languages, law, European studies, economics, natural sciences, and biology. Of these, 96% had studied or were studying at undergraduate level.</p>
<p>The thematic analysis of the student responses was based on coding using the research questions listed in the introduction. In cases of overlap, segments of data were multiply coded as and where appropriate. This broad approach served to regroup the data into the key areas of interest underpinning the enquiry and was followed by a more detailed vertical analysis of responses to identify subthemes and patterns within the two categories. Findings relating to each question will now be examined in turn. It should be noted that although the total sample consisted of 159 students, not all participants chose to answer each question; hence response totals were often below 159.</p>

<title>Findings and Discussion</title>
<p>The first research question focused on the support needs expressed by the U.K. students. The responses reflected the threefold categorization identified by several authors in the literature review above—academic, practical, and sociocultural needs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1028315311436085">Table 1</xref> offers a numerical breakdown of these groupings.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>As the figures reveal, academic needs appear most noted, reflecting support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311436085">Gu et al.’s (2010)</xref> findings. The primacy of the students’ academic needs is also reflected in an analysis of the negative experiences described by the respondents; 56 students (47%) regarded the academic aspect of their sojourn as the least enjoyable part of their experience. Although this dimension was therefore rated most negatively, it may in itself be a reflection of the fact that students’ motivations centered primarily around personal development, social enhancement, and a sense of adventure (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1028315311436085">Bartram, 2013</xref>, for a fuller discussion of this aspect). Many students offered more detail on their support requirements while abroad. In terms of academic needs, many predictably noted needing help from academic tutors and counselors at both their home and host institutions on course structures, module content and registrations, attendance patterns, assessment requirements, language learning opportunities, and online learning facilities, alongside more general pastoral advice and guidance.</p>
<p>Their practical needs related largely to support with finance and accommodation, two issues that were strongly connected for some students:
<disp-quote>
<p>Financial needs!!!!! So expensive in France and my rent was ridiculous. I did have an Erasmus grant but had to apply for French financial aid as well to literally just put me above the breadline.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Others commented on having been heavily reliant on parents for financial support:
<disp-quote>
<p>Financial support from my parents was vital to be able to live comfortably in Amsterdam, couldn’t have managed without that, money was very tight.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Social support related to help in overcoming initial bouts of homesickness/loneliness and in fulfilling their wider sociocultural needs. Many sought this kind of support from friends and family back at home, though some acknowledged that this was not always productive, in that the frequent contact facilitated by mobile phones and modern technology militated against social adjustment:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was constantly texting and chatting to my boyfriend and family on Skype, which was lovely in some ways, but I think it made me more homesick for longer, and stopped me just getting on with life in Germany.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Others relied on newly established social networks developed with fellow nationals:
<disp-quote>
<p>The other Erasmus students from my university were a lifeline; we helped each other out when we were struggling.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When asked to what extent they felt their support needs had been successfully addressed, 67 students provided a positive response, and 36 felt that their needs had not been met. Although many simply stated that they felt their support needs had or had not been met, some offered more specific insights into the reasons behind their evaluations. All of these related to issues of academic support and largely to the accessibility of staff at home or abroad. Many commented on the importance of a designated member of staff who was regularly available to offer clear advice and guidance, either in person or electronically. This not being the case was noted by several students as the reason why they felt their support needs had not been met:
<disp-quote>
<p>The odd member of staff was helpful, but most were really not. Primarily there were problems with emails not being answered promptly, if at all, and when they were finally answered they didn’t even have a proper answer to the query, meaning I then had to email again and wait again.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Several resented a sense of invisibility they perceived because staff at the host institution appeared unaware of or unconcerned about them as individuals: “They would never seek me out or check on progress.” Some noted a distinct support divide between home and host institutions in this respect:
<disp-quote>
<p>Excellent support from my home chemistry department, but I felt the staff at . . . kept forgetting that I even existed! I wasn’t on any of their lists, so I lost out on all sorts of information.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Others were more critical about the effectiveness of the preparation they had received prior to departure:
<disp-quote>
<p>We could’ve done with being told how much more expensive France was. We’d had a lot of pretty dull and useless lectures beforehand about culture shock but I think it would have been more useful to know about finance.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some expressed a general resentment about a lack of direction and guidance, though one student regarded this as a benefit:
<disp-quote>
<p>We had to find a lot of stuff out for ourselves, they didn’t just set everything up for us—we had to do quite a lot for ourselves which was a good experience.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Having asked the students about the nature of their support needs and the extent to which they felt they were met, they were additionally invited to comment in more detail on how they had attempted to address these needs. This time, a notable difference emerges, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1028315311436085">Table 2</xref> illustrates.</p>

<p>A strong sense of having to draw on their own personal resources and resilience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311436085">McLeod &amp; Wainwright, 2009</xref>) emerged quite prominently from the students’ comments, which revealed an awareness of the need to persevere, be patient, self-console, and to take active responsibility for their needs, as some of the following quotations reveal:
<disp-quote>
<p>I just kept telling myself to make the most of the experience whilst I could and keep busy.</p>
<p>I decided to just keep my head down, work as hard as I could, have a lot of patience, and realize that there just is a lack of organization.</p>
<p>I tried to regard everything in Poland as a sitcom situation and had a good laugh at things and saw everything as a learning curve.</p>
<p>Perseverance!!! I accepted that it would get easier with time and tried to adopt a more laid-back attitude to things. Perseverance really is the key though—if you annoy somebody for long enough, they will help you!</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The large number of comments this time reflecting this sense of self-direction are potentially a result of three things; they may indicate a genuinely high level of self-reliance among these particular students; they might alternatively suggest that the failure of other means necessitated self-reliance; or, on the other hand, the wording of the question may be significant here—asking the students to comment on how they attempted to address their support needs may have focused their minds more directly on individual agency rather than their use of external systems.</p>
<p>Students who commented on academic solutions to their needs restated issues discussed above, particularly with regard to discussing problems with academic counselors and lecturers. One new element to emerge this time concerned student efforts to begin or progress further with foreign language study in an attempt to improve their situation. Of the 21 students who mentioned addressing their needs through academic means, 11 of these referred specifically to the language learning dimension, the following comment being fairly typical:
<disp-quote>
<p>I tried to immerse myself in Spanish to improve it, took an intensive course, and just tried really hard to improve it quickly, as once I was more confident in speaking, lots of things were easier.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The few students who mentioned financial means all referred to temporary employment as a coping strategy, whereas the 20 students who referred to social means as a way of meeting their needs restated a reliance on communication technologies to maintain social networks with friends and family at home or mentioned efforts to form and develop new social connections:
<disp-quote>
<p>I tried to get help from any other lost-looking Erasmus students who spoke more Spanish than I did, and were either English, German, or French. I also tried really hard to talk to people in my classes and lectures and make friends.</p>
<p>I decided to join a local choir to get to know people locally and feel a bit more connected.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In an effort to explore their needs from a different angle, the students were asked to focus on what advice they would give to other U.K. students about to study abroad. The thinking here was that encouraging students to reflect on advice to others might provide an alternative lens on needs by highlighting issues considered by students to play a central role in supporting their experiences. In this way, issues and strategies identified might thus be considered to be at the very heart of their needs. Their responses were broadly reflective of the strategies they had adopted to address their own needs, as described earlier, though this time there was an even greater impression of the need to assert their sense of agency by adopting a positive attitude and outlook and through proactive social engagement.</p>
<p>As many as 60 students identified the need to adopt a range of positive mental behaviors. These were again in line with some of the themes identified above, especially in terms of the need to persevere and practice the psychological technique of letting go:
<disp-quote>
<p>Don’t panic. It will be ok. And when they give you yet another form, ask you for yet another medical certificate, or tell you your bank card won’t be ready for another week, just take a deep breath and go with it—it’ll all get done and you’ll be fine, just rise above it.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Several students pointed out the importance of adopting an attitude that accepted and anticipated difficulties as a natural but usually temporary part of the experience:
<disp-quote>
<p>Be prepared for times when you feel depressed and homesick—they will pass. Don’t think about things too much, live in the present.</p>
<p>Be prepared for culture shock—it does exist, and almost everyone gets it! There will be difficult times when you’re out there, but just know that things will get better.</p>
<p>Expect some confusion and annoyance, especially when you first get there, but remember that things will sort themselves out, no matter how reluctant/scared/homesick/intimidated you feel.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Others highlighted the need to adopt a mindset that was open to new things:
<disp-quote>
<p>Be as open-minded as possible—do things that are different from what you’re used to—realize you’ve got nothing to lose.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Alongside comments like these underlining the need to adopt a positive individual mindset, 45 other responses highlighted the importance of active social participation; this was perceived as key in fulfilling a range of sociocultural and integrational needs, as well as in some cases academic ones:
<disp-quote>
<p>Get stuck in—enjoying your experience on a social level will improve your academic experience.</p>
<p>Try as much as possible to go out and meet new people, go visit new places, etc., as the more you do the less time you will have to mope!</p>
<p>Join a club or sport, try and find a job, find out what’s happening in your area, and just put as much effort as you can into meeting people to help you get through it.</p>
<p>Just get out there and enjoy it, integrate into the other culture, you’ll meet some great people, just open your eyes, have fun, and take every opportunity for every activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The importance of socializing is clearly acknowledged by many students, though there was some disagreement in terms of who students should befriend. For some, making friends with local students was seen as a more effective way of integrating in the country of residence and enriching their experience overall; for others, socializing with other U.K. or international students was considered more expedient in overcoming homesickness and supporting immediate social needs. The few students who commented on maintaining social links with family and friends at home all echoed the potential dangers mentioned before:
<disp-quote>
<p>Limit how much you communicate with home, especially if you are in a different time zone. I met a girl who had to speak to her boyfriend every night on Skype and it really messed up her social life. Don’t plan for your family/friends to come and visit you until you are settled, and DON’T GO INITIALLY WITH YOUR FAMILY, it’ll stop you from meeting people.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Finally, 19 students gave advice of an essentially practical nature, focusing on such issues as the need to save, careful budgeting while abroad, prior orientation visits, and the importance of trying to learn at least something of the local language.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Before considering any conclusions, the limitations of the study need to be acknowledged. Clearly, the insights discussed here have been generated by a single data collection instrument; follow-up interview data, for example, would have been useful in confirming and developing some of the themes discussed in the article. Furthermore, the self-selective and relatively homogeneous (in terms of key demographic details) nature of the sample may mean that the potentially divergent opinions of nonparticipating students have been silenced here. It is hoped that the reasonably large and cross-institutional nature of the sample has at least gone some way toward improving the study’s validity, however. Notwithstanding these limitations, a number of issues for individual and institutional practice can be identified.</p>
<p>In relation to the first research question, the U.K. students predictably express a similar range of needs to other groups of international students discussed in other studies. As discussed earlier, the prominence of their academic needs may to some extent be a function of the disjuncture between their motivation to <italic>be</italic> abroad and <italic>study</italic> abroad but is still worth noting. In any event, it would be useful to encourage students to engage in a predeparture reflective group exercise on their study abroad motivations, as this may help them to define more precisely and clearly which particular needs may be more important for them once abroad. In this way, they can begin to consider strategies in advance. As for social support, reliance on technology as a way of sustaining remote social networks is noted by several students as something of an obstacle in meeting integrational and adjustment needs and is certainly an issue that HEIs could draw attention to as part of predeparture preparation. The same could be said for the relative merits and demerits of bonding attempts with conationals/Erasmus peers as against local students, as signaled by the findings here. Although it is hard to form any definitive guidelines based on the data in this respect, alerting students to these different perspectives may inform their own thinking and behavior when abroad.</p>
<p>The disparities perceived by some students between home and host HEI support approaches suggest the importance of an explicit discussion of institutional support policies between study abroad coordinators, in the interests of greater transparency and the (more) effective/realistic management of student expectations. The importance of this is perhaps further highlighted by the fact that the participants’ responses here suggest their dissatisfaction arises from what they believe to be insufficient support from the home/host HEI rather than from a lack of awareness of support availability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311436085">Sovic, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As for the second research question, it would appear that the majority of students (about two thirds) felt that their needs were met. Although this is a welcome finding, it is somewhat unsettling that a third of the respondents expressed the opposite view, particularly in light of the possibility raised in the introduction that dissatisfied returners may themselves become additional deterrents to prospective study abroad sojourners. This finding again highlights the importance of our attempts to understand, anticipate, and manage student needs and expectations in this domain. In relation to Research Question 3, this finding also raises questions about the effectiveness of the strategies adopted by students in endeavoring to address their needs. Given the large number of responses here that identify self-direction and self-reliance as strategies (including 32 out of the 36 students who suggested their needs were not met), the self-efficacy of these students is itself thus perhaps called into question, highlighting the usefulness of offering predeparture self-efficacy training, drawing perhaps on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1028315311436085">Bandura’s (1995)</xref> quadrapartite model of self-efficacy sources. Such sessions might usefully be organized in conjunction with university counseling services. This point also prompts a much broader question, however. Because several studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1028315311436085">Deacon, 2011</xref>) identify low levels of self-esteem and self-confidence as barriers to U.K. student mobility, as discussed in the Introduction, the challenge may be to consider ways in which U.K. HEIs can actively develop and support the personal and social agency of <italic>all</italic> their students, in an attempt to widen student participation in study abroad schemes, and indeed realize the rhetoric of the global graduate citizen that pervades current U.K. higher education discourses. Further research on strategies and approaches that support student development in these important respects would therefore be useful areas to pursue. The importance respondents here attached to proactive social participation abroad additionally suggests the important role hosting institutions could play in identifying and publicizing relevant local opportunities for international students.</p>
<p>Finally, and reflecting more generally on the findings, it is interesting to return to the strength of the students’ beliefs in the importance of personal and social agency, especially when dealing with a range of affective challenges and needs, and regardless of the extent to which they are able to optimize their self-efficacy. There would appear to be very little evidence here of victimized self-constructions or a sense of diminished capacity when abroad; there are far more expressions of an awareness that difficult experiences—and needs that sometimes remain unfulfilled—are often implicated in personal growth processes. Although such perceptions may be the product of hindsight in some or many cases, this aspect may prove to be an additionally useful discussion point in predeparture/induction programs. In the words of one of the respondents,
<disp-quote>
<p>It is hard to know how you’ll deal with things and what you’ll need in advance really—you just have to go through it, experience it, and come out the other side as a slightly different person.</p>
