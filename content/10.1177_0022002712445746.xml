<abstract>
<p>Two studies examined the effects of guilt and shame on coping with situations of interpersonal conflict. The first study used quantitative self-report measures to evaluate the relationship between guilt-proneness and shame-proneness and conflict coping style. The second study content-analyzed participants’ narrative reports of interpersonal conflicts to evaluate the distinguishing characteristics of guilt versus shame, and the causal relationship between state guilt and shame and styles of coping with conflict. Findings highlight the characteristics of guilt and shame that may explain their differential influence on coping. Theoretical contributions and applications for conflict resolution and mediation are discussed.</p>

<p>In recent years, conflict research has recognized that personal styles of coping with conflict play a decisive role in determining the process and outcome of interpersonal conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022002712445746">Deutsch 2000</xref>). This research has mainly focused on the personality and situational variables that influence interactants’ choices of different conflict coping styles. In contrast, the present study addresses emotional factors, which have only recently begun to garner attention as significant players in conflict and its outcome. The study focuses on the emotions of guilt and shame, which play a central role in conflict and crisis situations.</p>

<title>Styles of Coping with Conflict</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022002712445746">Blake and Mouton (1964</xref>) were among the first researchers to suggest a conceptual scheme for categorizing different styles of coping with conflict, a model later elaborated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022002712445746">Thomas (1976</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712445746">Rahim (1983)</xref>. The styles in the model derive from a combination of two measures, <italic>concern for self</italic> (the degree to which a person tries to achieve his or her personal goals) and <italic>concern for other</italic> (the degree to which a person tries to satisfy the other, meet the other’s needs, and preserve a positive relationship with him or her; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022002712445746">Blake and Mouton 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022002712445746">Rahim and Bonoma 1979</xref>). Different combinations of these two measures predict five distinct styles of coping with conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712445746">Rahim 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022002712445746">Johnson and Johnson 1996</xref>): (1) the <italic>competing style</italic> is characterized by high concern for self and low concern for others and promotes a “win–lose” power dynamic between the two sides; (2) the <italic>obliging style</italic> is characterized by high concern for others and low concern for self, tending to prioritize others’ needs and preserve positive relations with them; (3) the <italic>integrating style</italic> expresses high concern for both self and other and attempts to find innovative, mutual solutions that will meet the needs of both sides; (4) the <italic>compromising style</italic> represents moderate concern for self and others and seeks to resolve the conflict by meeting the other side halfway; (5) and the <italic>avoiding style</italic> is characterized by low concern for self and others; proponents of this style tend to withdraw from conflict and avoid coping with it directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712445746">Rahim 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>This repertoire of styles was elaborated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022002712445746">Ting-Toomey et al. (2000</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022002712445746">Ting-Toomey and Oetzel (2001</xref>), who added three styles to Rahim’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712445746">1983</xref>) model: two styles characterized by general emotional orientation—<italic>emotional style</italic> (the tendency to rely on emotions in the course of coping with conflict) and <italic>neglect</italic> (coping characterized by passive–aggressive responses)—and one style characterized by strategy—the <italic>third-party style</italic> (seeking help from a third party to resolve the conflict). Emotional style entails the capacity to recognize the emotions of oneself and others, and thus integrates concern for others and concern for self. The neglect style expresses high self-concern and low concern for other.</p>
<p>In seeking to understand why people choose particular coping styles over others during conflict, some studies have emphasized the centrality of situational characteristics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022002712445746">Putnam and Poole 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022002712445746">Utley, Richardson, and Pilkington 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022002712445746">Wilmot and Hocker 2001</xref>), while others have underscored the importance of personality (Kilman and Thomas 1975; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022002712445746">Sternberg and Soriano 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022002712445746">Antonioni 1998</xref>). Only recently has the field of conflict resolution turned to view emotions as comparably weighty factors influencing peoples’ behavior in conflict (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022002712445746">Barry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022002712445746">Barry, Smithy-Fulmer, and Goates 2006</xref>). Early research in this vein focused on mood and general affect (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022002712445746">Carnavale and Isen 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022002712445746">Forgas 1998</xref>); in the past decade, more studies have begun to focus on distinct emotions. Still, most studies in the field of conflict resolution focus on negotiation scenarios rather than on interpersonal conflict and attend to a narrow range of emotions—primarily anger (e.g., Friedman et al. 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022002712445746">Van Dijk et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022002712445746">Van Kleef, De Dreu, and Manstead 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022002712445746">Van Kleef 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66a-0022002712445746">Van Kleef and Van Lange 2008</xref>). The present study addresses these gaps by examining the roles played by guilt and shame in interpersonal conflict situations.</p>

<title>Guilt, Shame, and Styles of Coping with Conflict</title>
<p>The emotions of guilt and shame are significant to regulating moral behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022002712445746">Tangney 1996</xref>). These feelings invoke heightened self-awareness and distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712445746">Tangney and Dearing 2002</xref>) and usually arise in interpersonal contexts, following wrongdoing or injury that threaten a personal relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002712445746">Tangney 1995</xref>). Guilt and shame also influence how individuals cope with relationship difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022002712445746">Covert et al. 2003</xref>). Thus, while no studies have verified the claim, it is likely that guilt and shame also influence the coping styles that people will employ during interpersonal conflict.</p>
<p>Guilt and shame are two distinct emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712445746">Lewis 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42a-0022002712445746">Tangney 1991</xref>). While shame centers on the global self (“who I am”), guilt addresses a particular action committed (“what I did”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712445746">Lewis 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42a-0022002712445746">Tangney 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002712445746">Lindsay-Hartz, De-Rivera, and Mascolo 1995</xref>). People who feel guilty experience less emotional distress and anxiety then those who feel shame and focus more on the implications of their actions on others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022002712445746">Tangney and Dearing 2000</xref>). These thoughts and feelings motivate a person who feels guilty to ameliorate their predicament by confessing, apologizing, or otherwise repairing the damage done. Conversely, people who experience shame feel more threatened than those who experience guilt and are more concerned about others’ negative evaluations of them. Responses to shame can range from directing anger, aggression, and blame toward other person, to avoiding the other and directing anger toward oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022002712445746">Barret 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022002712445746">Tangney et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712445746">Leith and Baumeisrer 1998</xref>; Lewis 2000; Steinberg 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712445746">Tangney and Dearing 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Another distinction between guilt and shame, regarding which there is some disagreement in the literature, centers on the factor of public exposure: some view shame as an emotion that hinges on public exposure of a socially unacceptable act or injury, while guilt is privately harbored following a possibly inconspicuous violation of internal norms (Gehm &amp; Sherer, 1988; in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712445746">Tangney &amp; Dearing, 2002</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022002712445746">R. Smith et al. (2002</xref>) found that public exposure is not a necessary precondition for the arousal of shame, but that such exposure does increase shame’s intensity. Other studies have failed to find empirical support for the distinction between guilt and shame on the basis of public exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002712445746">Tangney, 1992</xref>; Tangney et al. 1996a).</p>
<p>Guilt plays a prosocial function in strengthening relationships: it encourages taking responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002712445746">Tangney et al. 1992</xref>), motivates amendatory behaviors such as apology or confession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022002712445746">Baumeister, Reis, and Delespaul 1995</xref>), leads to higher-quality solutions to crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022002712445746">Covert et al. 2003</xref>), is associated with more constructive anger management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022002712445746">Tangney, Miller, et al. 1996</xref>; Lutwak et al. 2001), and is a mechanism that controls and inhibits actions that are likely to cause harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022002712445746">Baumeister, Reis, and Delespaul 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Guilt is also associated with positive empathy and the ability to acknowledge and understand others’ points of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002712445746">Tangney et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022002712445746">Baumeister, Sillwell, and Heatherton 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712445746">Leith and Baumeisrer 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022002712445746">Tangney, Mashek, and Stuewig 2007</xref>). In contrast, shame is associated with responses that are injurious to social relationships: Shame arouses anger, suspicion, and resentment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002712445746">Tangney et al. 1992</xref>) and is associated with expressions of hostility and aggression toward the self, the other, or the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002712445746">Tangney et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002712445746">Tangney 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022002712445746">Tangney et al. 1996</xref>; Lutwak et al. 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002712445746">Lutwak, Panish, and Ferrari 2003</xref>). Shame is also associated with fear of intimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002712445746">Lutwak et al. 2003</xref>). These correlates of shame encourage nonconstructive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712445746">Leith and Baumeisrer 1998</xref>), withdrawal, avoidance of coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712445746">Tangney 1990</xref>), lower-quality solutions to problems, and reduced expectations of carrying out such solutions effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022002712445746">Covert et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding the unique characteristics of each emotion, we can expect that guilt (both as a personal trait and as a state emotion) would be accompanied by high concern for other and by the ability to take personal responsibility for the progression of the conflict and will lead to the use of the more cooperative coping styles integration, compromise, and emotional. Contrarily, shame (both as a personal trait and as a state emotion) will be accompanied by greater concern for self, and by a sense of exposure to the other, and will lead to the use of noncooperative coping styles: competition, neglect, avoidance, and obliging.</p>

<sec id="section3-0022002712445746">
<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>The central purpose of this study was to reveal how guilt and shame (both as personal traits and as state emotions) are related to styles of coping with conflict, and which unique characteristics of guilt and shame may contribute to this relationship. We hypothesized that guilt will lead to the use of the cooperative coping styles of integration, compromise, and emotional, which take into account concern for mutual relationships and which integrate between the needs of the self and the needs of the other. In contrast, shame will lead to the use of noncooperative coping styles: competition, neglect, avoidance, and obliging,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022002712445746">1</xref>
</sup> which do not express concern for the needs of the other. Regarding the deciding characteristics of each emotion, we hypothesized that guilt would be associated with greater concern for the other and with the capacity to take personal responsibility for the progression of conflict, whereas shame would be associated with greater concern for self, and with a sense of exposure to the other.</p>
<p>In order to test the hypotheses, we carried out two studies: study 1, a quantitative study, which assessed the relationship between proneness to guilt and shame and style of coping with conflict (integrative, comprising, obliging, avoidant, neglect, competitive, and emotional) using paper-and-pencil measures. We hypothesized that
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>guilt-proneness would be positively correlated with the use of the cooperative coping styles, and shame-proneness would be positively correlated with the use of the noncooperative coping styles.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Study 2 reassessed the relationships between guilt, shame, (this time as a state emotion), and coping styles using the qualitative, personal narratives of participants, in order to evaluate the causal relationship between them and to isolate the unique characteristics of guilt and shame that can explain their relationship. The use of narratives made it possible to draw conclusions regarding causality, as the narratives were controlled for the chronological order in which variables appeared. To this end, participants were asked to describe an interpersonal conflict that aroused a sense of guilt/shame and to note their manner of coping with that conflict. Since the conflict (including the emotion it aroused) preceded coping, it can be concluded that the emotion (guilt or shame) led to participants’ manner of coping, and not the reverse. Hypotheses were that
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>state guilt will be characterized by greater concern for other and greater personal responsibility, and by less sense of exposure, while state shame will be characterized by greater concern for self and sense of exposure, and by less personal responsibility.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>cooperative coping will be characterized by greater concern for other and greater personal responsibility, whereas noncooperative coping will be characterized by greater concern for self and sense of exposure.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>One hundred female and ninety-nine male undergraduate students at an Israeli liberal arts university were paid to take part in the study.

<sec id="section6-0022002712445746">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The study was carried out in group sessions of ten participants, lasting about twenty minutes each. At the start of the session, the experimenter explained that the participants would be taking part in a study on coping and interpersonal conflict. Each participant received a file containing three questionnaires, which they were asked to complete anonymously. Each questionnaire also contained detailed completion instructions. At the close of the session, participants were paid and thanked for their participation.</p>

<sec id="section8-0022002712445746">
<title>Test of self-conscious affect</title>
<p>In order to evaluate guilt- and shame-proneness, we culled items from the guilt and shame indices of the Test of Self-Conscious Affect-3 (TOSCA-3) questionnaire, which was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022002712445746">Tangney et al. (2000</xref>) and translated to Hebrew for the purposes of the present study by two psychologists. Questionnaire items ask participants to indicate the likelihood they would experience certain emotions following a given scenario. For example, for the scenario “At work, you wait until the last minute to plan a project, and it turns out badly,” shame is scored on participants’ response to the option “You would feel incompetent,” and guilt is scored on the option “You would feel: I deserve to be reprimanded for mismanaging the project.” For each option, participants rate the likelihood their feelings would match those described on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>highly unlikely</italic>) to 5 (<italic>highly likely</italic>). Average guilt and shame scores were calculated for each participant, with higher scores indicating stronger guilt/shame.</p>
<p>Because the scenarios that comprise the TOSCA-3 are narratively complex, we pretested the translation three separate times on a total of 219 participants, amending the wording between each pretest. The final version of the questionnaire yielded an internal consistency of Cronbach’s α = .63 for guilt and α = .77 for shame.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022002712445746">
<title>Styles of coping with conflict questionnaire</title>
<p>To identify the coping styles that participants employ during conflict, we used the Negotiation Strategy Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712445746">Reisman 2006</xref>). This questionnaire was chosen because it includes both the five styles from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712445746">Rahim’s (1983)</xref> coping model (integrative, compromising, competitive, avoidant, and obliging) and the two styles from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022002712445746">Ting-Toomey et al. (2000</xref>) model (neglect and emotional).</p>
<p>The questionnaire contains forty-six items assessing the extent to which participants use each of the seven different styles of coping with conflict. For each item, participants must rate their agreement on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>totally untrue</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very true</italic>). Scores were averaged for each participant, with higher scores indicating that the participant’s coping strategy is more greatly characterized by that style.</p>
<p>Principal component analysis of the questionnaire results using Varimax rotation corroborated the existence of seven distinct coping styles (factors) which together explained 64 percent of the variance. These styles were <italic>Obliging</italic> (7 items, α = .90; e.g., I give in to others even on issues that are important to me in order to prevent discomfort), <italic>Competitive</italic> (7 items, α = .86; e.g., My aim is to get as much as I can. The aims of the other person don’t concern me), <italic>Integrative</italic> (7 items, α = .84; e.g., I cooperate with the other person in order to find a creative solution that will completely satisfy both of us), <italic>Emotional</italic> (6 items, α = .84; e.g., In order to convince the other side of my position I turn also to his or her heart and feelings), <italic>Compromise</italic> (6 items, α = .75; e.g., I try to find the middle ground between what I want to achieve and what the other person wants), <italic>Avoidance</italic> (7 items, α = .81; e.g., I do everything to avoid exchanging harsh words with the other person), and <italic>Neglect</italic> (6 items, α = .82; e.g., When I’m dissatisfied, I don’t say so explicitly, but I make biting comments to the other person).</p>

Likewise, hypotheses regarding shame-proneness were only partially corroborated: shame-proneness positively correlated with the obliging, avoidant, and neglect styles but revealed no significant relationships with the other styles (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002712445746">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<sec id="section15-0022002712445746">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Fifty-three participants, recruited by snowball method, participated in the study, of them twenty-three men and thirty-one women, ages ranged from twenty-one to fifty-three years (<italic>M</italic> = 28, <italic>SD</italic> = 7). Participation was unpaid.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022002712445746">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Study 2 was carried out in one-on-one sessions lasting fifteen to twenty-five minutes. We used the qualitative method of respondent narrative as accustomed in shame and guilt research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022002712445746">Baumeister, Sillwell, and Wotman 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712445746">Tangney and Dearing, 2002</xref>). The use of participants’ narratives enables depth insights regarding the participants’ emotional experiences and their respective meanings. These powerful emotional experiences are difficult to manipulate in a lab study. Participants were told that they would be assisting a study on interpersonal conflict and were ensured confidentiality. At the beginning of the session, participants were asked the open question, “Try to recall a conflict you experienced with someone that caused you to feel guilt/shame.” Participants were randomly assigned to either the guilt or the shame condition and were asked to describe the incident in writing as clearly and with as much detail as possible, addressing such points as their relationship with the other person and the context of the confrontation. Definitions of the terms “guilt” and “shame” were not provided, so as to preserve the participants’ organic understanding and emotional experiences.</p>
<p>After the narratives were collected, we preassessed their content in three stages: (1) a manipulation check verified the efficacy of the guilt versus shame manipulation, (2) participants’ coping styles were identified, and (3) the phenomenological characteristics of guilt and shame—concern for self versus concern for other, personal responsibility, and sense of exposure—were scored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0022002712445746">
<title>Manipulation check</title>
<p>Two external judges having master’s degrees in Conflict Resolution and Negotiation verified that the narratives addressed guilt versus shame. The judges were asked to assess each narrative according to such distinguishing criteria as participants’ focus of self-awareness, degree of distress, self-projections, and motivational characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712445746">Tangney and Dearing 2002</xref>). Variations on the words “guilt” and “shame” were erased from the narratives before they were externally judged, and narratives were only retained if both judges agreed with emotion they represented. Accordingly, one narrative was omitted from the study and another five narratives were recategorized from “shame” to “guilt.” This gave thirty-three shame narratives and twenty guilt narratives for analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0022002712445746">
<title>Categorizing styles of coping with conflict</title>
<p>Participants’ narratives of their conflict experiences were categorized into distinct coping styles by two undergraduate psychology majors. Due to the limited number of coping styles represented in the sample, and following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022002712445746">Putnam and Wilson (1982</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002712445746">Brew and Cairns (2004</xref>), styles were consolidated into three categories: (1) <italic>Withdrawn</italic> coping included the obliging, neglect, and avoidant styles, which share an indirect, evasive approach to dealing with conflict; (2) <italic>Cooperative</italic> coping included the integrative style, characterized by action, open communication, and concern for the preservation of relationships; and (3) <italic>Competitive</italic> coping included the competing style, which is characterized by directness, prioritization of own interests, control, and advantage over the other side.</p>
<p>The consolidation of styles into three categories is accepted in the literature and, in particular, the merging of the obliging, neglect, and avoidant styles into the “withdrawn” category is supported by study 1, which found that these styles shared the same pattern of relationships with guilt and shame. In case of disagreement, a judgment of a third judge, a professor in social psychology, determined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0022002712445746">
<title>Scoring the phenomenological characteristics of guilt and shame</title>
<p>Three judges, undergraduate psychology majors, assessed whether the following distinguishing characteristics of guilt and shame were present in participants’ narratives: (1) concern for other versus concern for self—was the participant troubled by the implications of his actions on the other person or was his narrative mostly occupied with his own needs and distress? (2) personal responsibility—did the narrative express the participant’s sense of responsibility for contributing to the conflict? (3) sense of exposure—was the participant troubled that uncomplimentary qualities or behaviors would be revealed to others? Judges assessed the characteristics on a yes/no basis and only characteristics on which there was full agreement were retained in the study.</p>

<p>Overall, frequencies of coping differed between guilt and shame (χ<sup>2</sup> = 20.54, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In accordance with our hypotheses, cooperative coping was more frequent in guilt than in shame, and the (noncooperative) competitive and withdrawn coping styles were more frequent in shame than in guilt.</p>

<sec id="section22-0022002712445746">
<title>Guilt and cooperative coping</title>
<p>As hypothesized, conflict experiences that evoked guilt brought about greater use of cooperative coping than those that that evoked shame. A number of participants related how the sense of guilt aroused by the conflict brought them to adopt a more empathic and understanding approach to the other side, as described by one participant whose friend had not returned a debt on time:
<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Due to the incident</italic> I developed a more <italic>empathic and supportive approach</italic> to my friend and I’m not too tough on him anymore. Instead, <italic>I reached a certain compromise</italic> with him that if he can’t meet his financial obligations to me, that he just update me and let me know that he needs a few more days and <italic>I will be totally understanding and attentive</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0022002712445746">
<title>Shame and competitive coping</title>
<p>More than half of the participants who described an experience of shame exhibited competitive coping. Content analysis indicated that competitiveness often arose as a way to protect the threatened self and to overcome a sense of helplessness and lack of control. For example, a participant described feeling attacked by a boss at work:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the forum of the entire group I was forced to tell her that I couldn’t fulfill the task since the allotted time wasn’t reasonable. She claimed that it was a simple task . . . I felt that she was <italic>cornering</italic> me and that in any case I wouldn’t come out of this conversation looking good . . . My sense was that it was <italic>her word against mine</italic> . . . I felt small and rather helpless. This situation made me <italic>feel ashamed</italic> because I felt that my credibility was being called into question . . . <italic>I responded angrily, I tried to explain why</italic>, given the existing pressure, I wouldn’t be able to keep up with the schedule anyway.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0022002712445746">
<title>Shame and withdrawn coping</title>
<p>Thirty-percent of shame narratives indicated withdrawn coping. Content analysis indicated that withdrawn coping often arose in cases in which the participant reports feelings of helplessness and distress which unable him to take action. For example, a participant described how she responded to a harsh reprimand by her boss:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>I didn’t have answers to the questions</italic> he asked so I felt <italic>shame</italic> . . . I stopped my tears . . . and <italic>I didn’t even try to provide an explanation</italic> for the questions I did have an answer to. About two days after the same conversation I couldn’t concentrate at work and I felt that I had lost some of the estimation he’d had for me. Afterwards <italic>I asked him to take me off the case</italic> . . . and he refused.</p>

<p>Content analysis of guilt experiences showed that concern for other took the form of empathy for the other person’s situation and a motivation to better understand the other side. For example, “It’s possible that my sense of guilt <italic>derived from the fact that I hadn’t been able to understand how difficult his financial situation was</italic> . . . <italic>I had to show more understanding</italic>.” Concern for the other was also expressed in recurring thoughts about the distress and injury caused to the other person. A participant describes a conflict with her father when he opposed her taking part in a political action in the Occupied Territories:
<disp-quote>
<p>I felt a deep sense of guilt that I was making my father worry, that he wouldn’t be able to sleep at night because of me. I had thoughts that I was hurting my father badly, that he would feel anxious and worried because of my insistence on carrying out the trip, which could be dangerous. Since my mother passed way, anxieties about another death in the family were difficult for every member of the family.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In experiences of shame, concern for self was expressed in a sense of helplessness, threat, and in troubling thoughts about lack of self-worth. For example, a participant described her feelings when a teacher wrongly accused her of an act of misbehavior: “I felt <italic>shame</italic> (it was in front of the whole class), <italic>helplessness</italic>, <italic>frustration</italic>, because I truly hadn’t lied and still she . . . disbelieved me of all people, even though I was blameless.” Another participant describes what she felt during a conflict with a work colleague: “I felt a<italic>shamed for my outburst and for not being able to ‘keep my cool’ and stay in control</italic>.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0022002712445746">
<title>Personal responsibility</title>
<p>As hypothesized, participants who described guilt experiences demonstrated more personal responsibility than those who described shame (χ<sup>2</sup> = 25.76, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). An example of taking personal responsibility comes from the narrative of a participant whose criticism of a friend almost cost their friendship:
<disp-quote>
<p>I felt a guilty about the situation we'd gotten ourselves into, since I said to myself, maybe I’m the one who brought matters to their present situation, because of how I’d treated her. Maybe I’d been impatient and hadn’t expressed myself aptly. I understood that the problem was with my approach and I took on my mistake.</p>

<sec id="section28-0022002712445746">
<title>Sense of exposure</title>
<p>Chi-square analyses revealed that shame narratives contained more descriptions of exposure than guilt narratives (χ<sup>2</sup> = 13.61, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Often, exposure—especially in front of others—is the very reason for feeling powerless and ashamed (“it was in front of the whole class,” “in the forum of the entire group”).

For example, a participant described being angry at his parents because they had not come to visit him. His sense of guilt was aroused alongside great concern for his parents, which led to cooperative coping:<disp-quote>
<p>The sense of guilt arose a few days later when I considered other parameters. <italic>My father is about to retire . . . any trip like that would be exhausting for him</italic> . . .

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022002712445746">Bodtker and Jameson (2001</xref>, 270) claimed that “conflict is a fundamentally emotionally created and driven process” and that acknowledging this fact necessarily changes how people cope with conflict. This statement encapsulates the fundamental assumption of this article, which places supreme value on recognizing the emotions that arise in the course of conflict and their influence on manner of coping. Specifically, this study illustrates the salutary influence of guilt, both as a personal trait and as a state emotion, on cooperative coping, and the relatively detrimental influence of shame. The research findings support the widespread view of guilt as an adaptive and prosocial emotion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-0022002712445746">
<title>Guilt, shame, and coping with conflict</title>
<p>Guilt, both as a personal trait (study 1) and as a state emotion (study 2), is positively related (study 1) and leads (study 2) to a cooperative–integrative coping style, whereas shame is related and leads to noncooperative coping with conflict—obliging, avoidance, and neglect. The latter findings diverges from the dominant view in the literature that obliging is a philanthropic style that expresses high concern for relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022002712445746">Thomas (1992</xref>), for example, describes this style as a tendency to generosity that approaches self-sacrifice for the sake of the other’s needs and for keeping relationships intact. Our findings on the positive relationship between shame and obliging suggest that obliging derives more from the self-contempt that taints shame experiences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002712445746">Lutwak, et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022002712445746">Tangney, Miller, et al. 1996</xref>) than from high concern for the other. The findings of study 2, which showed that shame is characterized by low concern for the other and high concern for the self, also support this claim.</p>
<p>With respect to the relationship between shame and competitive coping, we came upon contradictory findings: no significant relationship between shame-proneness and competitive coping in study 1, but a significant positive relationship between state shame and competitive coping in study 2. Since shame experiences heighten emotional distress and self-concern, which can lead to defensiveness and hostility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022002712445746">Tangney, Miller, et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712445746">Leith and Baumeisrer 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712445746">Tangney and Dearing 2002</xref>), we hypothesized that shame, both as a personal trait and as a state emotion, would be related to and invoke a competitive approach to coping. Possibly, methodological differences between the two studies made measurement tools attuned to divergent aspects of the competitive style. In the first study, competitive coping was assessed using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712445746">Reisman’s (2006)</xref> self-report questionnaire, based on the questionnaire by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712445746">Rahim (1983)</xref>; these measures frame concern for self at the expense of concern for others as part of a mode of assertiveness and control (I try to make the other person understand that he or she doesn’t have a choice but to accept my position as is, and To achieve my aims, I put heavy pressure on the other side.) In contrast, the more nuanced qualitative analysis of study 2 conveyed the lack of efficacy that arises with shame, which was often experienced alongside a distinct loss of control (e.g., Out of my confusion and embarrassment, I started to attack). Taken together, these findings show that while shame can heighten self-concern at the expense of others, the resultant competitive approach can either seem active (arising from a sense of control, as in study 1) or defensive (study 2). Further research may substantiate this distinction, possibly integrating it into existing measures so as to separately gauge the two different kinds of competitive coping.</p>
<p>Another contradiction to our hypotheses was that guilt-proneness did not positively correlate with the use of the compromising style. The compromising and integrative styles are commonly joined under the “cooperative” heading, as both styles require integrating one’s own needs with the needs of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712445746">Rahim 1983</xref>). We did find a positive correlation between guilt-proneness and integration, but not between guilt-proneness and compromising. Possibly the compromising style, compared to the integrative, is more pragmatic than empathic and other-oriented. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022002712445746">van de Vliert and Hordijk (1989)</xref> view compromise as a distributive strategy that requires only concern for self. While integration is a creative practice that requires a deep understanding of the needs of all involved, the concessions that make up compromise solutions can be calculated in the interior, regardless of one’s awareness of the needs of the other party (Walton and McKerise 1965; in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022002712445746">van de Vliert and Hordijk 1989</xref>).</p>

<title>Phenomenological characteristics of guilt versus shame</title>
<p>The qualitative analysis in this study broadens the prevailing distinction between state guilt and shame as based on global (shame) or action-specific (guilt) self-awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712445746">Tangney and Dearing 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022002712445746">Tangney, Mashek and Stuewig 2007</xref>). We found that participants who experienced guilt reported greater concern for others, whereas those who experienced shame reported greater concern for themselves. These findings accord with the knowledge that guilt-proneness entails high empathic ability and emotional openness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002712445746">Tangney et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022002712445746">Baumeister, Sillwell, and Heatherton 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002712445746">Tangney 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712445746">Leith and Baumeisrer 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712445746">Tangney and Dearing 2002</xref>) and parallel the customary distinction between empathy, which is centered on the other, and distress responses, which are focused on the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002712445746">Davis 1983</xref>). Empathy is generally accepted as a positive, moral attribute that makes it possible for one to experience a wide range of emotions, to view things from another’s perspective and to read others’ emotional state (for a broader discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002712445746">Tangney 1995</xref>); this ability was evident in narratives about guilt. Sense of threat, self-concern, and low self-worth accord with what is known about experiences that entail distress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42a-0022002712445746">Tangney 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002712445746">1995</xref>, ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712445746">Tangney and Dearing 2002</xref>); these were often evident in narratives about shame.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we found that guilt experiences more often brought participants to take personal responsibility for their part in a conflict than shame experiences, and that sense of exposure was common in shame experiences but absent in guilt experiences. This finding is particularly relevant to the existing disagreement in the literature regarding whether sense of exposure is a characteristic that distinguishes guilt from shame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022002712445746">Smith et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022002712445746">Wicker, Payne, and Morgan 1983</xref>). Our study provides empirical support for the view that sense of exposure is a significant part of the experience of shame, but not of the experience of guilt.</p>
<p>The characteristics found to distinguish between guilt and shame may shed light on the adaptivity of guilt versus shame as encouraging cooperative versus noncooperative coping. Cooperative coping was more frequent in narratives that expressed concern for other and personal responsibility—significant characteristics of guilt—while noncooperative coping was more frequent in narratives that expressed concern for self and sense of exposure—significant characteristics of shame. It is possible that these qualities not only characterize guilt and shame but that they also mediate between those emotions and the coping styles people chose. While the sample size did not permit such an analysis, future studies can pursue this hypothesis.</p>

<title>Contributions and Applications</title>
<p>This study creates an interdisciplinary connection between the field of conflict studies (coping styles) and the psychology of emotions (guilt and shame). This accords with the growing tendency among psychology researchers to take an integrative approach to the study of phenomena in their field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022002712445746">Smith, Murphy, and Coats 1999</xref>). Methodologically, the study also integrates between qualitative and quantitative approaches in the study of conflict. This expresses the view that interpersonal conflicts are complex phenomena that require attention to the emotions, feelings, and actions that accompany it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022002712445746">Bell and Song 2005</xref>). Here, qualitative experiences, which examine organic conflict situation, bring texture and contextual validity, on one hand, and validate the correlative findings on the other. In addition, the qualitative experiences enable to conclude causal correlation based on the narrative chronological order. However, we should note that the causality is weaker in comparison to experimental manipulation due to memory problems and subjective information processing.</p>
<p>The study responds to the lack of research on distinct emotions in interpersonal conflict context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66a-0022002712445746">Van Kleef and Van Lange 2008</xref>) and extends the little available research, which focuses mainly on primal emotions such as fear and anger, by providing findings on the role of two specific self-conscious emotions, guilt, and shame. In addition, the study detailed the particular characteristics of guilt and shame experiences that can serve as points of strength in working toward constructive coping. These emotions, unlike primary emotions, entails activation of complex cognitive processes and therefore can act as a major pillar in constructive conflict coping</p>
<p>In particular, the study exposes the potentially positive implications of guilt, typically considered a negative emotion—concern for other and taking personal responsibility. This positive orientation accords with a growing trend in psychology toward positive humanistic psychology, which focuses on peoples’ points of strength as resources that can be nurtured and harnessed for better adaptation between people and their surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022002712445746">McCullough and Snyder 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>From an applied perspective, professionals in conflict resolution and mediation processes can use the qualitative distinctions made in this study between guilt and shame experiences in order to identify the emotional state of their clients. This can enable practitioners understand and relate to the core concerns and interests of the parties in a manner that aids their recruitment to a joint process. The capacity to identify shame is especially important in light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002712445746">Retzinger and Scheff’s (2000)</xref> claim that at the base of every intractable conflict lays an implicit, unconscious feeling of shame.</p>
<p>Guilt and shame entail cognitive perceptions and appraisals, and thus are amenable to reframing processes. By redefining their assumptions, parties can be coaxed to view a conflict from a broader perspective and to recenter their position from one of shame (high self-focus and sense of threat and low self-worth) to one of guilt (focus on the act committed and on the other person). When shame is ameliorated, threats may dissipate and sense of control and self-efficacy may be restored. This process will likely raise the sense of self-worth of both sides (empowerment), stimulating mutual acknowledgement and the motivation to effect a positive change.</p>

<title>Recommendations for Further Research</title>
<p>The present study focused on emotions and coping from the perspective of one side of interpersonal conflict—the participant who took part in our study. Today, recognition of the interpersonal function of emotions (e.g., Morris and Keltner 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022002712445746">Van Kleef, De Dreu, and Manstead 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022002712445746">Van Kleef et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022002712445746">Van Dijk et al. 2008</xref>) suggests that expressions of guilt—conveying empathy, taking responsibility, and apologizing—can constructively influence the other side and accelerate reconciliation. Future studies should examine the interpersonal influence of guilt and shame from both sides of a conflict, assessing their impact on the emotions, thoughts, and behaviors of each side and perhaps the subsequent efficacy of reconciliation efforts between them. Possibly, deliberate efforts to evoke guilt may advance cooperative coping between parties; the efficacy of such a strategy, and the potency of guilt that is induced rather than autonomously felt, remain to be assessed.</p>
<p>From the participants’ narratives it seems that guilt experiences were described more often in the context of symmetrical relationships (e.g., couples or friends), whereas shame experiences were described more often in asymmetrical settings (e.g., employer–employee or teacher–student relationships). This difference raises the possibility that state characteristics may influence the type of emotion, shame, or guilt, that arises following interpersonal conflict. The predominant approach in the literature tends to discount the existence of situational differences in inducing guilt versus shame and distinguishes between these emotions primarily on the basis of the role of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002712445746">Tangney, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022002712445746">Tangney, Wagner, et al. 1996</xref>). However, in this study, the coincidence of guilt with symmetrical contexts and shame with asymmetrical contexts raises the question of whether certain objective state differences may distinguish between state guilt and state shame. Future studies should continue to examine this question.</p>
<p>The findings of this study emphasize the important influence of emotions on coping with conflict. While the weight of this study bore on guilt and shame, the narrative experiences of participants revealed that these states were accompanied by an array of other emotions such as anger, regret, and sadness. Future studies may seek to take on a broader range of emotions, examining their interplay on each other and on the conditional elements that can advance more constructive resolutions to interpersonal conflicts.</p>

<p>Although the obliging style can be seen as altruistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022002712445746">Thomas 1976</xref>), we view this style, in contrast to integration or cooperation, as reflecting individuals’ inability to protect their own needs due to the personal distress that characterizes shame.</p>
