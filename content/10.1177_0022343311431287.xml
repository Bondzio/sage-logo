        <p>Contributions to the quantitative civil war literature increasingly rely on
          geo-referenced data and disaggregated research designs. While this is a welcome trend, it
          necessitates geographic information systems (GIS) skills and imposes new challenges for
          data collection and analysis. So far, solutions to these challenges differ between
          studies, obstructing direct comparison of findings and hampering replication and extension
          of earlier work. This article presents a standardized structure for storing, manipulating,
          and analyzing high-resolution spatial data. PRIO-GRID is a vector grid network with a
          resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 decimal degrees, covering all terrestrial areas of the world.
          Gridded data comprise inherently apolitical entities; the grid cells are fixed in time and
          space, they are insensitive to political boundaries and developments, and they are
          completely exogenous to likely features of interest, such as civil war outbreak, ethnic
          settlement patterns, extreme weather events, or the spatial distribution of wealth.
          Moreover, unlike other disaggregated approaches, gridded data may be scaled up or down in
          a consistent manner by varying the resolution of the grid. The released dataset comes with
          cell-specific information on a large selection of political, economic, demographic,
          environmental, and conflict variables for all years, 1946–2008. A simple descriptive data
          assessment of population density and economic activity is offered to demonstrate how
          PRIO-GRID may be applied in quantitative social science research.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>While the quantitative study of armed conflict traditionally is carried out at the country
        level, contemporary empirical work increasingly uses geographic information systems (GIS)
        data to capture conflict dynamics at a subnational level. Recent contributions to the
        disaggregation trend in cross-country research focus on conflict zones (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022343311431287">Braithwaite, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022343311431287">Buhaug &amp; Gates, 2002</xref>), conflict
        events (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022343311431287">O’Loughlin &amp; Witmer,
          2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022343311431287">Raleigh et al.,
          2010</xref>), and conflict onset locations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022343311431287">Braithwaite, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022343311431287">Buhaug, 2010</xref>). Likewise, the habitual unit of analysis
        – the country – is increasingly replaced by grid cells (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022343311431287">Buhaug &amp; Rød, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343311431287">Raleigh &amp; Urdal, 2007</xref>), geographically distinct
        ethnic groups (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022343311431287">Buhaug, Cederman
          &amp; Rød, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022343311431287">Weidmann,
          2009</xref>) or subnational administrative entities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022343311431287">Murshed &amp; Gates, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022343311431287">Østby, Nordås &amp; Rød, 2009</xref>) to better capture
        local variation. In addition, a host of local factors plausibly affecting the risk and
        course of armed conflict have become available in a geo-referenced format, such as
        population size/density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022343311431287">CIESIN,
          2005</xref>), settlement areas of politically relevant ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022343311431287">Wucherpfennig et al., 2011</xref>), economic
        activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343311431287">Nordhaus, 2006</xref>),
        natural resource sites (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022343311431287">Lujala, Rød
          &amp; Thieme, 2007</xref>), and various climate statistics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022343311431287">GPCC, 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>So far, there have been few attempts to coordinate these efforts. As a result, relevant
        datasets come in different formats, with different spatial resolutions, and rely on
        different data structures and coordinate systems (e.g. vector versus raster, point versus
        polygon data, NetCDF versus shapefiles, etc.). Many of these datasets are not easily
        combined and converted to a common unit of analysis. It currently takes in-depth GIS skills
        to be able to exploit the rich data and opportunities offered by disaggregated research
        designs. Most social science scholars do not possess such skills.</p>
      <p>This article presents a solution to the technical challenges incurred by using GIS data.
        PRIO-GRID is a spatio-temporal grid structure constructed to aid the compilation,
        management, and analysis of spatial data within a time-consistent framework. It consists of
        quadratic grid cells that jointly cover all terrestrial areas of the world. The basic
        (static) version of PRIO-GRID contains cell-specific information on a limited selection of
        core variables (e.g. cell ID, cell area, population, and terrain characteristics), which may
        be joined with yearly files containing time-varying information measured specifically for
        each geographic cell (e.g. country code/name, population size, ethnic composition, etc.).
        Although PRIO-GRID was designed with peace and conflict research in mind, its potential
        applicability extends well beyond the study of civil war.</p>
      <p>In the following, we briefly review arguments for when and how spatial disaggregation is
        pertinent and describe how this has been carried out in earlier research. The main content
        of the article is the presentation of PRIO-GRID – its structure, content, and applicability.
        We offer some examples to highlight how PRIO-GRID may be used to investigate new
        location-sensitive questions and offer more precise empirical tests of prevalent theories of
        civil war. We also discuss the prevalence of spatial autocorrelation in geographic data.</p>

      <title>Disaggregation: Motives and solutions</title>
      <p>What causes civil war? Why do some civil wars last longer than others? Such questions have
        been subject to systematic scientific scrutiny for decades. Until recently, however,
        quantitative comparable analyses have been carried out almost exclusively at the level of
        independent states. Consequently, India – with all its geographic, cultural, political, and
        socio-economic facets – is treated as a homogenous entity in exactly the same manner as,
        say, Iceland. This assumption of unit homogeneity may be trivial in some settings but is
        clearly problematic in others. For example, by modeling civil war outbreak as a function of
        gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, country population size, ethno-linguistic
        fractionalization, and other conventional country-level correlates of civil war, we may
        deduce that India is at higher risk of civil war than Iceland, but we are unable to
        understand why only some parts of India have a recent history of violence, much less get
        credible estimates of the local conflict risk. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343311431287">Buhaug &amp; Lujala (2005</xref>) show, there are often
        significant discrepancies between national aggregates and local-level conditions, and
        conflict zones are rarely representative of the country at large. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022343311431287">Cederman &amp; Gleditsch (2009</xref>: 488)
        argue that ‘many of the non-findings and conundrums in the existing cross-national research
        on civil war … follow at least partly from the near exclusive reliance on country-level
        attributes.’</p>
      <p>As a result of advances in technology and data availability, there has been a wave of
        disaggregated conflict studies in recent years, perhaps best epitomized by the special issue
        of the <italic>Journal of Conflict Resolution</italic> on ‘Disaggregating Civil War’ in
        2009. We refer to the introduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022343311431287">Cederman &amp; Gleditsch, 2009</xref>) and subsequent articles in that issue for reviews
        of the earlier literature, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022343311431287">Sambanis
          (2004</xref>) for a critical discussion of limits to country-level research. At this
        stage, we limit ourselves to briefly presenting a few alternative means of disaggregation.<sup>
          <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022343311431287">1</xref>
        </sup>
      </p>
      <p>We can identify three broad departures from the conventional country-level analysis of
        armed conflict. First, a number of recent publications focus on subnational groups and
        actors. For example, the Minorities at Risk project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022343311431287">Gurr, 1993</xref>) has collected data on 283 targeted
        politically active minorities and provides information on organizational structure and
        violent behavior for some of these groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343311431287">Öberg’s (2002)</xref> study of ethnic rebellion introduced a
        link between ethnic groups and rebel organizations, analyzed against a control group of 370
        ethnic groups without an armed agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343311431287">Öberg, 2002</xref>: 97). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022343311431287">Wimmer, Cederman &amp; Min (2009)</xref> have constructed a
        catalogue of politically relevant ethnic groups for most countries in the world and coded
        these groups against the conflicts in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict dataset.</p>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022343311431287">Cunningham, Gleditsch &amp; Salehyan
          (2009)</xref> introduce a new dataset, largely based on data from UCDP, focusing on
        variables specific to conflict organizations, such as troop size, organizational aspects,
        and technology. The Non-State Actor dataset is limited to organizations involved in
        conflict. It does not feature any control group, hence the dataset cannot be used to assess
        why some groups are involved in conflict and other are not. A complementary approach is
        offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022343311431287">Carey, Mitchell &amp; Lowe
          (2009)</xref>, who focus on conflict organizations that are associated with the
        government, so-called Pro-Government Armed Groups.</p>
      <p>A second set of contributions uses subnational administrative entities as the unit of
        observation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022343311431287">Østby, Nordås &amp;
          Rød, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022343311431287">Weidmann &amp; Ward,
          2010</xref>). Districts and provinces are easily identifiable, with clear geographic
        boundaries, and their political relevance is undisputed. This approach is quite similar to
        dividing the world into countries, just at a different scale. However, the composition and
        outline of political subunits are prone to change over time and their extent and function
        may vary substantially between countries. While these issues have been known for
        country-level studies, the magnitude of the problem is much larger for the subnational
        level. A geo-referenced, global time-series dataset on subnational units that will remedy
        some of these challenges is currently under development at ETH Zurich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343311431287">Deiwiks, 2010</xref>). While that project is very useful on
        its own merits, the underlying data structure is not ideal for managing non-political
        variables and conducting comparative cross-national research.</p>
      <p>The final category of disaggregated civil war studies substitutes countries with grid cells
        that allow for within-country variation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022343311431287">Buhaug &amp; Rød, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343311431287">Raleigh &amp; Hegre, 2009</xref>). This approach is
        sometimes referred to as quadrat sampling in spatial analysis, where data are collected
        using an overlay of a regular form, such as squares or hexagonal polygons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022343311431287">de Smith, Goodchild &amp; Longley,
          2007</xref>). Gridded data are inherently apolitical entities; they are fixed in time as
        well as space and are insensitive to political boundaries and developments. For this reason,
        the grid structure might be deemed worthless and irrelevant for conflict research. Yet, the
        stationary nature of the grid structure is a significant advantage, allowing for units of
        observation that are identical in shape and completely exogenous to the feature of interest
        (e.g. outbreak or incidence of civil war). Moreover, unlike other disaggregated approaches,
        gridded data may be scaled up or down by varying the resolution of the grid. Hence, we find
        the grid structure ideal to our objective: to generate a unified spatial data structure that
        can facilitate GIS-based research on civil war (as well as other phenomena of interest).</p>

      <title>Why standardization?</title>
      <p>The departure from the singular country-year data structure has been multifaceted. The
        plethora of methodological approaches to the local study of civil war opens up possibilities
        for empirical triangulation and solid generalizations. However, the many alternative
        solutions found are ineffective for the field as a whole. Data collected by one project are
        often incompatible with data from other projects. Time and money are wasted trying to
        reconcile basic but arbitrary differences. The standardization we propose is limited to the
        ways in which gridded data are collected, managed, and stored, but it is important
        nonetheless.</p>
      <p>GIS data come in a variety of different formats. A central distinction runs between raster
        data (analogous to bitmap or image pixels) and vector data. The latter type is further
        divided into point, line, and polygon data. Each data format has comparable advantages and
        disadvantages, and converting data between formats (e.g. from raster to vector) is
        complicated and may result in loss of information. An additional challenge concerns the unit
        resolution, which may range from exact geographic coordinates of point features (e.g. oil
        rigs) via rasterized data at various pixel resolutions (e.g. oil fields) to data available
        at federal state level (e.g. value of oil production). Various resampling techniques include
        aggregation of higher-resolution data by calculating mean values for each desired unit of
        observation, disaggregation of same values into smaller units, and recalculation of cell
        values by applying geospatial interpolation techniques (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022343311431287">Longley et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022343311431287">Figure 1</xref> illustrates how
        high-resolution land class raster data are converted into a smaller set of observations in
        the vector-based grid system. Only trained GIS experts are able to combine such data and
        convert the variables to a common set of observations. By streamlining spatial data in a
        unified grid structure, we believe PRIO-GRID constitutes a useful point of departure for
        scholars working with spatial data.</p>

      <title>PRIO-GRID: Structure and content</title>
      <p>PRIO-GRID is constructed by imposing a quadratic grid on the two-dimensional terrestrial
        plane using vector shapefiles, where each cell in the grid is represented by a square
        polygon vector feature. Each cell’s attributes are represented in the attached dBase (.dbf)
        attribute table, which includes the variables and values for each cell observation in the grid.<sup>
          <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022343311431287">2</xref>
        </sup> Spatially, the grid adheres to the dominant geographic coordinate system (the World
        Geodesic System, WGS84) where the arcs separating the grid cells are defined at exactly 0.5
        decimal degree intervals latitude and longitude, originating from the southwestern corner of
        the coordinate grid (90°S, 180°W). The complete global grid matrix consists of 360 rows x
        720 columns, amounting to 259,200 grid cells. A large majority of these cells carry little
        relevance in most applications as they cover oceans and other unpopulated areas, but 64,818
        cells contain at least a tiny sliver of land (Antarctica excluded), that is, cell land area
        ≥ 0.01 km<sup>2</sup> (slightly larger than a football pitch).</p>
      <p>The chosen resolution is not coincidental: 0.5 decimal degrees latitude/longitude
        correspond to roughly 50 x 50 km at the equator. Hence, even very small countries such as
        Burundi or Bhutan are represented by multiple grid cells that allow within-country variation
        on spatial data. At the same time, the grid is sufficiently coarse to avoid excessively
        large data files (though nearly 65,000 observations in a single global cross-section hardly
        can be considered small).<sup>
          <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022343311431287">3</xref>
        </sup> The selected grid size also corresponds well with available GIS data on, for example,
        population size and other demographic components, infant mortality, and various climate
        statistics. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022343311431287">Figure 2</xref> gives a

      <p>PRIO-GRID consists of two sets of files. The first set is the static grid, which contains
        information on the outline and coordinate system of the grid, including a unique identifier
        for each cell (<italic>gid</italic>), stored in the attribute table. The static PRIO-GRID
        additionally contains a limited selection of time-invariant information. Among these are
        size of the landmass in each cell, expressed in square kilometers; cell-specific population
        size estimates, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022343311431287">CIESIN’s
          (2005)</xref> Gridded Population of the World v. 3.0 dataset (four variables are provided,
        giving population estimates for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005, respectively); data on
        mountainous and closed forest terrain (expressed as percentage of cell area covered);
        estimates of the local level of economic activity, based on the G-Econ dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343311431287">Nordhaus, 2006</xref>); and information on
        ethnic group settlements, represented by group ID variables for spatially distinct ethnic
        groups that are present in each cell, derived from the GeoEPR Dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022343311431287">Wucherpfennig et al., 2011</xref>). See the codebook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022343311431287">Tollefsen, 2012</xref>) for further details
        on the data included in PRIO-GRID.</p>
      <p>The second set of files in PRIO-GRID contains time-varying indicators.<sup>
          <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022343311431287">4</xref>
        </sup> These files come in an annual format and are available for all years, 1946–2008. Each
        of the yearly grids presents a snapshot of the world for the corresponding year. A key
        component of the grid year files is the inclusion of country information, which allows
        combining measures of local conditions and events with country-level information (e.g.
        democracy score). Since the PRIO-GRID structure in effect is a two-dimensional spatial
        matrix, it contains no overlapping cells. Each grid cell can only belong to one country
        during a calendar year. This implies that some level of data manipulation was necessary in
        cases where a cell overlaps the boundary between countries and where a cell’s territory
        shifts from one country to another during a year. The former challenge was resolved by
        assigning cells to the country that covers the largest share of the cell area (plurality
        rule). In case of temporal overlap, a cell was assigned to the country that had legal
        ownership of the underlying territory on 1 January in the year of observation.</p>
      <p>Spatial information on the outline of independent states was derived from the CShapes
        dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022343311431287">Weidmann, Kuse &amp; Gleditsch,
          2010</xref>). CShapes includes data on start and end date and shape of all country
        boundary changes since 1 January 1946 and is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343311431287">Gleditsch &amp; Ward’s (1999)</xref> system membership list.
        This information was converted to the vector grid structure by allocating Gleditsch-Ward
        numeric country codes (<italic>gwcode</italic>) to all cells in correspondence with the
        plurality rule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022343311431287">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

      <p>The annual PRIO-GRID files contain a number of time-varying covariates. Among these, we
        find cell-specific information on the onset and incidence of armed conflicts, represented by
        a conflict ID variable that corresponds to the case identifier in the UCDP/PRIO Armed
        Conflict Dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343311431287">Gleditsch et al.,
          2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022343311431287">Harbom &amp; Wallensteen,
          2010</xref>). In case of multiple conflicts within a cell, all conflict IDs are listed in
        the attribute table. Data on spatial extent of the conflict zones were derived from the
        affiliated PRIO Conflict Site dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022343311431287">Hallberg, 2012</xref>).<sup>
          <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022343311431287">5</xref>
        </sup> Other data of potential interest to users include various climatic indicators that
        give cell-specific information on annual temperature and precipitation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022343311431287">Theisen, Holtermann &amp; Buhaug,
          2011/12</xref>).</p>
      <p>In addition to providing a default set of geo-referenced variables, the PRIO-GRID framework
        opens for easy expansion to include other GIS data. For example, the Demographic and Health
        Surveys (DHS) program now routinely registers GPS coordinates for the location of surveyed
        households. This opens up for generating a host of localized socio-economic indicators,
        including measures of economic vulnerability and intergroup inequalities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022343311431287">Østby, Nordås &amp; Rød, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The PRIO-GRID codebook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022343311431287">Tollefsen,
          2012</xref>) includes user-friendly instructions on how to adapt and import additional
        data into the PRIO-GRID structure. Future releases of PRIO-GRID are likely to include a
        larger range of optional data. Moreover, there are concrete plans to release PRIO-GRID with
        other resolutions and let the user decide which grid size is more appropriate to her
        particular research objective. Alternative resolutions also facilitate sensitivity analysis
        and explicit consideration of possible biases relating to the modifiable areal unit problem
        (MAUP) and increasing spatial dependence with more refined data (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022343311431287">Openshaw, 1984</xref>).</p>
      <p>A final benefit of PRIO-GRID is the opportunity to generate country aggregates, weighted by
        cell area or cell population, for example. While some data are unavailable in a
        geo-referenced format, the reverse is also true; some data come only as raster or gridded
        data. For example, there are good daily, monthly, and annual climate statistics at the
        global level, and measurements of temperature and precipitation are also available as
        geo-referenced data. However, these data are not released in a country-year format. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022343311431287">Figure 4</xref> illustrates how PRIO-GRID may
        be used to calculate country aggregate area-weighted estimates of total annual precipitation
        by spatially summarizing a precipitation layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022343311431287">GPCC, 2010</xref>) into a CShapes layer containing the
        contemporaneous outline of states. Note that large countries, such as Nigeria, have
        substantial within-country variation in climate, implying that the country average rainfall
        estimate often is a poor proxy for local climatic conditions.</p>

      <title>A note on spatial autocorrelation</title>
      <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022343311431287">Tobler (1970</xref>: 236)
        ‘Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant
        things.’ The assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations
        made in inferential statistics often does not hold when working with geographic data.
        Positive spatial autocorrelation implies that similar values are clustered in space whereas
        negative autocorrelation denotes a larger heterogeneity in values (checkerboard pattern)
        than expected by chance. There are various ways to assess the extent of autocorrelation in
        the data.</p>
      <p>A global spatial autocorrelation statistic (e.g. Moran’s I) provides information on the
        degree of similarity among the observations in the whole study area and is analogous to
        Pearson’s r. A complementary measure, the local Moran’s I, further reveals where clustering
        of (dis-) similar attributes are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022343311431287">Longley et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>A spatially gridded dataset such as PRIO-GRID inevitably contains indicators with similar
        values among proximate grid cells. For example, a global Moran’s I test shows that the
        world’s population is concentrated in a small part of all inhabited land area
          (<italic>I</italic> = 0.61). To reveal where high or low values cluster locally we may
        apply a test for local spatial autocorrelation using the local Moran’s I. This would reveal
        whether the similarity in neighboring values is greater than what we should expect by
        chance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022343311431287">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the
        settlement pattern in India. Unsurprisingly, we find a high degree of spatial clustering in
        parts of the study area – both highly densely populated areas and areas with scattered
        populations. The next section illustrates briefly how autocorrelation may bias regression
        coefficients and how this bias may be corrected.</p>

      <title>Demonstration of use</title>
      <p>As a demonstration of PRIO-GRID, we investigate the spatial relationship between population
        density and economic activity in India. It is well established that economic development
        spurs urbanization; in fact, no country has ever experienced sustained economic growth
        without simultaneous growth in the urban population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022343311431287">UN, 2010</xref>). But a reverse effect is also at play:
        urban areas provide benefits for industries (economies of scale) through agglomeration and
        complementary services, a large pool of labor, and proximity to markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022343311431287">Quigley, 1998</xref>). Regardless of which
        direction of causality is more important, we should expect population density and economic
        activity to be highly correlated in space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022343311431287">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>A visual inspection of economic and demographic data for India verifies that areas with
        high population density overlap with areas with high economic activity. If we want to
        estimate the effect of population density on local income, then, failing to control for
        spatial autocorrelation will return biased estimates. To illustrate, we run three simple
        regression models using the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022343311431287">Figure 6</xref>: a naïve OLS model (1), a spatial error model (2), and a spatial lag
        model (3). All three models use the same dependent variable, PPP-adjusted Gross Cell Product
        (billion 1990 USD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343311431287">Nordhaus,
          2006</xref>), which is regressed against cell population size (million), population
        squared, and cell area (1,000 km<sup>2</sup>). The sample consists of all grid cells in
        India for a single cross section (1990).</p>
      <p>The rationales behind the spatial lag and error models are somewhat different. The spatial
        lag model assumes that there is a diffusion process where the economic activity of a given
        cell is dependent on the activity in adjacent cells. The spatial error model is based on an
        assumption of spatially correlated omitted variables. By decomposing the error term into a
        spatial part and a unique part, the unique component should be i.i.d. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022343311431287">Ward &amp; Gleditsch, 2008</xref>: 39). Although we would
        have a preference for the spatial lag model in this context, the purpose of this exercise is
        not to identify key correlates of local economic activity (for which the model clearly is
        underspecified) but rather to demonstrate how failing to account for correlation structures
        in the data may bias regression estimates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343311431287">Table II</xref>).</p>

      <p>All three models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343311431287">Table II</xref>
        return a positive parameter estimate for population size. The magnitude of this effect
        varies between the models, however. The naïve Model 1, which completely ignores the spatial
        clustering in the data, suggests that the isolated effect of local population size on
        economic activity is quite strong, with an estimated addition of almost $3,000 per extra
        person in each cell (slightly less than the 2009 Indian average GDP/capita estimate and much
        more than the 1990 GDP/capita estimate). The spatial error model (2) returns a much more
        modest effect of almost $1,750 per extra person, which is closer to the 1990 PPP-adjusted
        average of $1,250. The coefficient for the spatial lag model (3), indicating an increase of
        $1,370 per extra head, is quite close to the 1990 estimate of GDP/capita for India. However,
        interpreting the estimate in this manner would imply assuming a constant population effect
        across space, which we know is not true. The spatial lag not only corrects for spatial
        interdependence, it also carries an effect onto the interpretation of the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022343311431287">Ward &amp; Gleditsch 2008</xref>: 44ff).
        When we take the spatial lag into account, we find that the relationship between economic
        activity and population is estimated to be more or less flat for large parts of the sample.
        Of the 1,197 cells in the sample, 593 have an estimated effect of less than $10 per extra
        person, while 750 observations have an estimated effect below $100. Only 106 cells have an
        estimated effect above the 1990 estimate of GDP/capita of $1,250. For five cells, the
        estimated effect for each additional citizen is an increase in GCP by more than $10,000.
        These are the cities of Kolkata (two cells), Delhi, Mumbai, and Madras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0022343311431287">Figure 7</xref>).<sup>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The quantitative civil war scholarship is gradually recognizing the widespread disconnect
        between individual- and group-based theories of mobilization and political violence on the
        one side and country-level empirical analyses of armed conflict on the other. Most civil
        wars are highly local events and many have little impact on the society at large. Likewise,
        national data are often poor proxies for the conditions where conflicts occur, and their use
        may lead to ecological fallacy: inferring about individual behavior from aggregate data. As
        ever more geo-referenced data and user-friendly GIS applications develop, spatial
        disaggregation becomes more viable and attractive.</p>
      <p>Spatial disaggregation is not without limitations, however. One challenge is the temporal
        dimension, which is restricted for many types of spatial data (notably for indicators
        derived from remote sensing); another is the demand for computational power when working
        with large datasets. Our recommendation is to let the research question and the theoretical
        approach determine whether gridded data or other subnational research designs are more
        appropriate than conventional country-level analysis. Accordingly, we offer PRIO-GRID as a
        supplement to conventional data structures in an effort to facilitate more detailed and
        spatially sensitive analyses of social phenomena and conditions that cannot be studied at
        the country level without loss of information.</p>
