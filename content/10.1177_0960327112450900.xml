<abstract>
<p>The toxicity of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or phytoestrogen is relatively well characterized. However, the toxicity of combined exposure to PAHs and phytoestrogen is not well investigated. In the present study, benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and benzo(k)fluorathene (B(k)F), genistein, along with 17β-estradiol (E2), were investigated for their single and combined developmental toxicity using zebrafish embryos as model system. We demonstrated that two representative PAHs, both B(a)P (≥1 μM) and B(k)F (≥10 μM), can cause significant malformation and mortality in developing zebrafish embryos. The toxicity effect of B(a)P was in general higher than that of B(k)F. Developmental exposure to high level of genistein (&gt;20 μM) or E2 (&gt;10 μM), also caused significant malformation and mortality in zebrafish larvae at 120 hours post fertilization (hpf). However, different toxic effects were observed for the combined exposure to PAHs and phytoestrogen in zebrafish. Lower doses of genistein (1 and 10 μM) and E2 (0.1 and 1 μM), when used in combination with high concentration of B(a)P (1 μM) or B(k)F (20 μM), can significantly suppress the toxicity effect of B(a)P and B(k)F in developing zebrafish embryos. The beneficial effect of genistein may be due to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes via directly interacting with aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, or disturbing the AhR pathway through interacting with estrogen receptor pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are widely distributed in the environment and derive from many different human activities (pesticides and industrial products) and are often found in many natural products (phytoestrogens). Currently, there are considerable health concerns over the environmental occurrence of EDCs, since these molecules have the potential to disrupt the body homeostasis of endogenous hormones and consequently affect development, reproduction and behavior in many organisms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327112450900">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), one major class of EDCs, are ubiquitous environmental contaminants as a result of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and other organic matter.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0960327112450900">2</xref>
</sup> PAHs are resistant to environmental degradation due to their highly hydrophobic nature, causing detrimental biological effects, toxicity, mutagenecity and carcinogenicity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0960327112450900">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327112450900">4</xref>
</sup> Benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and benzo(k)fluorathene (B(k)F) are two typical representatives of the PAHs. The PAHs are bioactivated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1/CYP1B1 enzymes to reactive intermediates that bind to DNA, a critical step in the initiation of carcinogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327112450900">5</xref>
</sup> Aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays a critical role in the induction of CYP1 enzymes (i.e. CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1) by PAHs, many of which are AhR ligands.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327112450900">6</xref>
</sup> In addition to AhR-dependent toxicological pathway, several studies also suggested that PAHs or their metabolites may interact with estrogen receptors (ERs) and exhibited either weak estrogenic or antiestrogenic responses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0960327112450900">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Phytoestrogens, including isoflavones, coumestans and lignans, are nonsteroidal and plant-derived compounds and have been found in many fruits, vegetables and whole grains commonly consumed by humans. Soybeans, clover, alfalfa sprouts and oilseeds are the most significant dietary sources of isoflavones, coumestans and lignans.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0960327112450900">8</xref>
</sup> Phytoestrogens are structurally very similar to the estrogen 17β-estradiol and can exhibit selective ER modulating activities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327112450900">9</xref>
</sup> Some phytoestrogens also alter CYPs through binding to AhR, acting as either AhR agonists or antagonists.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0960327112450900">10</xref>
</sup> Genistein (4′,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone) belongs to the family of isoflavones found in high levels in soybean, its prophylactic use has been studied with regards to cancer, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and for the treatment of menopausal symptoms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0960327112450900">11</xref>
</sup> However, the beneficial effects of long-term exposure to phytoestrogen genistein are controversial and both tumorigenic and antitumorigenic effects have been reported, especially in hormone-dependent breast and prostate cancer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0960327112450900">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0960327112450900">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Humans are exposed to two major classes of EDCs, PAHs (environmental pollutants) and phytoestrogens (dietary component), throughout their daily lives. Both the classes of chemicals have estrogenic or antiestrogenic activity via binding either to ER or AhR. The two classes of EDCs are ubiquitous and coexist under many situations in real human life. When coexposure occurs, phytoestrogens and PAHs can exert their unique toxicity independently, but they may also interfere with each other’s activity in some aspects of biological event. For example, the soya isoflavone genistein has been shown previously to be an inhibitor of PAH metabolite binding to DNA, and the oxidative DNA damage induced by PAHs in noncancerous breast cells MCF-10A could be removed by cotreating with 10 μ<sc>m</sc> genistein.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0960327112450900">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The toxicity of exposure to phytoestrogens or PAHs has been studied intensively on various cell lines and animal models. However, most of these experiments examined the toxic effects following single chemical exposure. The combined toxic effects of exposure to phytoestrogens and PAHs have not been fully investigated yet using an in vivo animal model, while there are only a few in vitro studies. Recently, zebrafish embryos have become one of the most popular and well-established models for assessing the toxicity of chemicals and drugs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0960327112450900">15</xref>
</sup> This model is exceptional because of its high reproductive capacity and the transparency of embryos as well as its rapid development that allows morphological observations of the organogenesis following chemical treatment. In this study, we chose B(a)P and B(k)F as two representatives of the PAHs and genistein as a representative of phytoestrogen. The aim is to explore the complex biological or toxic effect following coexposure to phytoestrogens and PAHs using zebrafish as a model system.</p>

<title>Exposure of zebrafish embryos</title>
<p>Chemical exposure was initiated at 50% epiboly stage (6 hours post fertilization (hpf)). Briefly, chemical stock solutions were diluted in fresh fish water to create a series of working solutions with the concentration gradient as followings: genistein: 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 20 and 50 μM; E2: 0.1, 1 and 10 μM; B(a)P: 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 10 μM; and B(k)F: 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 50 μM. Experiments were conducted in six-well plates with 10 embryos per well in 3 mL working solution. The control group was treated with fish water containing 0.1% DMSO. The exposure started at 6 hpf and ended at 120 hpf. No fish water was changed during the 5-day exposure. Plates were covered with lids to avoid evaporation. For coexposure experiment, embryos were treated with PAHs (B(a)P or B(k)F) and phytoestrogen (genistein or E2) at the same time, which had the following concentrations: genistein (1 or 10 μM), E2 (0.1 or 1 μM), B(a)P (0.1 or 1 μM) and B(k)F (10 or 20 μM). To further confirm the protective effect of genistein and E2 against the PAHs, zebrafish embryos were pretreated with genistein (1 or 10 μM) or E2 (1, 2, 5 μM) for 24 hours beginning 6 hpf. At 30 hpf, fish water containing genistein or E2 was removed and embryos were exposed to 1 μM B(a)P only until 96 hpf. In this study, the concentrations of the chemicals were chosen based on the published literatures<sup>

</sup> and our preliminary dose-range finding study, since there is very limited information on zebrafish model with these chemicals.</p>
<p>For all experiments, embryos were examined daily for developmental defect. Hatch, mortality and malformation of embryos were recorded and dead embryos were removed to avoid possible adverse effects to other living embryos. The percentage mortality was calculated as the number of dead embryos during the course of experiment divided by the total number of embryos. Cessation of heartbeat and blood circulation was used as an indicator for death. The percent malformation was calculated as the number of embryos having any deformities (including dead animals resulted from malformation) divided by the total number of embryos. For each experimental run, all treatments were performed in triplicate. All experiments were replicated three times, thus yielding 90 embryos per treatment group in total.</p>

<title>Developmental toxicity of exposure to B(a)P or B(k)F on zebrafish embryos</title>
<p>In this study, exposure to B(a)P and B(k)F significantly increased the rate of malformation and mortality at the concentration of 1 and 10 μM, respectively, at 120 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0960327112450900">Figure 1</xref>(a) and (b)). When exposed to 1 μM B(a)P, the rates of malformation and mortality of embryos were nearly 100% at 120 hpf and the hatch rate was below 80%. When the exposure level increased to 10 μM, B(a)P treatment killed all the embryos prior to 48 hpf before hatching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0960327112450900">Figure 1</xref>(a)). Compared with B(a)P, the teratogenic and lethal effects of B(k)F were relatively low. When exposed to 10 μM of B(k)F, the malformation and mortality of embryos were 69% and 53%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0960327112450900">Figure 1</xref>(b)). When exposed to 50 μM B(k)F, the malformation and mortality of embryos were increased to 85% and 69%, with the hatch rate below 77% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0960327112450900">Figure 1</xref>(b)). As we observed, developmental exposure to higher concentration of B(a)P (1 μM) and B(k)F (10 or 50 μM) induced similar types of malformations on zebrafish larvae at 120 hpf, for example, pericardial edema, somite deformity, yolk sac edema and weak pigmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0960327112450900">Figure 1</xref>(c) to (f)). However, no significant differences were observed on the type and incidence of malformations between two chemical treatments. In general, hatched embryos had very slow heart beat and difficulty in movement, and usually they will not survive longer than a few days beyond 120 hpf.</p>

<p>To further confirm the protective effect of genistein and E2 against the PAHs, zebrafish embryos were pretreated with genistein (1 or 10 μM) or E2 (1, 2 and 5 μM) for 24 hours beginning 6 hpf. At 30 hpf, medium containing genistein or E2 was removed and embryos were exposed to 1 μM B(a)P only until 96 hpf. In relation to the pretreatment with genistein or E2, our result demonstrated that the malformation rate and mortality of embryos at 96 hpf were both 78% when treated with 1 μM B(a)P only. However, the malformation rate was dropped to 12% and mortality dropped to 5%–8%, when embryos were pretreated with genistein at 1 and 10 μM (data not shown). Pretreatment with E2 at 1, 2 and 5 μM similarly blocked the toxic effects of subsequent 1 μM B(a)P exposure. The malformation and mortality of pretreated fish were both significantly lower than that of 1 μM B(a)P treatment group at 96 hpf (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that two representative PAHs, B(a)P (≥1 μM) and B(k)F (≥10 μM), can cause significant malformation and mortality in developing zebrafish embryos. The toxicity effect of B(a)P was in general much pronounced than that of B(k)F. The observed phenotypes of malformation in fish embryos exposed to B(a)P or B(k)F included somite deformities, pericardial edema, yolk sac edema and weak pigmentation, which were consistent with previous reports.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0960327112450900">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327112450900">21</xref>
</sup> Developmental exposure to high level of genistein (≥20 μM) or E2 (≥10 μM) also caused significant malformation and mortality in zebrafish larvae at 120 hpf. Our study also demonstrated for the first time the different toxic effects for combined exposure to PAHs and phytoestrogen in zebrafish model. Interestingly, lower doses of genistein (1 and 10 μM) and E2 (0.1 and 1 μM), when used in combination with high concentration of B(a)P (1 μM) or B(k)F (20 μM), can significantly suppress the toxicity effect of B(a)P and B(k)F in developing zebrafish embryos.</p>
<p>PAHs and phytoestrogens are two major classes of EDCs in the environment. Numerous studies have discovered that EDCs (i.e. phytoestrogen from diet and PAHs from synthesized compound), like endogenous estrogen E2, are capable of binding with ER and exert the estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327112450900">9</xref>
</sup> The ERs, ERα and ERβ, play a central role in mediating the biological effects of estrogen, which is a key regulatory hormone that affects numerous physiological processes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0960327112450900">22</xref>
</sup> The expression of ERα and ERβ vary dramatically among different organs or cell types. The two receptors regulate different sets of biological functions and induce dissimilar responses within the same cell type or tissue. Previous reports have shown that phytoestrogens (genistein and coumestrol) are ERβ stimulants and preferentially binds human ERβ over ERα; compared with ERα, ERβ exhibits a 7- to 70-fold greater binding affinity for genistein, whereas E2 binds ERα and ERβ with equal affinity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0960327112450900">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0960327112450900">23</xref>
</sup> In this study, zebrafish embryos were developmentally coexposed to the PAHs with genistein or E2 during early developmental stage. Our results demonstrated that genistein as strong ERβ stimulant is capable of suppressing the toxicity of B(a)P with even higher efficiency than E2, suggesting that ERβ, rather than ERα, may play a central role in mediating the beneficial effects of phytoestrogen genistein against toxicity of PAH, if phytoestrogen exert protective effects via ER-mediated pathway.</p>
<p>How does phytoestrogen suppress the toxicity of PAHs in zebrafish embryos? Based on the published studies, we speculate that the underlying mechanisms may involve ER-mediated pathways or AhR-mediated pathways. First, it has been shown that activation of ERα may affect the AhR gene expression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0960327112450900">24</xref>
</sup> As genistein can still bind to ERα with low affinity,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0960327112450900">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0960327112450900">23</xref>
</sup> genistein may counteract the toxicity of PAHs by regulating the expression level of AhR via ERα-mediated pathway. Second, <italic>CYP</italic> genes are sensitive to estrogen treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0960327112450900">25</xref>
</sup> It has been shown that some phytoestrogens can modulate the CYP system including activation or inhibition of these enzymes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0960327112450900">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0960327112450900">27</xref>
</sup> For instance, previous studies demonstrated that genistein inhibits CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and CYP3A4 activity in vitro<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0960327112450900">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0960327112450900">29</xref>
</sup> and inhibits CTP1A2 and CTP2E1 activity in vivo.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0960327112450900">30</xref>
</sup> This inhibited CYPs activity may interfere with the formation of reactive intermediates of PAHs and therefore slow down the initiation of carcinogenesis or other cytotoxcity. Third, some phytoestrogens alter CYPs via binding to AhR directly, acting as either AhR agonists or antagonist.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0960327112450900">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In summary, the present study utilized zebrafish embryos as a new model to evaluate the developmental toxicity of single or combined exposure to PAHs and phytoestrogens. Our results demonstrate that genistein and E2, when used at lower dose, can suppress the toxic effect of B(a)P and B(k)F on zebrafish embryos. The beneficial effect of genistein may be due to the inhibition of CYP enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1) via directly interacting with AhR pathway, or disturbing the AhR pathway through interacting with ER pathway. However, further studies on elucidating the molecular mechanism and the cross talk between ER and AhR pathway will be needed.</p>
