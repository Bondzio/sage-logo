<p>The architectural and urban histories under review here address several normative discourses. Mostly these are Eurocentric, but one, a paradigm of rise and decline, originated in the Ottoman empire itself and was later haply taken over by European scholars. The apex of this parabolic historiography was found in the Süleymanic sixteenth century, a “golden age,” which, like other idealistic products of early modern intellectual culture, had a protoessentialist timelessness about it and an inevitably teleological pull on adjacent centuries. The fifteenth and eighteenth centuries, addressed respectively in the works by Çiğdem Kafescioğlu and Shirine Hamadeh, took on aspects of an inexorable approach and a fall from grace that slumped aside the cultural summit.</p>
<p>By straddling this better-known normative moment, the works of Kafescioğlu and Hamadeh allow for new <italic>longue-durée</italic> views of urban patterns beyond the teleological one. Ironically enough, the most evident pattern to emerge is one of continual refurbishment and change. Seen from this perspective, Ottoman urbanism’s principal characteristics are not just its flexibility, fluidity, and internal vigor but the relative autonomy of each period under consideration, as if each thoroughly “rethought” its bases for urban intervention. These works further make it clear that in each period, the changing tides of Istanbul architectural urbanism reflected an ongoing (re)conceptualization of the nature of legitimate Ottoman power as well as the changing constitution of the <italic>reaya</italic>, or nonmilitary, taxpaying subject populations.</p>
<p>Sultanic initiatives, the single most transformative force in city development, were complex, not simply “top-down,” proceedings. Although the nature of the physical involvement with the urban fabric is vastly different in the two centuries under consideration, in both cases, royal commissions demonstrate a responsiveness to the urban dynamics they were engaging (from processes of class reconfiguration to preexisting <italic>lieux de mémoire</italic>). The hybrid aspects of their architectural aesthetics—quite different from those of the “classic” sixteenth century—reflect a politic and poetic malleability of Ottoman self-representation. In both cases too—and again in contrast to the intervening sixteenth century—a wider social range seems to have participated in urban patronage, though the “lesser elites” are of quite different constitution in the two periods. Kafescioğlu terms this a cooperative relationship, while Hamadeh speaks of the impossibility of distinguishing the mutual roles of ruling elite and lesser patrons in the creation of this joint urban culture. In either case, Ottoman urban culture is rendered in both these works as a dialogical, not simply impositional, project, and a systemic (but not fully systematic) process. Both authors recognize urban agency on a fine- as well as a large-grained level.</p>
<p>Another paradigm of timeless stasis, Orientalism’s “Islamic city” discourse, exacerbated Weberian dichotomies (e.g., tradition/modernity) and cast its subject into the netherworld of perpetual “premodernity.” As “traditional,” “the Islamic city” was unplanned and fundamentally chaotic; its schematically simple urban patterns were held to reflect the unconsciously operative values of patriarchal “Islamic” civilization. It was considered bereft of the civic spirit and initiative that gave rise to the late medieval European municipal awakening and forever innocent of the “invention of conscious urban planning,” as Westfall once defined the mid-fifteenth-century Roman projects of Pope Nicholas V and Leon Battista Alberti.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211420650">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kafescioğlu makes short work of this model. Contemporary historians made clear the extent to which Sultan Mehmed II—the Conqueror—planned and oversaw the repopulation and rebuilding of the city from its dilapidated state at conquest. His first efforts were large scale, but provisional, but in 1459, an enormous program of Sultanic building was announced with the New Palace and Conqueror’s mosque complex at the program’s heart. At the same time, Mehmed II delegated his principal grandees to follow suit, to choose a locale and embellish it with religious, commercial, and cultural infrastructure. Until recently, most accounts have construed this vast program as one of ideological Islamization, or alternatively, as a kind of Turkification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211420650">2</xref></sup> In Kafescioğlu’s subtle and convincing reading, these were at best but parts of a more complex and overarching “imperial” vision, one that was as much enacted as expressed by his urban program, and whose programmatic intent emerges all the more clearly for the resistance it provoked in certain quarters.</p>
<p>Mehmed II transformed an informally organized, frontier warrior (<italic>gazi</italic>) state led by a <italic>primus inter pares</italic> sultan into a more centralized and hierarchical polity. Declaring Konstantiniyye his imperial capital, Mehmed signaled this change and began to establish that “pact between a territorial state and the capital city” (p. 130), which Braudel saw as a general fifteenth-century trend. Sidelining the <italic>gazi</italic>/dervish milieu, Mehmed cultivated his <italic>kapıkul</italic> (slave-servants of the sultan), from which he derived the military and administrative elites of the imperial service. Among this group were Greek and Balkan converts to Islam of aristocratic background, some of whom reached the highest echelons of power and were called upon to effect the rebuilding of the city. Granted land and significant leeway in choice of site as well as function and style of components, their often enormous projects included, variously, mosques, baths, commercial structures, medreses, and public fountains.</p>
<p>While the interpretive schema of Islamization and Turkification suggest wholesale rupture with Constantinople’s past, Kafescioğlu shows that continuities are at least as important. To frame his transformation of the Ottoman polity and project Constantinople as imperial capital, Mehmed “selectively appropriated” aspects of Byzantine culture and Constantinople’s own resoundingly imperial past, couching a set of imperial messages to different audiences both inside and outside the capital and the empire. The conversion of Hagia Sophia to Ayasofya is a case in point. Although Ottoman announcements to other Muslim rulers played the traditional tropes of conquest, bragging of churches converted to mosques and bell towers to minarets, in fact, according to Kafescioğlu, Ayasofya alone suffered this fate. The actual physical conversion left most mosaics visible and a bell tower standing next to the new minaret, thus preserving “to a remarkable degree [Ayasofya’s] Byzantine Christian identity” (p. 21).</p>
<p>Some of the outlines of Kafescioğlu’s interpretation have been suggested in earlier works by Necipoğlu, Yerasimos, and Kafescioğlu herself, most of which were dedicated to the major Sultanic projects: Mehmed II’s New Mosque complex at the site of the Holy Apostles, the New Palace (the “Topkapı Palace,” which replaced the six-year-old Old Palace), and the just cited conversion of Hagia Sophia. Even for such relatively well-considered matters, Kafescioğlu’s presentation is continually insightful and now provides the best short introduction available.</p>
<p>The New Palace, atop the ancient Akropolis, flanked Ayasofya as the Byzantine palace flanked it once to the opposite side. The New Complex, of Friday mosque, eight (!) medreses, mausoleum, hospice, hospital, and a host of other charitable and commercial institutions, was set on the city’s highest hill, the site of the Church of the Holy Apostles, burial place of the city founder, Constantine. The orthogonal layout of the mosque and medrese complex seems a product of Early Renaissance classicism, a radical departure from the loose, topographically sensitive complexes of the past. While scholars have long noted its similarity to plans by Filarete, who embarked for Istanbul, the attribution is very problematic, not least because there is no evidence he ever arrived. Kafescioğlu is inclined to see behind it the mind of the humanist Filelfo, once attached to the Paleologan court, rather than the design of his protégé Filarete. More important is the indication that “shared cultural and political dispositions . . . rendered meaningful the cultural products that ostensibly belonged to the world of the other” (p. 75). At this point, Ottoman architectural “identity” is assertively hybrid (not teleologically “precanonical”). This also is evident in the various conceptions of the vizierial mosques, as in the New Palace’s pavilions and porticoes in a host of well-identified styles (Greek, Persian, Turkish, Italian, Mamluk), which Necipoğlu showed articulate the newly universalizing pretensions of the Ottoman monarchy.</p>
<p>While aptly specifying the variety of vizierial contributions, Kafescioğlu’s larger point is that what tied these “developers” together is that they were former Greek aristocrats, who served themselves and the sultan by establishing wide ranging support and patronage networks in the city through their vast endowments. The mosques of these officials were often grand; more surprising is that some of their baths were grander yet. With their dominating domical architecture and large <italic>camekan</italic> (apodyterium) spaces, these baths met the needs of far more than “ritual requirements.” Instead, they provided “nonconfessional urban foci . . . linked to the locus of rule, [which extended] the patronage and charity of the founders to all religious groups.” Kafescioğlu shows too that the city’s similarly magnificent bedestens, luxury markets at the city’s commercial core, encouraged such social melding, and at times even served as a forum for dissent.</p>
<p>This project of urban “resignification”—Kafescioğlu makes apt use of Tafuri’s term for the contemporary project of Pope Nicholas V—is further illuminated by a fascinating tour through a series of graphic images done of the city, both in European and Ottoman contexts. Most intriguing is her case that the lost “original” behind Vavassore’s famous 1530s “Byzantium sive Costantineopolis” was commissioned by Mehmed II, a possibility hitherto overlooked because its expressions of Ottoman power seemed so muted. Kafescioğlu shows that royal interventions are indeed given emphasis, even as the presence of Byzantine imperial monuments and Christian churches pronounced strong lived continuities. A harbor thronged with ships flying the Lion of St. Mark, the Byzantine eagle, and the Ottoman crescent alike, “advertise” resurgent commercial possibilities in the metropolis/emporium. While decidedly an imperial image, it nevertheless refrained from making “pure assertions” but “took shape through dialogues between the contrasting visions of its contenders (p. 176).</p>
<p>Kafescioğlu’s fourth chapter, “Istanbul Inhabited,” is wide ranging, offering demographic analyses, comments on the effects and intentions of forced population transfers, and a surprisingly evocative portrayal of the built fabric, little of which, needless to say, survives. Her main sources are a set of census and endowment surveys done in the late fifteenth century. They serve to illuminate physical and social structures in Konstantiniyye but also help reconstruct the “organizing principles” behind the documents themselves, as well as the “rupture” between such constructs and actual urban practices.</p>
<p>Organized by neighborhood, the documents initially seem to fit “Islamic city” constructs, whereby the city was effectively the additive sum of mosque-centered neighborhoods, each of which was more or less an “organic” unit of fixed physical and social constitution. The realities on the ground were considerably more fluid. Even transferred populations did not always settle in ethnically united neighborhoods but often split up in several contingents. Many neighborhoods exhibited pronounced internal diversity. No more than half centered on a mosque; many instead were named after local Byzantine landmarks, baths, ports, city gates, markets, and so on. Names of neighborhoods, their borders, and their constitutions changed rapidly throughout the period and into the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>This is a thoroughly researched and deeply considered book. Kafescioğlu avoids reductive portrayals, and her nuanced account reflects the multivalent urban significance of Mehmed’s new capital. The illustrations are on the whole excellent, but some of the maps obscure. Some of those taken from the water distribution survey might have profited from more labeling, and if color were used on the encyclopedic map of the neighborhoods (Map 3), some patterns might have been visible in a glance. On the other hand, the map of Edirne (Figure 103) has too much information and does not illustrate what the text references, the location of the suburban palaces (p. 131). But these are obviously side issues. Besides its monographic excellence, this work should allow a widened understanding of fifteenth-century capitals, somewhat less tightly tethered to the European experience, but whose expanded scope yet remains in many respects characteristically (early) “early modern.”</p>
<p>Yet another set of paradigms apply specifically to the late Ottoman world. Shirine Hamadeh’s <italic>The City’s Pleasures</italic>, on the architecture and urbanism of eighteenth-century Istanbul, challenges assumptions behind the notions of the “Tulip Period,” an eighteenth-century version of the “decline thesis,” and what she elsewhere calls (with appropriate resignation) “the inevitable question of Westernization.” The “Tulip Period,” spearheaded by Sultan Ahmed III’s Grand Vizier Damad İbrahim Pasha (1718-1730), is generally depicted as the Ottoman’s “last holiday.” This pleasure-seeking epoch’s principal cultural virtue is usually accounted its westward looking ethos, understood as reflective of waning cultural “self-confidence,” which in turn was expressed architecturally in the Ottoman use of European Baroque, Rococo and Neo-Classical motifs. The “Tulip Period’s” demise typically has been ascribed to the 1730 Patrona Halil revolt, which saw the restoration of conservative factions to power. Hamadeh upsets a number of these apple carts in her account.</p>
<p><italic>The City’s Pleasures</italic> (re)collects, rephrases, and considerably expands arguments presented by Hamadeh in a set of earlier publications that already have transformed our understanding of Ottoman eighteenth-century architectural and urban culture. This study, arranged thematically rather than chronologically, begins with Sultan Ahmed III’s 1703 return of the Sultanate to Istanbul after a half-century hiatus in Edirne and goes on to cover his reign (1703-1730) and that of Mahmud I (1730-1754) while extending a more general purview to the last years of the century. Hamadeh’s architectural foci are royal and subroyal gardens and garden palaces that proliferated along the Bosporus and elsewhere and the monumental freestanding <italic>meydan</italic> fountains that sprung up in great numbers in both urban and suburban settings. Just as crucial to her account are the increasingly vibrant public spaces associated with these <italic>meydans</italic> and public gardens. She establishes that neither the ethos nor the formal features of the Tulip Period can be said to have been brought to a close by the 1730 revolt, that the “pleasurable” aspects of cultural expression were underscored by a coherent aesthetics and moreover served legitimizing purposes, and finally that such values were never purveyed exclusively by the ruling elite but were cultivated in an unprecedented way by a mixed milieu of social classes. Her nuanced analysis shows that this was not simply a trickle-down dynamic with middle-class patrons picking up crumbs at the ruling-class table but a truly multivalent cultural occurrence, in which “bottom-up” trajectories were at least as evident as the reverse. And finally, she shows that cultural development in the period was largely an internal affair, with intra-Ottoman dialogue of much greater weight than Westernization models suggest. Instead, evident Westernisms are embedded in an architectural culture that sought out “hybrid” elements in Safavid, Mughal, early Ottoman, and other sources.</p>
<p>Hamadeh’s astute reading of radically novel architectural trends is complemented by her illuminating accounts of changing social mores, cultural values, and the spaces of public leisure. These are in turn facilitated by her penetrating analyses of Ottoman eighteenth-century poetic texts. Much more than a superficial overview, hers is a true interdisciplinary approach that documents deep-lying cultural trends.</p>
<p>She makes particularly fruitful use of a veritable treasure trove of hitherto unexamined poetic texts on architecture, in collected volumes of “histories in verse.” Also called “chronograms” because they chronicle events with the numeric values of the Arabic letters in their last lines, a subset of these had long been dedicated to inaugurating a building and celebrating the generosity of the patron. In the eighteenth century, this simple encomium ballooned in length as in prestige, and most of the additional verses were now dedicated to lavish architectural description. The extensive new range of commentary is given almost quantifiable scope by Hamadeh’s compilation of an invaluable glossary of architectural terms found in the poems. Delving yet further into the poetic texts, Hamadeh outlines basic parameters of the architectural (and poetic) aesthetic that had overturned the classical modes.</p>
<p>Borrowing a term from Suraiya Faroqhi, Hamadeh thematizes these decades as undergoing a process of “<italic>décloisonnement</italic>,” an “opening up” of relations between social classes and hierarchies. The role of the sultanate in this process is somewhat ambivalent: on one hand, the ruling class created many urban and suburban environments that facilitated <italic>décloisonnement</italic>, but on the other, it was in their interest to maintain traditional hierarchies and orders of empire. Hamadeh negotiates this paradox astutely, presenting a balanced account of what seemingly was itself an effort to maintain a flexible balance of power and prestige in a rapidly shifting society. In Hamadeh’s image, a “wearing out” of the respective symbols of status and position accompanied these social transformations, and in the course, Ottoman rulership recast its own image, forever ending legitimizing traditions that had begun with Mehmed II.</p>
<p>Hamadeh illustrates this first in her account of suburban garden palaces. These had been built by earlier sultans, but eighteenth-century examples differed in several respects: their sheer numbers (over 300 built in the century), their concentration on the already more developed European side of the Bosporus, their expanding range of patrons, and their layouts. The ideal of the invisible but omnipresent Sultan intimated in Topkapı Palace layout (and in classical garden palace retreats as well) is overturned in favor of an aesthetic of openness and exposure. Situated often directly on the shoreline, kiosks cantilevered over the water, pierced with an “infinité de fenêtres,” as one commentator put it (p. 67), these were readily viewed by steady traffic along the Bosporus. The “exhibitionist” quality of this layout was accentuated by a remarkable architecture: the <italic>yalı</italic>, or waterfront palace, was an open timber-framed structure that allowed the maximum viewing possibilities, but also the most exposure. Adopted in significant part from middle-class examples, the <italic>yalı</italic> is not the last royal appropriation from below Hamadeh will show us.</p>
<p>Garden placement and layout similarly used permeable contours to enhance visual and physical access. This was reflective of a policy of visibility as of a general <italic>décloisonnement</italic>, Hamadeh argues, rather than of Westernization. Past scholarship, for instance, pointed to French “influence” on the open layout of the new suburban retreats (especially Sa’dabad). Hamadeh shows that Safavid “inspiration” is as apparent in the layouts and vogue for Persian names, and seems a more reasonable source, as the “ideator” of the most quoted Persian examples, Shah Abbas (who ruled from 1587 to 1629), was studied in new historical translations commissioned by Damad Ibrahim Pasha. In 1600, the Safavid ruler’s free and congenial manner of kingship had greatly differed from the Ottoman, but it now seems to have served as a model.</p>
<p>While the new royal gardens certainly reframed the Ottoman mode of diplomatic encounter with the West, they functioned primarily as a reconceptualized imperial visage for the Ottoman public. This policy of internal visibility could have profound urbanistic ramifications. Hamadeh sees the proliferation of garden palaces along the more populated (thus exposed) European side of the Bosporus as a creeping Islamization of the shore, as a “conquest” meant to prominently stage the royal presence, and as part of a larger imperative to tighten (those loosening) societal hierarchies. Less tangibly, this aesthetic of exposure and spectacle facilitated appreciation by the “middle classes” (a term used with appropriately cautious definition by Hamadeh) as well as their participation in similar patronage strategies. Either way, an intra-Ottoman field seems the most crucial dialogical stage.</p>
<p>Exposure signified (as well as enacted) patrimonial reinvolvement in the capital following the 1703 return of the sultanate, but the implications of beneficence were tempered with displays of power. Similarly, while their grants of Sultanic garden precincts to public usage facilitated “<italic>décloisonnement</italic>,” the Ottoman ruling class was also intent upon preserving traditional orders and so accompanied this “opening” by more stringent regulation of public gardens and promenades. Hamadeh uses graphic images and poetic accounts to show that such spaces of public leisure were worlds of unprecedented social mixing, but at the same time subject to ramped-up enforcement of codes of conduct and sumptuary regulations. From a “top-down” perspective, a crucial difference between the eighteenth and earlier centuries lay in “how urban life was now monitored, hampered, encouraged, sanctioned, and contained all at once” (p. 114).</p>
<p>Public gardens shared features with another emerging sub/urban space, the <italic>meydan</italic>, or public square, often oriented to the monumental <italic>meydan</italic> fountain, a freestanding, cubical structure reminiscent of a (garden) pavilion. Hamadeh shows that the finest of these, lavishly decorated and monumental royal commissions, were in fact latecomers, since their patronage and some of their distinctive revetment traditions had been a subroyal tradition of several decades. Like the <italic>yalı</italic>, they demonstrate a ruling-class openness to novel forms that “bubble up from below.”</p>
<p>Appropriately enough, there is a distinct sensory pleasure in the very reading of this book. The reproductions of little known manuscript images from the eighteenth century are both exquisite and of illuminating content. Extensive passages of Ottoman poetry, translated beautifully by the author, are as visually evocative as they are revealing of the changing social mores of public leisure. But the tour de force of Hamadeh’s poetic readings is of the substantial epigraphic panels, replete with architectural commentary, that adorn the <italic>meydan</italic> fountains. Hamadeh’s close reading of these and hundreds of other chronograms in manuscript allows her to reconstruct various “intentions, expressions, and meanings” of architecture and patronage and ultimately to delineate the armature of a cultural aesthetic running through eighteenth-century poetry and architecture, two arts which themselves seem to have experienced a cultural <italic>décloisonnement</italic> and intersection in this period. In both, classic and canonic forms were vigorously overturned in favor of a subjectivist aesthetic of sensory delight, whose corporeal, not metaphorical, aspects were those most valued.</p>
<p>Hamadeh’s subtly dialogical picture of internally driven transformation avoids solipsistic pitfalls. She shows Ottoman culture responding to cultural others (like the “West”) with active selectivity, not self-effacing assimilation. Interestingly, this is suggested by what the poems do not contain: mention of the cultural origins of many hybrid motifs; that is, there is little comparable with fifteenth-century court culture’s meticulous attention to Byzantine, Frankish, Persian, and other styles. In particular, the “Western” origin of motifs they nevertheless admire profusely is neglected. Now the deeper value was “novelty.” At least in architectural culture, “West” was not “best,” but its motifs, like those of others, slaked the thirst for new forms and expressions. Necipoğlu had demonstrated sixteenth-century architectural culture’s appreciation of “novelty,” but Hamadeh notes its new primacy. While earlier versions had been conceived primarily as “refinement” (nezâket) and were subordinated to traditional forms (within which novelty had been appreciated), “novelty” now became unmoored from such foundations. As in Europe, experiential criteria undermined canonic form.</p>
<p>Hamadeh thus shows that Ottoman cultural self-possession did not negate its participating in what Cemal Kafadar called “shared rhythms” with early modern Europe (nor those with the Mughal and Safavid worlds). Made musical, the image leaves room for melodic difference even as it points to a basic synchronization. Istanbul emerges in the work of Hamadeh and Kafescioğlu as a locus of cross-cultural conversation and, simultaneously, autonomous expressions of phenomena traditionally labeled “(early) modern” in the European context. What sense it makes to use this inevitably self-referential and circular term in <italic>any</italic> urban context is something now best explored through extended comparative discussions of Rome and Istanbul, Florence, Cairo, Isfahan and Paris. Already works such as those reviewed here paint urban early modernity ever more fadingly European.</p>
