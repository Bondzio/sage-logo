<p>Päijät-Häme Central Hospital, Finland—a single ear, nose, and throat (ENT) hospital department serving a population of 216,000.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599812438168">
<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Fourteen patients had a large open radical cavity with recurrent infections. Two ears had discharge and pain after simple mastoidectomy. A re-mastoidectomy included support of the cavity skin and obliteration with BG. The mean follow-up time was 2.2 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812438168">
<title>Results</title>
<p>All ears became dry. One reoperation was needed as the fascia support to the ear canal (EC) skin was too weak, and part of the BG leaked into the EC. The ear stayed dry, and the missing BG was replaced in a reoperation. A slightly short musculoperiosteal flap supported the EC skin in 1 ear. A minor amount of BG leaked into the EC. The ear stayed dry. The aim was an ample ear canal. One ear was overfilled and required meatoplasty. Simple mastoid cavities were isolated from the middle ear and become asymptomatic.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this pilot study, BG works safely and with success as an obliteration material in problematic open radical cavities. Bioactive glass seems to tolerate chronic infection in the mastoid and prevent postoperative infections.</p>

<body>
<p>Canal-wall-down (CWD) operation with open cavity can lead to burdensome postoperative treatment. An open cavity is usually chosen at high risk of residive cholesteatoma or with difficult revision surgery. The disadvantages of CWD cavities are associated with frequent cleaning of the cavity due to debris accumulation or infections and difficulties in using a hearing aid. The cavities can be decades old and still need regular cleaning and attendance.</p>
<p>A revision surgery to make a closed or smaller cavity and to eradicate the infection source is a tempting but challenging choice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812438168">1</xref></sup> In cases of very large cavities, it is difficult to find enough autologous tissue for the obliteration. Most obliteration materials have a tendency to shrink and resorb,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812438168">2</xref></sup> and there is a risk of postoperative infection. The result can be a difficult-to-treat discharge that extrudes the obliteration material and leads to a new operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812438168">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>To eliminate these problems, a wide variety of autologous materials have been used to obliterate the mastoid cavity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812438168">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812438168"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812438168"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812438168">7</xref></sup> Although synthetic obliteration materials have been tested for decades, the results, in general, have not been satisfactory. A variety of synthetic calcium phosphate–based bone substitutes, such as hydroxyapatite, in the form of cements or granules have been used for obliteration. The results show a large variation in clinical outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812438168">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812438168"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812438168"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812438168">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>A good biomaterial should resorb over time and be replaced by autologous tissue; it should also be safe, easy to use, osteogenetic, angiogenetic, and resistant to bacterial invasion and infection. In addition, it should keep its volume over time.</p>
<p>The latest synthetic biomaterials, based on bioactive glass, have shown initial promising results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812438168">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bioactive glasses (BGs) are synthetic biocompatible osteopromotive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812438168">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812438168">14</xref></sup> bone substitutes.

<p>Bioactive glass and hydroxyapatite are both synthetic biomaterials; however, there are remarkable differences between the materials. Hydroxyapatite does not have silica (Si), which is one of the elements of bioactive glass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812438168">14</xref></sup> Synthetic hydroxyapatite is a crystalline material and often identified as a foreign body in vivo. Bioactive glass is identified as the body’s own tissue due to the natural amorphous hydroxyapatite surface that is formed in vivo. Synthetic hydroxyapatite does not possess antibacterial properties like the BGs.</p>
<p>As the glass is implanted in the bone, a rapid reaction starts at the glass surface, with subsequent formation of a Si-rich layer. A natural layer of hydroxyapatite is formed on top of this layer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812438168">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several BG compositions have been studied, and these present quite different properties in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812438168">16</xref></sup> The 2 main BGs that have been studied in vivo are S53P4 and 45S5. The principal difference between these 2 BGs is that 45S5 presents a significantly faster resorption rate compared with S53P4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812438168">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599812438168">25</xref></sup> A common feature of these BGs is that they are not toxic in contrast to many synthetic bone grafts containing aluminum.</p>
<p>The BG S53P4 has a bacterial growth–inhibiting effect on many anaerobic and aerobic bacterial species that are related to craniomaxillofacial complications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812438168">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812438168">19</xref></sup> as well as a long and well-documented history for ENT (ear, nose, and throat),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599812438168">25</xref></sup> craniomaxillofacial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599812438168">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599812438168">27</xref></sup> and orthopaedic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0194599812438168">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0194599812438168"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0194599812438168">30</xref></sup> surgery.</p>
<p>A clinical study for mastoid obliteration with bioactive glass was presented recently with a long follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0194599812438168">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this pilot study was to find out whether the BG S53P4 is a safe and usable obliteration material for problematic open cavities in CWD ears. The aim was also to find out and improve the operation procedure to gain best results. The study was researcher conducted and financed by the county hospital.</p>
<p>The BG S53P4 BonAlive (BonAlive Biomaterials Ltd, Turku, Finland) is accepted by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Union (EU) authorities for dental, maxillofacial, orthopedic, and ENT use.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was conducted in Päijät-Häme Central Hospital’s ENT department in Lahti, southern Finland. This ENT department serves 216,000 people. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Pirkanmaa Hospital District, Tampere University Hospital.</p>
<p>The material (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812438168"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) in this prospective study is 16 consecutive revision operations with mastoid obliteration since September 2007. These ears had extraordinarily problematic mastoid cavities. Earlier operations and outpatient treatment had failed to help. The patients accepted a BG operation instead of continuous outpatient treatment.</p>

<p>Six patients were male and 9 were female, with 1 of the male patients having received a revision operation. The mean age was 51.5 years (range, 15.4-77.4 years). The mean follow-up time by the end of August 2011 was 2.2 (0.6-4) years.</p>
<p>Fourteen CWD ears had very large cavities, which were extremely difficult to clean. The cleaning process was time-consuming, was often painful, and caused vertigo. All the patients had had numerous outpatient visits for cleaning and discharge. Thirteen CWD ears had shown discharge from 3 years to decades. The youngest patient (patient 16) did not have otorrhea, but the ear was extremely difficult and painful to clean. Nine ears were operated decades ago. Ten CWD ears had been operated several times. Mastoid obliteration had been performed earlier on 10 ears.</p>
<p>Patients 10 and 15 had draining from tympanostomy tubes and pain after canal-wall-up (CWU) mastoidectomy.</p>
<p>Patient 15 had 3 earlier ear operations. The mastoid cavity was obliterated with costal cartilage. There was also a fistula with drainage behind the ear. This patient had received several treatments with intravenous antibiotics. The reason for discharge and pain was chronic infection in the residual mastoid cells and the earlier obliteration material. These mastoids were obliterated with BG to eradicate the cavity as an infection source and to see whether the BG also resists chronic infection in CWU ears.</p>
<p>Numerous bacterial cultures from these patients showed mainly <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and/or various fungi.</p>
<p>The preoperative findings are illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812438168"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>.</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599812438168">
<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>The operation technique was improved during the study. The preoperative treatment is very important, and the goal was a dry ear preoperatively. New or old computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained to plan the operation.</p>
<p>The operation approach was a retroauricular skin incision.</p>
<p>A Palva-type flap was formed with attachment toward the concha. The flap size and thickness depended on the thickness of the soft tissue layer in the roof of the radical cavity.</p>
<p>Previous obliteration materials had mostly resorbed, and the remaining material was removed. The cavity was cleaned by drilling. A cutting drill was used to remove hanging rims of the mastoid and to remove residual cells. A diamond drill was used to clean and obtain healthy bone surfaces. A defocused super-pulse CO<sub>2</sub> laser, 1 to 2 watts, was used to eradicate the smallest epithelium rests. The goal was to preserve healthy mastoid cavity skin intact by carefully lifting it up from the bottom of the cavity. This skin was used as skin for the posterior ear canal (EC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812438168"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). This process was carried out up to the level of the tympanal side rim of the horizontal semicircular canal (HSC). In most cases, it was difficult to gain good access to the anterior edge of the original antrum. The antrum was left unobliterated in 12 operations from the top of the HSC to the angle between the tegmen and anterior epitympanum. In 2 ears, a tympanoplasty with a partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP)–type titanium prosthesis was performed at the end of the operation. In these ears, the antrum was also obliterated with cartilage and BG. In the 2 CWU ears, the middle ear was separated from the mastoid by cartilage.</p>

</fig>
<p>The EC skin was not cut or modeled even though it was originally too large. One or 2 expandable tampons (eg, Merocel; Medtronic, Mystic, Connecticut) were placed in the EC to gain the desirable EC form and volume.</p>
<p>The EC skin was supported with an anteriorly based Palva-type flap, temporalis fascia, or cartilage in different combinations. The flap harvested in revision surgery is as a rule too small, and the proper size is difficult to estimate. A short flap can render the EC skin bare against BG at the bottom of the cavity. The BG granules are sharp and can penetrate the EC skin if in direct contact. The skin breaks easily at the HSC level. The result is leakage of BG into the EC. This can be avoided by placing a piece of cartilage standing on the HSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812438168"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). It is of great importance to place cartilage against punctured skin.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0194599812438168-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A thin flap was placed against the EC skin in the upper part of the cavity, and a piece of cartilage was placed in the bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812438168"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). The junction between these and the cartilage can be reinforced by a piece of temporalis fascia. It is an advantage to spare the perichondrium on both sides of the cartilage. All tissues against EC must be relatively thin; otherwise, it makes obliteration with BG difficult.</p>

</fig>
<p>The obliteration was performed with bioactive glass S53P4 (BonAlive), produced by BonAlive Biomaterials Ltd. The granule size was 0.5 to 0.8 mm in 8 operations and 0.8 to 1.0 mm in 8 operations. It is important to moisten the BG granules with NaCl 0.9% solution to get a proper consistency of the granules for application and to start the surface reactions. The BG must be packed tightly to fully obliterate the cavity. The obliteration was performed to the level of the planum mastoideum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599812438168"><bold>Figures 4</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599812438168"><bold>5</bold></xref>). The volume of BG will not shrink over time, so it is important to not overfill the ear canal. When the obliteration is ready, it is advisable to remove temporarily the tamponade from the EC to check and adjust the desired volume and form. The EC skin was lined with 0.13-mm-thick silicone sheets.</p>

<p>At the end of the operation, the BG was suctioned dry from saline solution. The BG was then filled with tissue glue (Tisseel, Baxter, Wien, Austria) to stabilize the filling.</p>
<p>The reasons for persistent infection after earlier operations were inadequate or resorbed obliteration, infection in the residual cells and mastoid structures, or a combination of these.</p>
<p>All patients received postoperative antibiotics first intravenously during the 2-day ward time and then orally for 1 week according to the bacterial culture. The peroral antibiotic was changed to intravenous treatment at the slightest sign of infection.</p>
<p>The patients came to outpatient visits at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively and thereafter every half-year until the patients had asymptomatic ears. After all wounds had healed, the patients were allowed to shower without ear plugs, but they were not allowed to swim without ear protection.</p>
<p>To avoid excess radiation, routine postoperative CT scans were not planned during this pilot.</p>
<p>The following grading system was used to estimate the outcome. The result was counted as a success if</p>

<p>All ears became dry within a month after the BG obliteration. It was possible to cease the regular outpatient cleaning visits for 11 patients after the follow-up of 1 year. Later these patients only attended the study follow-up. This was a very clear difference compared with the earlier numerous outpatient visits, which did not make the ears dry or asymptomatic.

<p>Abbreviations: HA, hearing aid; M, meatoplasty; N, narrow; NA, not applicable; SP, success points (average 2.8); T, tympanoplasty. The success points are as follows: (1) the ear stayed dry and asymptomatic for over a year (1 success point), (2) there was an easy view into the ear canal (the ear canal form was a smoothly inward expanding cone) and no hidden pouches (1 success point), (3) normal ear canal skin was observed (1 success point), and (4) tympanoplasty was performed pre- or postoperatively or use of a hearing aid became possible (1 success point).</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Three patients received tympanoplasty after the ears became dry. Two patients (patients 8 and 16) received a PORP titanium prosthesis simultaneously with the obliteration with BG. The patients who had a hearing aid could use it normally when the ear became dry. Air and bone conduction hearing was tested pre- and postoperatively. Hearing was unchanged for the 14 ears without middle ear operation. Hearing improved for the 2 ears that received a PORP titanium prosthesis (pure-tone average [PTA] 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz: patient 8: preoperative 45 dB, postoperative 30 dB; patient 16: preoperative 40 dB, postoperative 28 dB).</p>
<p>The only EC skin support that was not reliable was a single layer of fascia. All other reconstruction materials worked, also in combination. The summary of EC reconstruction materials is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599812438168"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>. One revision was needed as the EC skin was only supported by a single layer of fascia (patient 4). The EC skin ruptured, and part of the BG leaked for several weeks into the EC. The ear remained dry and did not show signs of infection or discharge. However, it was not counted as a success in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812438168"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>. The BG granules could be suctioned away from the ear canal. During revision surgery, the rest of the BG was found well vascularized and bony in consistence 1.4 years postoperatively, and the missing volume of BG could be replaced. Another patient had a flap that was too short, and some BG leaked for several weeks through a perforation in the skin into the EC (patient 6). This ear also stayed dry and did not show signs of infection or discharge. The fistula in the EC skin was later closed with cartilage during a tympanoplasty. The same patient had a dry, small dimple in the retroauricular skin scar, which was removed in connection with the tympanoplasty.</p>

<p>The surgical findings, reconstruction of the ear canal, and immediate postoperative follow-up are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599812438168"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>.</p>
<p>Six patients had immediately postoperatively some form of discharge from the ear canal or retroauricular cut. Two ears had mild infections, which ceased with local treatment. Four patients needed intravenous antibiotics for 1 week, which ceased the infection. The infections caused no extrusion of the BG obliteration.</p>
<p>The retroauricular skin was slightly swollen and tender 1 to 2 weeks postoperatively, and the soft BG could be felt in the cavity. By 1 month, the palpation finding was solid.</p>

<sec id="section10-0194599812438168" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many open cavities are harmless and do not need any treatment. It is possible to obliterate radical cavities and mastoids with autologous tissue without problems. However, without an outstanding biological material, the most difficult mastoids remain unobliterated. Obliteration is often the bottleneck needed to pass to make progress in treatment. Hearing aid use in ears with a huge cavity and thumb-large meatus is almost impossible. Tympanoplasty is also not feasible without some kind of ear canal to reconstruct a normal-size tympanum. Patients with problematic open mastoids suffer a substantial loss of quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0194599812438168">32</xref></sup> These mastoids are an economic problem to patients, insurance companies, and many ENT outpatient clinics.</p>
<p>The good results of this study come partly from the meticulous treatment and follow-up procedure. Most patients had a long history of cleaning problems and treatment-resistant repeated otorrhea. Compared with this history, the difference after surgery was obvious. This is also illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812438168"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>, with success points clearly above average for most patients. Three ears had less than 1 year follow-up by September 2011, and therefore they have no follow-up success points in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812438168"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>. These 3 ears reduce the average success score to 2.8, which is good.</p>
<p>The study group was deliberately kept relatively small. The reason was safety. Only several years follow-up brings forth possible adverse events of nonautologous materials. The time span between the first 5 patients and the others was, therefore, relatively long.</p>
<p>Extrusion of the infected material is often seen in biomaterial-associated infections. The BG was exposed to the EC environment in 2 ears without clinical signs of infection. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599812438168"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref> also illustrates that ruptured mastoid cavity skin was only rarely linked with postoperative signs of infection. This can be attributed to the antibacterial activity of BG. Although the number of cases is small, it suits the concept that BG really is antimicrobial. This is in concordance with the in vitro studies.</p>
<p>The 2 CWU ears were included to see if BG presents similar antimicrobial properties in closed cavities. The healing of these 2 ears gives extra support to antimicrobial properties of BG in vivo.</p>
<p>The BG S53P4 does not shrink after implantation. This is important for retaining the anatomically suitable volume in the obliterated area. Although BG S53P4 is a resorbable material, it does not resorb before new bone has formed.</p>
<p>The original anterior part of the antrum and the attic easily get behind a corner of the overfilled EC. It is important to keep in mind that if the surgeon tries to gain a “normal”-size EC, it tends to become too narrow. The antrum was left unobliterated also because of safety reasons. Many residues appear in this region, probably because of the complicated anatomy. Incomplete obliteration of the antrum can leave tissue fluid-filled pouches in this area, which can become new sources of infection. Even though the EC was larger than normal in this area, it did not cause problems in this series.</p>
<p>According to this pilot study, the S53P4 fulfills the criteria of being a good biomaterial for mastoid obliteration. The antibacterial property of BG S53P4 seemed to decrease the risk of postoperative infection and extrusion of the obliteration material during this follow-up. There is a clear indication to carry out further clinical research with this synthetic bone graft substitute in ear surgery. The follow-up for these patients is designed to last up to 5 years, and CT and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging controls are planned in the future.</p>
