<abstract>
<p>This article investigates father and offspring criminal careers by employing the semi-parametric, group-based trajectories methodology. The findings demonstrate that children of sporadic and chronic offenders have significantly more convictions than children of non-offenders. However, contrary to expectations based on taxonomic and intergenerational theories, chronic offending fathers do not have more chronic offending children than sporadic fathers. The results demonstrate strong intergenerational transmission of criminal behaviour, but it is the fathers having a conviction rather than their conviction trajectory that is related to offspring convictions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Children whose parents exhibit criminal behaviour have a higher risk of becoming criminal themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370811422801">Farrington, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1477370811422801">Thornberry, 2009</xref>). Criminal parents appear to be the strongest family factor predicting offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370811422801">Farrington, 2011</xref>). It is still unclear why this happens. Most studies investigating intergenerational transmission simply link any lifetime offending of the parent to any lifetime offending of the child. In order to investigate what explains intergenerational transmission, however, it is important to examine both the <italic>timing</italic> of parental criminality as well as the <italic>intensity</italic>. Not only the fact that parents have a conviction, but criminal career parameters such as the age of onset, peak offending age and conviction frequency might be important in explaining transmission of criminal behaviour to children. This article aims to explore the intergenerational transmission of criminal behaviour by investigating specifically the timing and volume of criminal behaviour in parents and children by employing the semi-parametric, group-based trajectories methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370811422801">Nagin, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370811422801">Farrington (2011)</xref> described six explanations for the intergenerational transmission of criminal behaviour: intergenerational exposure to multiple risk factors, mediation through environmental risk factors, teaching and co-offending, genetic mechanisms, assortative mating<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1477370811422801">1</xref></sup> and official (police and justice) bias. These explanations are not mutually exclusive and they are empirically intertwined; a combination of these mechanisms could explain intergenerational transmission. Exactly which of these mechanisms is responsible for intergenerational transmission has not been assessed conclusively. Based on these mechanisms, however, one would expect intergenerational transmission to be stronger for more persistent offenders. For example, if social learning were the mechanism responsible for transmission, children whose parents are more frequent offenders would have an increased risk of offending themselves. The social learning mechanism explains transmission through direct and mutual influences of family members on each other; the parent is a social role model for the children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477370811422801">Bandura, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477370811422801">1977</xref>). Moreover, according to Sutherland’s Differential Association Theory, people will commit delinquent acts when they have learned more motivations to break rather than to follow the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1477370811422801">Sutherland and Cressey, 1955</xref>). When parents are more frequent offenders, children have more opportunities to observe and imitate their parents’ delinquent behaviour and motivations and thus one would expect more offspring crime. Similarly, one would expect more official bias, a stronger biological basis and more risk factors when parents are more persistent offenders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1477370811422801">Thornberry (2005)</xref> also hypothesizes that more frequent and persistent offenders will transmit criminal behaviour to their children more strongly. Parents’ delinquency has a strong effect on their own development, transition into adult roles, parenting styles and thereby the effectiveness of their parenting, which in turn will increase the risk that their children will develop criminal behaviour.</p>
<p>Apart from studying the intensity of parents’ offending, it is important to consider the timing. Deviant behaviour peaks in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1477370811422801">Piquero et al., 2007</xref>) and it is quite common to display some antisocial behaviour during this period. It is, however, a sign of greater deviance if such behaviour continues after adolescence or starts in adulthood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370811422801">Moffitt (1993)</xref> describes this as adolescence-limited versus life-course persistent offenders. According to Moffitt, many adolescents display antisocial behaviour to bridge a temporary ‘maturity gap’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370811422801">1993</xref>: 674). They actually mimic the behaviour of life-course persistents offenders, who have been displaying antisocial behaviour since they were much younger. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370811422801">Moffitt (1993)</xref> states that life-course-persistents’ antisocial behaviour has an early onset and will continue until much later in life owing to biological and neuropsychological problems. Her theory is linked to ideas of grouping offenders according to different life-course trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1477370811422801">Nagin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477370811422801">Nagin and Land, 1993</xref>). Depending on the population studied, three to six groups of offenders have been identified: one group will never be convicted, one or more groups will display antisocial behaviour only during adolescence (the earlier mentioned adolescence-limiteds), one or more groups will exhibit delinquent behaviour throughout their lives (either low- or high-level chronics) and there might be a late-onset group of offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477370811422801">Blokland et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477370811422801">Fergusson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1477370811422801">Nagin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477370811422801">Nagin and Land, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1477370811422801">Piquero 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1477370811422801">Van der Geest et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1477370811422801">Wiesner and Windle, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to deal with behavioural heterogeneity that might exist in a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1477370811422801">Piquero et al., 2001</xref>). Different groups of people might follow different patterns of criminal behaviour. These various developmental pathways might require different etiological explanations. Farrington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477370811422801">1999</xref>: 156) states that ‘most prior criminal career research treats offenders as homogeneous, but different types of people may have different types of careers. . . . Research is needed on what are the most useful typologies of offenders, and on their different developmental pathways to criminal careers.’</p>
<p>Similarly, intergenerational transmission might be different for parents with different criminal behaviour trajectories. For example, based on Moffitt’s theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370811422801">1993</xref>), one would expect intergenerational transmission to be stronger for life-course-persistent than for adolescence-limited parents for three reasons. First, her theory explains life-course-persistents’ antisocial behaviour as having a biological origin and this hereditary basis could be passed on to children. Some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1477370811422801">Waldman et al., 1995</xref>, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1477370811422801">Rhee and Waldman, 2002</xref>) indeed found that antisocial behaviour that is earlier in onset is more heritable, but others did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1477370811422801">Slutske et al., 1997</xref>). Second, a life-course-persistent parent will display more delinquent behaviour and will therefore be a stronger criminal role model for children according to social learning theories. Third, as mentioned before, police and justice bodies will be more strongly biased against families with life-course-persistent offenders. With life-course-persistent parents we thus expect a stronger <italic>nurture</italic> as well as <italic>nature</italic> base of this behaviour and therefore a stronger transmission impact.</p>
<p>By investigating whether intergenerational transmission is different for people whose parents have different conviction trajectories, this article aims to link research into criminal careers and life-course trajectories with the study of intergenerational transmission. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1477370811422801">West and Farrington (1977)</xref> previously studied the impact of the number of parental convictions in the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development. They found that fathers with only one conviction and fathers with two or more convictions had the same proportion of convicted sons. However, they did not examine the trajectory of these convictions. Previous research in intergenerational transmission often relates any lifetime offending by the parent to any lifetime offending by the child (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370811422801">Farrington et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1477370811422801">Rowe and Farrington, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1477370811422801">Thornberry, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1477370811422801">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>). An exception is the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1477370811422801">Van de Rakt et al. (2008)</xref>, who investigated the trajectories of both parents and children. They found that children whose fathers belong to a more persistent trajectory group are more likely also to be in such a trajectory group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1477370811422801">Slutske et al. (1997)</xref> also found that persistent antisocial behaviour is more heritable than antisocial behaviour that is limited to either childhood or adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1477370811422801">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1477370811422801">Van de Rakt et al. (2008)</xref>, however, do not test whether the relationship between the trajectories of fathers and children is significant, nor do they give an effect size for this relationship. These authors observe that more research on this topic is needed; replication of the results would be desirable. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1477370811422801">Van de Rakt et al. (2008)</xref> describe several disadvantages of previous studies in intergenerational transmission, such as small samples and retrospective designs, no measures of parental influence on their children after adolescence, lack of females in the sample, lack of a control group, and an abundance of descriptive tests without any theory testing. In line with this, the current article will investigate intergenerational transmission in trajectories using the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development in an attempt to overcome some of these disadvantages.</p>
<p>Previous studies linking any lifetime offending of the parents and children or using a summary variable for offending by parents and children make inefficient use of longitudinal data. By employing trajectory analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370811422801">Nagin, 2005</xref>) to link parents’ and children’s criminal behaviour, better use is made of longitudinal data. This approach is an important advance because it captures the dynamic dimension of offending behaviour by summarizing its developmental course in the form of trajectory groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370811422801">Nagin, 2005</xref>). As Nagin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370811422801">2005</xref>: 146) argues, the ‘result is a far richer summary of the pattern of interconnection’ in the developmental course of parents’ and children’s behaviour. The following hypotheses will be tested in this article using this method.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>These hypotheses are investigated using data from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD), a prospective longitudinal study that has followed 411 males from London born around 1953. At the time they were first contacted in 1961–2, these males were all living in a working-class inner-city area of south London. The sample was chosen by taking all of the boys who were then aged 8–9 and on the registers of six state primary schools within a one-mile radius of a research office that had been established. Hence, the most common year of birth for these males was 1953. In nearly all cases (94 percent), their family breadwinner in 1961–2 (usually the father) had a working-class occupation (skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled manual worker). Most of the boys were white and of British origin. Donald J. West originally directed the study and David P. Farrington, who has worked on it since 1969, has directed it since 1982. The males have been studied at frequent intervals between the ages of 8 and 50. Information on criminal convictions and self-reported delinquency was collected over the course of these years. Additionally, police records of offending of the parents and siblings of these 411 males have been collected. For the current study, only the police records were being used, because self-reports were not available for parents and siblings. For further information and major findings, see West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1477370811422801">1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1477370811422801">1982</xref>), West and Farrington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1477370811422801">1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1477370811422801">1977</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370811422801">Farrington and West (1990)</xref>, Farrington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370811422801">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370811422801">2003</xref>) and Farrington et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477370811422801">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477370811422801">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The current investigation studied the original men, their fathers and their siblings. Investigating the siblings increased the sample size and enabled a broadening of the analysis to include gender differences because females were included. A sample was taken from the siblings – people born between January 1946 and September 1962. The last criminal record search for siblings took place in September 2002. Choosing this date limit made it possible to investigate conviction data for all subjects up to their 40th birthday. This birth range resulted in a sample of 1184 children (402 females and 782 males, including the original men). Because the data collection started with families that had at least one boy born in 1953–4, the data set did not contain families with girls only. Therefore the proportion of males to females in the current sample was approximately 2:1.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1477370811422801">
<title>Criminal convictions</title>
<p>Offending of both fathers and offspring was measured using official criminal records. Convictions were sought in the Criminal Record Office in London (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811422801">Farrington et al., 1996</xref>). The date when the offence was committed was used to time the delinquency. If no commission date was known, the conviction date was used. Offences were defined as acts leading to convictions, and only one offence per day (the most serious) was counted. This rule was adopted so that each separate behavioural act could yield only one offence; if all offences had been counted, the number of offences would have been greater than the number of criminal behavioural acts, resulting in an overestimation of criminal behavioural acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477370811422801">Farrington et al., 2006</xref>). Convictions were counted for relatively serious offending, ranging from theft, burglary and fraud to robbery, sexual offences and murder. Minor offences such as drunkenness and traffic offences were excluded.</p>
<p>For both fathers and offspring, convictions for offences committed between the 12th and 40th birthday were counted. Thus, an offender in this article is defined as someone who had been convicted of an offence between these ages. Using such a comparable measure follows Thornberry’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1477370811422801">2009</xref>: 300) design criteria stating that ‘intergenerational studies should have comparable measures of G2 and G3 antisocial behavior that cover the same ages or the same developmental stages’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1477370811422801">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Analytic approach</title>
<sec id="section9-1477370811422801">
<title>Semi-parametric group-based trajectory modelling</title>
<p>Group-based modelling was performed using the SAS macro <italic>proc traj</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1477370811422801">Jones and Nagin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370811422801">Jones et al., 2001</xref>). Separate trajectories were estimated for fathers, sons and daughters. Rather than assuming an average age–crime curve for every individual, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477370811422801">Nagin and Land’s (1993)</xref> semi-parametric group-based modelling approach identifies a number of different groups of individuals who display similar behavioural trajectories. This technique allows variation between groups of individuals and allows for different age–crime curves. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1477370811422801">Nagin (2004a)</xref> for a non-technical overview of the group-based modelling technique.</p>
<p>A zero-inflated Poisson model was used, because convictions are relatively rare events and therefore the distribution of the number of convictions is skewed; that is, there are many people with zero convictions or a low number of convictions. Using an inflation parameter allows subjects to have ‘“temporary” spells of non-offending without recording a change in their overall rate of offending’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370811422801">Bushway et al., 2003</xref>: 138).</p>
<p>If people died or were in prison for a whole year during the observation period, that is, before the age of 40, this was controlled for; unobserved years were coded as missing and did not contribute to estimating the trajectories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1477370811422801">6</xref></sup> It is important to control for mortality to prevent the problem of ‘false desistance’ where it would look as though someone had desisted whereas in fact the person had passed away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477370811422801">Eggleston et al., 2004</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>The goal of trajectory analysis is to find the optimal solution where groups of individuals with distinctive individual-level trajectories can be identified but where adding an additional group to the model offers no extra explanatory power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370811422801">Nagin, 2005</xref>). This is done using formal statistical criteria and subjective judgement. The test used to determine the optimal number of groups is the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). BIC gives an indication of model fit based on differences between the estimated model and the observations, but also corrects for the number of parameters fitted and for the number of observations. BIC estimates model fit but also looks at how parsimonious the model is. For deciding on the number of classes, one chooses the model that maximizes BIC and, because BIC is always negative, this will be the value closest to 0. This number is an indicator of the difference between the model and the observed data and that difference should be as small as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811422801">D’Unger et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>Proc traj</italic> produces two BIC values: one for a smaller sample size, one for a larger sample size. The smaller sample size reflects the number of people in the sample; the larger sample size pertains to the total number of assessments used in the model estimation across individuals and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370811422801">Nagin, 2005</xref>). So, in this case, the larger sample size will be the number of people multiplied by the number of years for which we know their number of convictions (every year from age 12 to age 39). Neither BIC value is better than the other; it is important to take both into account. If the BIC values pointed to different models as the optimal solution, we chose the model that was most parsimonious – the model with the lowest number of trajectory groups. Furthermore, the content and shape of the trajectories are important in the choice and interpretation of the models. Models with trajectories that have no reasonable interpretation or with trajectories that are not distinctive are of little use. Hence, after inspecting the BIC, it is important to inspect the content and shape of the trajectories.</p>
<p>After estimating which model describes the sample best, it is possible to use the <italic>posterior</italic> probability of group membership to measure the probability that an individual might belong to a specific trajectory group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370811422801">Nagin, 2005</xref>). Using the highest probability, <italic>proc traj</italic> will assign every individual to a specific group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1477370811422801">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)</title>
<p>After assigning people to classes, the hypotheses were analysed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) in SPSS (for more technical information on GEE, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1477370811422801">Lipsitz et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1477370811422801">Zeger and Liang, 1992</xref>).

It weights each cluster of data according to the within-cluster correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477370811422801">Hanley et al., 2003</xref>). When there is no correlation between family members, the cluster receives a weight of 1 and cluster members are treated as though they were independent subjects. Highly correlated siblings receive a lower weight. Using these weights, GEE then analyses the relationships between the variables considering the dependencies within clusters. GEE can deal with a large number of small clusters and is therefore especially suited for the current data with a large number of families, generally consisting of fewer than 10 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1477370811422801">Liang and Zeger, 1993</xref>). Within GEE it is possible to choose different analytical models. For Hypothesis 1, negative binomial regression was used, because the dependent variable frequency of offspring offending was highly skewed: many people had never been convicted. With such a skewed distribution it was inappropriate to run a linear regression analysis. Negative binomial regression analysis deals suitably with skewed distributions. To compare fathers’ and offspring’s trajectories (Hypothesis 2) ordinal probit regression was used, which gives a χ<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1477370811422801">2</xref></sup>. Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup> test examines whether two categorical variables, in this case the father’s and the child’s trajectory memberships, are related to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477370811422801">Field, 2005</xref>). Adjusted standardized residuals (ASRs) were calculated to identify which groups were responsible for significant differences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1477370811422801">8</xref></sup> A residual greater than 2.0 was considered to indicate a significantly higher proportion, and a residual less than −2.0 was taken to indicate a significantly lower proportion than expected if there was no relationship between fathers’ and offspring’s trajectory groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477370811422801">Bursik, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370811422801">Haberman, 1973</xref>). Furthermore, odds ratios were calculated to test whether different types of father offending trajectories predict different types of offspring offending trajectories (Hypothesis 4).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this section, we first present the model estimation for fathers, after which we compare children of the different groups of fathers. After then estimating models for sons and daughters, the resemblance between trajectories of fathers and sons and of fathers and daughters is presented.</p>
<sec id="section12-1477370811422801">
<title>Fathers’ conviction trajectories</title>
<p>In our sample of 397 fathers, 92 (23.2 percent) had a conviction between their 12th and 40th birthdays. Of the convicted fathers, 53.2 percent had one conviction, 19.6 percent had two convictions, 15.2 percent had three to five convictions and 12.0 percent had six convictions or more.</p>
<p>First, trajectories for fathers were estimated. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370811422801">Nagin (2005)</xref>, model selection consisted of two steps. Our model estimation began with models comprising three groups or more. In the first step a decision was made about the number of groups in the model. The second step concerned the shape of each group’s trajectory within the chosen model. A trajectory shape can be zero (non-offending), flat, linear, quadratic or cubic (for more technical information see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370811422801">Nagin, 2005</xref>). In our first step, the model search began with models composed of quadratic trajectories. The low BIC pointed towards a four-group model, the high BIC led to a three-group model (see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1477370811422801">appendix</xref>). In the second step, three group models with different kinds of trajectories were estimated. A three-group model with one non-offending (with an actual and predicted delinquency of 0), one intercept-only and one quadratic trajectory appeared to be the best estimation for this sample of fathers.</p>
<p>The resulting model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477370811422801">Figure 1</xref>. For ease of reporting, the three groups are labelled as follows: non-offending fathers (NO), low chronic or sporadic offenders (LC) and chronic offenders (CO). Non-offending fathers (76.8 percent) had no convictions. Sporadic offenders (18.9 percent) had on average 1.5 convictions. Chronic offenders (4.3 percent) had relatively many convictions (on average 6.5) over the whole observation period, with a peak during the late teens and early twenties.</p>

<title>Offspring offending behaviour per father trajectory group</title>
<p>Children of sporadic and chronic fathers have a higher conviction rate than children of non-offenders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477370811422801">Table 1</xref>). However, the difference in conviction rate between children of LC and CO fathers is not significant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1477370811422801">9</xref></sup> Our first hypothesis was that children of more persistent offenders will have more convictions than children of more sporadic offending fathers. The groups we found in our sample cannot necessarily be described as the adolescent-limited and life-course persistent groups described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370811422801">Moffitt (1993)</xref>, because our sporadic offender group tends to offend during the whole lifetime. One could say, however, that our sporadic offender group is a less serious group than the chronic offenders group and, hence, one could expect stronger intergenerational transmission. However, our results do not provide convincing evidence for this hypothesis because there is no significant difference between children of sporadic and chronic offenders.</p>

<title>Sons’ conviction trajectories</title>
<p>To test the other hypotheses, conviction trajectories were estimated for sons and daughters. The sample contained 782 sons, of whom 323 (41.3 percent) had a conviction between their 12th and 40th birthdays.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1477370811422801">10</xref></sup> Of the convicted sons, 35.6 percent had one conviction, 18.3 percent had two convictions, 21.0 percent had three to five convictions and 25.1 percent had six convictions or more.</p>
<p>In the first step of model estimation for sons, a five-group model resulted in the best BIC value (see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1477370811422801">appendix</xref>). In the second step, several five-group models were compared and a model with two flat and three quadratic lines gave the best BIC value for this sample of sons. The resulting model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477370811422801">Figure 2</xref>. The five groups are labelled as follows: non-offenders (63.0 percent), who had no or a single conviction; low desisters (21.9 percent), who had on average 2 convictions during their teens and early twenties and then desisted from committing crime; low chronic offenders (7.4 percent), who continued to have convictions (on average 5) over the whole life-course; high desisters (4.9 percent), who had relatively many convictions (on average 11) during their teens and early twenties and then desisted; and chronic offenders (2.8 percent), who had relatively many convictions (on average 18) over the whole observation period, with a peak during the late teens and early twenties.

<p>After modelling offspring trajectories, these were compared with fathers’ trajectories. The proportions of sons for every combination of father and son trajectory group are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477370811422801">Table 2</xref>. The proportions of sons per group of fathers and the ASRs are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477370811422801">Table 3</xref>.

This value, however, gives an indication for the whole table but does not say much about the specific relationship. The ASRs demonstrate that non-offending fathers have a significantly higher proportion of non-offending (NO) sons and a significantly lower proportion of high desisting (HD) and high chronic offending (CO) sons. This pattern is reversed for chronic offending fathers; they have a significantly higher proportion of HD and CO sons, but a significantly lower proportion of NO sons. Low chronic offending (LC) fathers have a significantly lower proportion of NO sons and a significantly higher proportion of CO sons. LC fathers appear to have a higher proportion of LC and HD sons than expected, but this is not significant. Moreover, the proportions of LC or HD sons among LC fathers and CO fathers do not differ significantly from each other (7.9 percent versus 13.5 percent and 5.1 percent versus 11.5 percent, OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 0.60–6.10, and OR = 2.43, 95% CI: 0.70–8.48).

<p>The significant χ<sup>2</sup> confirms our second hypothesis that father and son trajectories are similar. Furthermore, the ASRs show that non-offending fathers tend to predict non-offending sons, which confirms our third hypothesis. However, the odds ratios do not support our fourth hypothesis that different types of father offending trajectories predict different types of offspring offending trajectories.</p>
<p>A similar pattern was visible for fathers and daughters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1477370811422801">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1477370811422801">5</xref>). The association between fathers’ and daughters’ trajectories is significant (χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 13.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The ASRs demonstrate that non-offending fathers have a significantly higher proportion of non-offending daughters than expected by chance. Chronic offending fathers have a significantly higher proportion of low desisting daughters. This proportion of LD daughters is also significantly higher than the proportion of LD daughters among LC fathers (30.8 percent versus 12.6 percent, OR = 2.99, 95% CI: 1.03–8.68). Again though, similarly to fathers’ and sons’ trajectories, CO fathers do not predict CO daughters better than LC fathers. The significant relationship can be attributed mostly to the fact that non-offending fathers have non-offending daughters, whereas offending fathers (LC and CO) have offending daughters. The results for daughters also confirm Hypotheses 2 and 3 but not Hypothesis 4. The odds ratios actually show a counterintuitive result: chronic offending fathers predict low desisting daughters.</p>

<p>Even though the GEE analyses demonstrate a significant relationship between fathers’ and children’s offending trajectories, more detailed analysis of the separate cells does not support the hypothesis that specific father offending trajectories predict similar specific offspring offending trajectories. They confirm the previous results for Hypothesis 1 that children of fathers who have a more chronic conviction trajectory do not show more criminal behaviour than children of sporadic offending fathers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated intergenerational transmission by employing the group-based trajectories methodology. We found three types of trajectories for fathers: non-offenders, low chronic or sporadic offenders, and chronic offenders. Among daughters we identified three types: non-offenders, low desisters, and chronic offenders. We identified two additional groups among sons: low chronic offenders and high desisters. The main conclusions of this article are:</p>
<list id="list2-1477370811422801" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Children of more persistent offending fathers do not have more convictions than children of sporadic offending fathers. Children of LC and CO fathers have significantly more convictions than children of NO fathers, but children of LC fathers do not differ significantly from children of CO fathers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Although father and offspring trajectories look similar, the significant relationship can be explained by the observation that non-offending father trajectories tend to predict non-offending child trajectories.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Chronic offending fathers do not predict chronic offending or high desisting sons better than sporadic fathers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Surprisingly, chronic offending fathers predict low desisting daughters better than sporadic fathers. This is a result we did not expect based on the intergenerational theories.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The general conclusion from this study is that, surprisingly, the intensity of the father’s career does not predict the intensity of the child’s career. The results demonstrate a strong intergenerational transmission of criminal behaviour, but offspring convictions are related to the fact that fathers have a conviction rather than to what their conviction trajectory looks like. This confirms previous analyses with the CSDD original men comparing fathers with one conviction in adulthood or convictions as a juvenile only with fathers with two convictions or more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1477370811422801">West and Farrington, 1977</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1477370811422801">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>What do these results mean for theories of intergenerational transmission? They confirm previous findings (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370811422801">Bijleveld and Wijkman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370811422801">Farrington et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477370811422801">Ferguson, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1477370811422801">Gorman-Smith et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1477370811422801">Rowe and Farrington, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1477370811422801">Thornberry, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1477370811422801">Wilson, 1975</xref>) demonstrating that having a convicted father increases the chance and the number of offspring convictions. However, contrary to what we expected based on taxonomic theories and theories on intergenerational transmission, there is no difference between children of sporadic and more persistent offenders. The trajectories found for fathers did not resemble the adolescent-limited versus life-course persistent offender groups as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370811422801">Moffitt (1993)</xref>. However, the results did reveal two distinct offending trajectories, one of which showed more chronic and frequent offending, but children of these chronic offenders did not show significantly more criminal behaviour than children of sporadic offenders. This study was not able to test theories directly, but the results do not support the stronger biological, social learning and official bias influence as hypothesized in the introduction. Furthermore, in terms of policy interventions, it appears that no distinction should be made between sporadic and persistent offenders if we want to prevent intergenerational transmission. Family-based prevention programmes such as parent education and parent management training that have been shown to be effective in reducing offspring offending behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477370811422801">Farrington and Welsh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1477370811422801">Kazdin, 1997</xref>) could be offered to all fathers with a conviction, regardless of how many convictions they have.</p>
<p>This study undoubtedly has limitations. First, only official data have been used and these suffer from a ‘dark number’ – the part of offending that is not measured by official statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477370811422801">Fisher and Ross, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1477370811422801">Maguire, 2007</xref>). This means that we may see only part of people’s total offending behaviour, we see the tip of the iceberg. People are likely to exhibit more offending behaviour that is invisible to the police, and many people will never appear in official statistics even though they have exhibited criminal behaviour. Official convictions are only indicators of offending behaviour. Furthermore, the difference between official convictions and self-reported offending might be different for people with different conviction trajectories. Perhaps persistent offenders commit relatively more unseen offences compared with sporadic offenders. Or, seemingly adolescent-limited offenders might have learned better how to avoid getting caught. People who are included in the offending trajectories all have at least one conviction and thereby they are more homogeneous than the whole sample of fathers. We could not discriminate or measure the offending of fathers without a conviction. It is likely that there are fathers without a conviction who have actually shown some kind of delinquent behaviour. If one used self-report data on offending, this would lead to a finer gradation of the volume and timing of offending and it is possible that this would lead to different results. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate trajectories of offending with self-reported data on offending behaviour for both generations.</p>
<p>Secondly, our sample is relatively small, especially for females. More trajectory groups tend to be found when a sample consists of more convicted individuals and more measurements per individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811422801">D’Unger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477370811422801">Eggleston et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477370811422801">Nagin and Tremblay, 2005a</xref>). Generally, the number of groups identified is stable with a sample over 300–500 individuals, so our sample size should be large enough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477370811422801">Nagin and Tremblay, 2005a</xref>). The difference in the number of trajectory groups between sons versus fathers and daughters, however, could possibly be explained by the fact that the sample of sons is twice as large and that sons have more convictions than daughters or fathers. The number of mothers with convictions was even smaller – too small to identify a reliable model. It is unfortunate that we were not able to examine mothers’ trajectories, because intergenerational mechanisms might be different for males and females. Behaviour could be more strongly transmitted in same-gender relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811422801">Farrington et al., 1996</xref>). Most children are more exposed to their mother’s behaviour. Furthermore, convictions for women are less common. Being such an exception might lead to more stigma in society and official bodies such as the police might pay more attention to these women and their families. They may also be labelled as disturbed rather than criminal. According to labelling theory, people behave according to the label society attaches to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477370811422801">Lemert, 1967</xref>). Additionally, Sherman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1477370811422801">1993</xref>: 459) hypothesized that persistent police action might lead to ‘defiance’, a ‘proud and angry emotion’ that can result in antisocial behaviour. Accordingly, it would be interesting to see whether investigating the intergenerational resemblance of conviction trajectories between mothers and children would yield the same conclusion as for fathers. It would be desirable to replicate this research with a data set that includes more females.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it is important to realise that describing groups of parents in terms of their trajectories does not mean that these categories are a reflection of reality. Categorizing people using the semi-parametric, group-based trajectory methodology is a way of describing the data. It is certainly no <italic>proof</italic> of the existence of clearly distinguishable groups that follow exactly the trajectory of the group they have been assigned to. Offenders are not species that exclusively belong to a certain type. The technique of trajectory modelling should be used as a heuristic tool and the results should not be perceived as the <italic>truth</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1477370811422801">Nagin, 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370811422801">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477370811422801">Nagin and Land, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477370811422801">Nagin and Tremblay, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1477370811422801">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1477370811422801">Piquero, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477370811422801">Skardhamar, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study increased our knowledge on several points. Referring back to the limitations of previous studies in intergenerational transmission identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1477370811422801">Van de Rakt et al. (2008)</xref>, the current study improved on this by using a large prospective sample including a control group with non-offending parents. Furthermore, father’s and offspring’s criminal behaviour was measured up until age 40. Additionally, this study improved on Van de Rakt et al. by investigating the relationship between parent and offspring trajectories more closely by calculating ASRs for each combination and ORs comparing the proportions of children in trajectory groups for different father trajectories. It thereby demonstrated that, although there appears to be a relationship between father and offspring trajectories, this can be attributed to the finding that non-offending fathers have non-offending children, and that fathers in conviction trajectory groups have more children in conviction trajectory groups. As mentioned previously, this has been known for decades. The current results contradict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1477370811422801">Van de Rakt et al. (2008)</xref>, who concluded that children of fathers in a more persistent trajectory group have a higher chance of belonging to a similar trajectory group.</p>
<p>As far as we know, this study and Van de Rakt et al.’s study are the only ones so far that have investigated intergenerational transmission by employing the semi-parametric, group-based trajectories methodology. Since these studies reach different conclusions, it is vital that this research is replicated, preferably with large samples including many females.</p>

<p>Assortative mating is defined as ‘the tendency for people to form unions with similar others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477370811422801">Moffitt et al., 2001</xref>: 185). People tend to affiliate with those who are similar to themselves, and antisocial people tend to marry and have children with other antisocial people. Children with two criminal parents have an increased risk of showing antisocial behaviour, experiencing a ‘double whammy’ effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477370811422801">Moffitt et al., 2001</xref>: 195; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1477370811422801">West and Farrington, 1977</xref>). They inherit an antisocial phenotype twice and grow up in a criminogenic home environment. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477370811422801">Besemer (2011)</xref> has argued, assortative mating is not a mechanism in itself, because other explanations such as genetic, social learning or risk factor mechanisms are needed to explain transmission in the first place. Assortative mating posits only that the intergenerational transmission is stronger with two criminal parents than with one criminal parent.</p>

<p>The trajectories were also estimated while correcting for time spent imprisoned if this was less than a year. The time spent imprisoned was accounted for and the corrected rate of offending was calculated with the following formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1477370811422801">Van der Geest et al., 2009</xref>):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Corrected rate of offending<italic><sub>tj</sub></italic> = off<italic><sub>tj</sub></italic> / Exposure<italic><sub>tj</sub></italic></p>
<p>Exposure<italic><sub>tj</sub></italic> = 1 − (Number of days incarcerated / 365)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Exposure<italic><sub>tj</sub></italic> = 1 − (Number of days incarcerated / 730)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It was decided, however, to use the models without this correction. Models estimated with a corrected rate of offending gave roughly the same results, which confirms previous trajectory analyses with the original men of the CSDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1477370811422801">Piquero et al., 2010</xref>). Correcting for incarceration is most common with offender samples, where everyone offended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1477370811422801">Piquero, 2008</xref>). It is less common with a (high-risk) population sample, such as the CSDD. On the one hand, it is important to correct for time spent imprisoned because people are less likely to offend while imprisoned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477370811422801">Eggleston et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1477370811422801">Piquero et al., 2001</xref>). On the other hand, people can and do still offend while they are in prison. Neither solution – correcting versus not correcting – is optimal and entirely reflects the <italic>true</italic> situation.</p>

<p>This is one way of assigning individuals to groups, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477370811422801">Goodman (2007)</xref> calls <italic>modal</italic> assignment. Goodman also demonstrates an approach (for latent class analysis) in which people with a similar response pattern are <italic>randomly</italic> assigned to a class to get the proportions of the probabilities of group membership. For example, if individuals with a certain response pattern have a probability of .8 of being in class A and .2 of being in class B, following modal assignment all these individuals would be classified as class A. Following random assignment, 80 percent of these people will be classified as A, 20 percent as B. Modal assignment minimizes incorrect classifications, while random assignment approximates the proportion of individuals in each group to be the posterior probability of group membership. Random assignment takes the uncertainty of group classification into account. When we assign people to classes in <italic>proc traj</italic> to be able to calculate with them, modal assignment is used and the group uncertainty is ignored. Currently, however, this is the only way in <italic>proc traj</italic> to assign people to classes.</p>

<p>The prevalence of convictions is higher among sons than among fathers. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1477370811422801">West and Farrington (1977)</xref> note, this can be explained by two things. First, when fathers were at their peak age of offending, the rate of convictions in the general population was lower; fewer people were convicted than when sons were at their peak age of offending. This pattern is also visible in other longitudinal studies that span a long time period such as the NSCR Transfive study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477370811422801">Bijleveld, 2005</xref>). Secondly, fathers were all family men at some point. Therefore they are less likely to have a conviction than the sample of sons, which would also include males with no family ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1477370811422801">Sampson and Laub, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1477370811422801">Theobald and Farrington, 2009</xref>).</p>

<label>11.</label>
<p>The current study also checked whether results were different for the original men versus their brothers. Analyses run separately for the original men and for their brothers lead to the same conclusion – that there is no convincing support for the hypothesis that more persistent offenders have more persistent offending children.</p>
