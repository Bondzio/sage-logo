<p>Reading Andre Béteille’s <italic>Omnibus</italic> could be a wonderful experience for a student of Sociology and Social Anthropology for a number of reasons. Not only one gets a clearer idea of history of Sociology in India of last four decades but also realises that many a propositions that now dominate sociological thinking took shape against dominant ideas of own their times. And unfailing intellectual commitment of some scholars made this possible.</p>
<p>The first book included in the omnibus <italic>Caste, Class and Power</italic> has many firsts to its credit. In an era when stalwarts like M. N. Srinivas and Louis Dumont gave primacy to caste in their analysis of Indian society, this study, on the basis of empirical evidence, argued that attention should be paid to class as well. Not only this, this study recognised multiple dimensions of inequality and also interrelations between them. Today nobody would be surprised if we talk about interrelatedness of caste and class but almost half a century ago making a statement ‘the class system has progressively detached itself from the caste structure, although there is still a high degree of correspondence between the hierarchies of caste and class’ (p. 221) was a remarkable finding. Further, on this basis of this study, Béteille underlined linkages of village with the outer world. He also delineates its dynamics with his empirical findings about sale of agricultural surplus outside the village, landowners living and having white collar jobs in the neighbouring towns and land coming into market. Another interesting finding that one finds relevant even today is about settlement pattern of the village. This study underlines that even if ‘many areas of social life are now becoming to some extent “caste-free”, the settlement pattern of the village continues to reflect the basic cleavages of the traditional structure’ (p. 3). Béteille seems to suggest here that settlement pattern experience change very late after land ownership pattern; power structure and village economy have already changed to some extent.</p>
<p>The sequence of writings included in the <italic>Omnibus</italic> also represents Béteille’s interests during last four decades. <italic>The Idea of Natural Inequality and Other Essays</italic> is a collection of his lectures mainly focused on relationship between existential and normative structures of the society. He argues that a gap exists in every society between what is considered right and what happens at the ground.</p>
<p>In the first essay of this volume ‘The Idea of Natural Inequality’, Béteille discusses notions of natural inequality and social inequality and while rejecting ‘idea of natural inequality’ as ambiguous notes that nature presents us with difference and these differences do not become inequalities unless they are assigned different values by cultural processes. Portrayal of Indian society as truly hierarchical as against modern societies leads him to negotiate these questions in ‘Homo Hierarchicus, Homo Equalis’. In this Kingsley Martin Memorial Lecture (1979), he argues that ‘no major civilization has ever fully excluded a concern for equality, and that inequality—not only the fact of inequality but the need to explain and justify it—bedevils every modern society’ (p. 4). And explains it further in another essay titled ‘Harmonic and Disharmonic Social Systems’ by adding ‘contemporary societies are permeated by the contradiction between the fact of inequality and ideal of equality and that sense constitute disharmonic systems’ (p. 5).</p>
<p>Béteille has always been expressing his discomfort with the way affirmative actions have been conceptualised and practiced in India. Presenting a critique of equality provisions in Constitution of India, he opines that strengthening of caste identity even if aimed at equalisation could prove counterproductive in the end. Béteille’s critiques have been pointing out that caste has remained an instrument of oppression so it could also be meaningfully used for identifying ‘backwards’. Béteille pursues his interest in studying contradiction between inherent inequalities in the society and declared goals of equality in the context of Indian university in his chapter on ‘The Pursuit of Equality and Indian University’. He observes that Indian universities have made some progress in terms of admitting students and recruiting faculty from diverse social background, but poorly funded state universities remain dependent on their immediate environment marked by inequalities rather than previously designated ‘elite institutions’. Further he says that ‘far from eliminating all forms of inequality, the modern university creates new inequalities, but by a process of competition in which ‘pure merit’ is believed to count as against race, caste or sex, or what is loosely described as ‘social background’ (p. 154). Further explaining his argument, in ‘Equality of Opportunity’ and ‘Equality of Opportunity and the Equal Distribution of Benefits’, Béteille finds it difficult to create full equality in the external conditions of competition. And he considers individualism still relevant for advancement of equality of opportunities between sexes. While exploring nature and implications of the tension between high value placed on individual in contemporary Indian society and persistence of collective identities, which appears paradoxical, Béteille recognises contribution of individualism in the growth of civilisation and autonomy of the individual but makes an important point that beyond this, course of pursuit of equality sometimes diverges from individualism.</p>
<p>The Part III of the <italic>Omnibus</italic>, which was earlier published as <italic>Equality and Universality</italic>, deals with social policies for greater equality and argues that neither it is possible nor even desirable to eliminate all forms of inequalities. Instead, he opines that one should learn to discriminate among different forms of inequalities and ensure that basic rights and capabilities are made universally available. Apart from providing excellent survey of the field, Béteille discusses roots and different aspects of inequalities in Chapter 1. Here also he never misses his favourite subject, the tension between ideal and the reality of social stratification. While dealing with the contrast between hierarchical and egalitarian societies, Béteille makes a brilliant point that European societies cannot be characterised egalitarian on the basis of ideals that they set for themselves but one will have to see their attitude towards their colonies in Asia, Africa and Latin America.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, in his discussion on relationship between class and status, he emphasises on considering distribution of symbolic capital along with material capital. Following two chapters, ‘Varna and Jati’ and ‘Caste in Contemporary India’, talk about decreasing influence of caste in social, intellectual and moral life. Béteille argues that erosion in moral and intellectual legitimacy is reflected in the fact that caste is often referred to in the sense of <italic>jati</italic> today than in the sense of <italic>varna</italic>. Similarly, although politics have given a new lease of life to caste, but its significance in social life has not remained the same. He points out ambivalent attitude of upper strata towards caste to substantiate his point.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, the author argues that ‘private and public are complementary categories and that they are held together by the value placed on the individual as citizen. Citizenship is both an individualizing and a universalizing concept, and the progress of democracy is intimately linked to the enlargement of citizenship’ (p. 107). Béteille has always taken an anti-reservation stand despite severe criticism from scholars having different point of view. In ‘Distributive Justice and Institutional Well-being’, while making a note that during Mandal Agitation, both sides, proponents and opponents, had based their claims on the premise of equality, Béteille comments that ‘It can hardly be said that by imposing caste quotas in government employment we are taking a significant step towards equality of results—or any kind of equality—in a country where substantial numbers of persons remain ill-fed and unlettered’ (p. 133). In large part of Chapter 7 ‘The Reproduction of Inequality’, author deals with role of family in reproduction of inequalities, although he does not deny persistence of inequalities based on caste and class but emphasises on role of family and schools especially in urban context. Although Béteille’s focus here is on families employed in modern occupational system in metros but provides insights, although limited, for the study of families located in a different milieu. Béteille comes back to his favourite subject of discussing and rejecting sharp contrast made by some scholars between ‘<italic>homo hierarchicus vs homo equalis</italic>’ in ‘The Antinomies of Equality’. He takes it further in the chapter on ‘Hierarchical and Competitive Inequality’ where he makes it clear that distinction between both kinds of inequalities is conceptual and not empirical. They coexist and reinforce each other in most of the contemporary societies including India. The last chapter on ‘Equality and Universality’ and the running argument throughout this book make a case in favour of universality. In the end Béteille quotes Rawls to further clarify his position, ‘although the bias of the policy should be towards equality, an increase of inequality overall is justified if it benefits the most disadvantaged members of society’ (p. 221).</p>
<p>Béteille was perhaps one of the first sociologists who applied Weberian categories and method to conduct a village study in India. Till then these studies were largely dominated by functionalists under the leadership of M. N. Srinivas. He used class along with caste, although with a clear emphasis on caste, in his analysis but at the same time he maintained a distance with Marx. In his own words, he says, ‘They were also unhappy with my treatment of Marx for they believed, not without reason, that I favoured Max Weber over Karl Marx in the analysis of social stratification. I was not willing to dismiss Marx as a mere ideologue, as many academic sociologists were; but I was not prepared to adhere to the Marxist canon in my analysis of society’ (p. xiv).</p>
<p>The best thing that many Indian sociologists find in him was his critique of Dumont who was trying to present a contrast between hierarchical Indian society and egalitarian Western societies. But at the same time several of them seem to disagree with him on his position on affirmative actions in India. All in all, one can agree or disagree with Béteille but one cannot afford not to read this <italic>Omnibus</italic>.</p>
