<abstract>
<p>This study examined the impact of immigrant job applicants’ private domain acculturation preferences on managers’ evaluations of person-organization (P-O) fit and hiring decisions. We employed an experimental design and presented Norwegian managers (<italic>N</italic> = 74) with video-clips of three job applicants. One of the applicants’ (target) ethnicity (Norwegian vs. Turkish) and private domain acculturation preferences (separated, assimilated, and integrated) were manipulated across four experimental conditions. Among the three applicants, the target applicant was presented as the best qualified. The results showed that the separated target was perceived as less similar to existing organizational members and the organization (i.e., lower supplementary P-O fit) than the three other targets, and as less valuable in terms of being different (i.e., lower complementary P-O fit) than the assimilated and the integrated targets. The separated target was rated significantly lower on hirability than the native and integrated targets. Despite the different hiring ratings, all targets received equal ratings on person-job (P-J) fit. The findings imply that managers placed a stronger emphasis on P-O fit than formal work competence when evaluating the separated target. Because private domain acculturation preferences can be deemed irrelevant for immigrant applicants’ job performance, our results suggest a biased employment decision against the immigrant applicant expressing private domain cultural maintenance preferences.</p>

<p>Across all OECD countries, immigrants are more likely than native-born individuals to hold jobs for which they are over-qualified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022022111430256">OECD, 2007</xref>). Immigrants to Western Europe are also more likely to be unemployed than members of the majority populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022022111430256">Van Tubergen, 2006</xref>). Job interviews are considered to be one of the primary obstacles for skilled immigrants’ access to the labor market (Coates &amp; Carr, 2005). Several recent studies have shown evidence of unfavorable employment decisions based on subtle forms of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022022111430256">Regmi, Naidoo, &amp; Regmi, 2009</xref>) and negative stereotypic attitudes held against immigrant job applicants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022111430256">Agerström &amp; Rooth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111430256">Cotton, O’Neill, &amp; Griffin, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022111430256">de Meier, Born, Zielst, and van der Molen (2007)</xref> argue that interviewers’ unfamiliarity with foreign-born applicants’ culture and traditions, as well as lack of experience with interviewing foreign-born applicants, increase the risk of stereotypic activation and biased employment decisions. They found that even highly experienced recruiters were less secure of their own judgments, used more sources of information, and relied on a larger number of irrelevant cues when evaluating ethnic minority applicants compared to ethnic majority applicants.</p>
<p>The “fit” perspective suggests that recruiters’ perceptions of compatibility (e.g., values, personality, goals) between applicants and jobs and organizations predict their hiring recommendations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111430256">Cable &amp; Judge, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111430256">Kristof-Brown, 2000</xref>). Perceived P-O fit is regarded as the degree to which interviewers perceive that the applicant fits the organization’s values and goals, as well as the personalities of the organization’s members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111430256">Cable &amp; Judge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111430256">Kristof-Brown, 2000</xref>). Thus, P-O fit applies to the general organizational culture, and not necessarily to the actual job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022022111430256">Sekiguchi, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Organizational cultures are nested within national cultures, implying that native-born job applicants have a higher chance of internalizing the values and norms dominant on both cultural levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022111430256">Brodbeck, Hanges, Dickson, Gupta, &amp; Dorfman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022022111430256">Erez &amp; Gati, 2004</xref>). Recent studies have concluded that foreign-born candidates adopting an identity consistent with the majority culture have significantly higher employment probabilities than foreign-born candidates who identify with their ethnic background or culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111430256">Battu &amp; Zenou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022111430256">Constant &amp; Zimmerman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022111430256">Nekby &amp; Rödin, 2010</xref>). Several researchers relate such findings to majority members’ small support for cultural maintenance among ethnic minority members and strong support for immigrants to adjust to the majority culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022111430256">Arends-Tôth &amp; van de Vijver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022111430256">Horenczyk, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022022111430256">Van Oudenhoven, Prins, &amp; Buunk, 1998</xref>). Against this backdrop there is reason to believe that managers focus on adjustment to the majority culture when evaluating the extent to which immigrant job applicants fit their organizations.</p>
<p>To date, few studies have addressed the impact of organizational fit on employment probability for foreign-born job applicants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111430256">Battu &amp; Zenou, 2010</xref>). Consequently, the focus of the present study is on immigrant acculturation strategies as well as managers’ evaluations of applicant fit. We propose that foreign-born applicants expressing minority culture maintenance preferences will trigger hiring managers’ skepticism concerning the applicants’ fit with their organization.</p>

<title>Immigrants’ Cultural Identity and Acculturation Strategies</title>
<p>Traditionally, studies on immigrants’ position in the labor market have had a tendency to use ethnic group membership as a catch-all measure for cultural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111430256">Battu &amp; Zenou, 2010</xref>). Recent studies have incorporated a more nuanced perspective and focus on the cultural identity adopted by immigrants as a result of <italic>acculturation</italic> processes. Acculturation is described as individual changes in behaviors, attitudes, values, and customs due to long-term intercultural contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022111430256">Berry, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022111430256">Nekby &amp; Rödin, 2010</xref>). Berry et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022111430256">Berry, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022111430256">Berry, Phinney, Sam, &amp; Vedder, 2006</xref>) have suggested that acculturation incorporates two underlying fundamental attitudes: the extent to which immigrants favor maintaining key aspects of their ethnic culture (cultural maintenance) and the extent to which immigrants wish to have contact with and participate in the majority culture (cultural adaptation). This yields four types of acculturation strategies: <italic>Integration</italic> refers to maintaining key features of one’s original culture and at the same time adopting key features of the majority society. <italic>Assimilation</italic> refers to letting go of one’s original culture and adapting to the majority culture. <italic>Separation</italic> refers to a preference for one’s original culture and a rejection of the culture of the majority, while <italic>marginalization</italic> refers to a rejection of both one’s culture of origin and the culture of the majority.</p>
<p>Immigrants tend to use different acculturation strategies depending on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111430256">Battu &amp; Zenou, 2010</xref>). In a study among Bangladeshi immigrants in England, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022111430256">Sen (2000)</xref> found that combined identification with both the minority and the majority group was not considered problematic for the immigrants themselves, suggesting that identities can be multiple. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022111430256">Arends-Tôth and van de Vijver (2003)</xref> found that immigrants viewed integration as the preferred mode of acculturation in their public domain (e.g., work context), but that separation was preferred in the private domain (e.g., spare time). From the perspective of majority members, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022022111430256">Schalk-Soekar, Breugelmans, and van de Vijver (2008)</xref> found that majority members believed it was impossible for immigrants to combine minority culture maintenance and adjustment to the majority society, implying that maintaining one culture automatically means letting go of the other.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022022111430256">Schalk-Soekar and van de Vijver (2008)</xref>, members of the mainstream culture make no distinction between their public and private domains. Consequently, majority members are likely to expect a similar homogeneous domain-independent preference for immigrants. A recent experimental study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111430256">Horverak, Sandal, Pallesen, and Timmerman (2011)</xref> supports this suggestion. That study compared managers’ evaluations of an immigrant job applicant expressing mixed acculturation strategies: integration at work (indicated by favorable recommendations from previous employers) and separation in more private domains (indicated by a home-country clothing style and preferring friends from the culture of origin), with a native applicant and an immigrant applicant expressing integration in both work and private contexts. The immigrant expressing mixed acculturation strategies had a lower employment probability compared to the two other applicants. These findings nuance the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111430256">Battu and Zenou (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022111430256">Constant and Zimmerman (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022111430256">Nekby and Rödin (2010)</xref>, who concluded that given a high attachment to the majority culture, identification to the ethnic minority group was unimportant for employment outcomes. Notably, in the three latter studies, the conclusions were primarily based on follow-up surveys using immigrant background data matched with register data on education and employment. It was not investigated how majority culture managers responded to applicants’ expressions of acculturation strategy during the employment evaluation process. To further examine the role of acculturation in immigrants’ labor marked outcomes, the present study considers how managers’ evaluations of applicant fit and employment recommendations are influenced by immigrants’ cultural maintenance preferences in the private domain.</p>

<sec id="section2-0022022111430256">
<title>Person-Organization Fit</title>
<p>Research on P-O fit has traditionally focused on <italic>supplementary fit</italic>, defined as the extent to which applicants are perceived as similar to existing organizational members and as sharing the organization’s values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022111430256">Cable &amp; Edwards, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022022111430256">Piasentin &amp; Chapman, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022022111430256">2007</xref>). This means that the applicant possesses characteristics similar to those already widely possessed in the existing workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022111430256">Cable &amp; Edwards, 2004</xref>). In the extant research, values have been the most common basis for supplementary fit assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111430256">Kristof, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022022111430256">Piasentin &amp; Chapman, 2006</xref>). The similarity-attraction paradigm introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022111430256">Byrne (1971)</xref> suggests that interviewers are more attracted to similar individuals and therefore assess similar applicants as more qualified for the job and a better match for the organization than dissimilar applicants. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022111430256">Ferris and Judge (1991)</xref> suggested that interviewers may see themselves as good standards for evaluating P-O fit because they are successful organizational employees. Consequently, applicant dissimilarity to the interviewer may lower evaluations of fit with the organization.</p>
<p>Another form of P-O fit is <italic>complementary fit</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022022111430256">Muchinsky &amp; Monahan, 1987</xref>), which occurs when applicants possess unique characteristics that are perceived as different from other employees’ characteristics, yet valuable to the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022022111430256">Piasentin &amp; Chapman, 2007</xref>). Empirical investigations of P-O fit have given this type of fit minimal attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022022111430256">Piasentin and Chapman, 2007</xref>), and to our knowledge, no study has investigated managers’ evaluations of immigrant job applicants’ complementary P-O fit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022022111430256">Piasentin and Chapman (2006)</xref> suggest that while values may be critical for assessing supplementary P-O fit, personality characteristics or work-related skills and abilities may be important for assessing complementary P-O fit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022111430256">Cable and Edwards (2004)</xref> found that complementary fit accounted for unique variance in work outcomes and thus provided a more complete assessment of P-O fit. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022022111430256">Piasentin and Chapman (2007)</xref> found that employees’ perceived complementarity with their organization contributed to overall judgments of fit incrementally to perceptions of similarity (i.e., supplementary P-O fit).</p>
<p>In the work environment, ethnic diversity gives rise to different life experiences, knowledge, and insights, which in turn may provide more and better alternatives to problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022111430256">McLeod &amp; Lobel, 1992</xref>), enhance creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111430256">Ling, 1990</xref>), thus enhancing accomplishment of organizational goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022111430256">Ely &amp; Thomas, 2001</xref>). Ethnic diversity among employees may also serve as a competitive advantage in rapidly changing and increasingly international markets. Still, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022022111430256">Piasentin and Chapman (2007)</xref> have pointed out that only a small proportion of individuals recognize the value of “fitting in by being different.”</p>

<sec id="section3-0022022111430256">
<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>Whereas the topics of acculturation psychology and applicant fit have received extensive attention, there is a lack of studies investigating how immigrants’ acculturation strategies affect managers’ evaluations of applicant fit and hirability. In our study, we draw a clear distinction between immigrants’ acculturation preferences in their public and private domains. Specifically, we investigate whether information regarding acculturation preferences in the private sphere only impact managers’ fit evaluations and hiring decisions. A negative impact of private domain acculturation preferences would indicate an employment decision bias.</p>
<p>An experimental design was used in which Norwegian managers were presented with video clips of three job applicants. Whereas the presentation of two applicants was similar for all managers, we manipulated the ethnicity (Norwegian vs. Turkish immigrant) and the private domain acculturation strategy (separated, assimilated, and integrated for the Turkish immigrant) of the third applicant. The third applicant will be referred to as the native, the separated, the assimilated, and the integrated target. Among the three applicants, the target applicant was presented as the most socially competent, and as the best professionally qualified candidate. Based on research presented above, we expect that managers respond negatively to a strong desire for private sphere cultural maintenance (separated target). Specifically, we hypothesize that the separated target’s expression of cultural maintenance preferences results in lower ratings of supplementary P-O fit because this candidate is likely to be perceived as the most dissimilar to existing employees in the workplace.</p>
<p>Regarding complementary P-O fit, we expect the highest complementary P-O fit ratings for the integrated and the separated targets. The logic behind this reasoning is that these targets’ maintenance of their background culture provides access to the benefits of a diverse working environment. We expect the lowest complementary P-O fit ratings for the native and the assimilated targets since these targets are likely to be seen as most similar to the existing organizational members (most of whom are likely to be ethnic Norwegian) and thus less likely to complement the organization in terms of being different.</p>
<p>Findings from the above-mentioned acculturation and social psychology research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022111430256">Arends-Tôth &amp; van de Vijver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022111430256">Byrne, 1971</xref>) suggest that the desire for similarity may be stronger than the recognition of applicants’ ability to complement the organization with new perspectives in recruitment processes. Consequently, we expected lower hirability ratings, and a lower employment probability for the separated target than for the three other target candidates. The following specific hypotheses were investigated:</p>
<list id="list1-0022022111430256" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The separated target candidate is rated as exhibiting less supplementary P-O fit than the three other target candidates.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The integrated and the separated target candidates are rated higher on complementary P-O fit than the assimilated and native target candidates.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The separated target candidate is rated as less hirable and is less often ranked as the preferred candidate for the job than the three other target candidates.</p></list-item></list>

<sec id="section5-0022022111430256">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Four different strategies were employed to invite participants to take part in the study: (1) Managers from 10 companies were invited via a contact person in their organization, (2) invitations were distributed via two organizations that run leader networks, (3) managers attending leadership training courses and lectures for managers were invited, and (4) managers were recruited by an ad in an online magazine for managers. For the managers in the first two groups, a reminder to participate in the study was distributed 1 week after the original invitation. It was not possible to estimate the response rate via the mailing list. The response rate from the participating organizations ranged from 13.6% to 60.0%, with an overall response rate of 21.0%. No monetary or material reward was given. In the electronic setup, it was not possible for respondents to skip questions. Hence, we had no missing data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022022111430256">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample (<italic>N</italic> = 74) consisted of 49 men and 25 women whose age ranged from 29 to 67 years (<italic>M</italic> = 46.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.30). All but two of the respondents were Norwegian born. Because the two non-Norwegians were of Western origin and had lived in Norway for a long period of time, they were retained in the sample. The majority of the participants held a leadership position at the time of the data collection (95.9%). With respect to leadership level, 33.3% were chief executive officers/senior executives, 16.7% were the head of a division, 31.9% were leaders at the department/unit level, and 17.7% held other types of leadership positions. The average number of years in a leader position was 13.24 (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.99). Among the respondents, 78.7% worked in the private sector and 21.3% worked in the public sector. Only three respondents had no previous experience with job interviews. On average, the participants had interviewed 32.92 applicants (<italic>SD</italic> = 28.90). The distribution of the participants’ age and sex by the experimental conditions were the following: Norwegian target: age (<italic>M</italic> = 44.80, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.87), sex (male, <italic>n</italic> = 12, female, <italic>n</italic> = 8); assimilated target: age (<italic>M</italic> = 45.21, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.32), sex (male, <italic>n</italic> = 11, female, <italic>n</italic> = 3); separated target: age (<italic>M</italic> = 47.41, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.53), sex (male, <italic>n</italic> = 13, female, <italic>n</italic> = 4); and integrated target: age (<italic>M</italic> = 49.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.27), sex (male, <italic>n</italic> = 13, female, <italic>n</italic> = 10).</p>
<p>The immigrant applicant was of Turkish origin. Turks represent one of the largest immigrant groups in Norway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022111430256">Statistics Norway, 2011</xref>) and in several other European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022022111430256">Vasileva, 2009</xref>). Turks are often seen as the prototypical immigrant group, with relatively low social status across many West-European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022111430256">Arends-Tôth &amp; van de Vijver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022111430256">Hagendoorn &amp; Hraba, 1989</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022022111430256">Kaya and Kentel (2005)</xref> claim that Turkish immigrants are especially prone to experiencing stereotypic bias.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022022111430256">
<title>Experimental Design and Procedure</title>
<p>The experiment was set up online. The managers were asked to answer several background questions and were next randomized into one of the four experimental conditions. All respondents were asked to imagine that the human resource department in their organization was hiring a new advisor. A job description for the position was then presented, listing the formal requirements for the position and the key tasks to be performed. Next, the managers were asked to watch video clips of structured interviews with three male job candidates (actors). The second candidate was the target candidate. The experimental conditions were the following: a Norwegian target candidate (<italic>n</italic> = 20), an immigrant target candidate with an integrated acculturation strategy (<italic>n</italic> = 23), an immigrant target candidate with an assimilated acculturation strategy (<italic>n</italic> = 14), and an immigrant target candidate with a separated acculturation strategy (<italic>n</italic> = 17).</p>
<p>When the target was presented as an immigrant, he was described as exhibiting strong ties to the majority culture in the public domain, and with varying degrees of ethnic cultural maintenance preferences in the private domain. The manipulations concerned the extent to which he expressed interest in socializing with ethnic majority members and the extent to which he pursued traditions and norms from his culture of origin in his spare time. Specifically, the assimilated target expressed adaptation to the majority culture’s way of living. The integrated target expressed interest in participating in the majority society and culture and at the same time emphasized the importance of engaging in Turkish social networks and traditions. The separated target solely expressed a need for Turkish cultural maintenance. The core elements used to illustrate the acculturation strategies were adopted from vignettes presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022022111430256">Van Oudenhoven et al. (1998)</xref>. In the video clips, the immigrant target presented himself as having lived in Norway for 20 years. He spoke fluent Norwegian, but with an accent. The video clips of the two non-target candidates were kept constant across all conditions.</p>
<p>The managers were asked to evaluate each candidate on P-O fit measures and hirability before viewing the next candidate. After having watched and evaluated all three candidates, they were asked to indicate which of the candidates they would prefer to hire. After they ranked the candidates, the respondents were asked to indicate the degree to which the films were perceived as realistic. No time restrictions were given. All manuscripts were of equal length (varied within 15 words), and the film clips lasted for approximately 3 minutes. The first author acted as the interviewer by asking the questions and was not visible in the videos.</p>
<p>The job description outlined primary work tasks such as personnel and organizational development, recruitment, and providing guidance in situations related to labor legislation and difficult personnel cases. The requirements for the position were college or university education (preferably with a specialization in HR), previous experience within the field, knowledge of labor legislation, good cooperation and communication skills, and ability to work in a structured and independent manner. All the candidates fulfilled the requirements to some degree. The target candidate had the highest level of education, had the most relevant educational background, and was more experienced within the HR field than the non-targets.</p>

<p>The previous analyses have shown that the managers’ P-O fit evaluations and hiring ratings differ when they are presented with targets holding different acculturation strategies. To investigate if the managers’ hirability ratings are influenced by their P-O fit evaluations, we performed a follow-up one-way between-groups analysis of covariance. The independent variable was acculturation strategy, and the dependent variable was hirability. Supplementary and complementary P-O fit were used as covariates.

<p>Our third hypothesis also proposed that the separated target candidate would be less often ranked as the preferred candidate for the job compared to the other target candidates.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An experimental design was employed to investigate the impact of immigrant job candidates’ private domain acculturation preferences on hiring managers’ P-O fit evaluations and hiring decisions. Supporting our first hypothesis, the immigrant candidate expressing separation preferences in his private domain was evaluated as having the lowest supplementary P-O fit compared to the three other target candidates. This finding suggests that the managers perceived this target as being less similar to existing employees in the workplace and as to a lesser degree sharing the organization’s values.</p>
<p>Our second hypothesis stated that the separated and the integrated targets were rated higher than the assimilated and the native targets on complementary P-O fit. Contrary to our expectations, a different pattern emerged: Both the integrated and the assimilated targets received higher ratings on complementary P-O fit than the native target, indicating an appreciation of the value of being different for these two targets relative to the native target. The separated target was not rated as exhibiting more complementary P-O fit than neither the assimilated nor the native targets. This indicates that candidates who express cultural maintenance preferences in the private domain (i.e., separation) are not valued for being different in a sense that could benefit the organization. Our main finding regarding complementary P-O fit is that only immigrant candidates who express adaptation to the host culture, both at work and in their private domain (i.e., assimilated and integrated), seem to be valued for being different relative to native candidates. These findings are in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022022111430256">Schalk-Soekar et al.’s (2008)</xref> description of mainstreamers’ disbelief in immigrants’ ability to combine acculturation preferences according to the context in which they engage.</p>
<p>The third hypothesis stated that the separated target was rated lowest on hirability and had a lower hiring probability than the three other target candidates. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the separated target received lower hirability ratings than the native and the integrated target. Contrary to our hypothesis, no differences in hirability ratings were found between the separated and the assimilated targets, although an inspection of the mean scores revealed a tendency of higher hirability ratings for the assimilated over the separated target. Similarly, we found that the separated target was least often ranked as the best candidate compared to the three other target candidates. Although this difference was not significant, the tendency of a lowered employment probability is consistent with the findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111430256">Horverak et al.’s (2011)</xref> study.</p>
<p>Notably, the results of our study contradicts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111430256">Battu and Zenou (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022111430256">Constant and Zimmerman (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022111430256">Nekby and Rödin’s (2010)</xref> conclusions that showing attachment to ones’ ethnic culture is not detrimental for employment outcomes as long as immigrants also show an interest in having a strong attachment to majority culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111430256">Battu and Zenou (2010)</xref> proposed that only immigrants expressing extreme identities (in both public and private domains) experienced employment penalties. In the current experiment, the separated target was presented as being well integrated in the majority public domain based on his former education and work experience within the majority work context. Our findings suggest that immigrants expressing strong ethnic identities lived out in their private domain only also experience employment penalties. As such, the desire for similarity outweighs the desire for complementing the organization with new perspectives. This tendency may result in a homogeneous workforce and thus works against organizational policies toward promoting a diverse working environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022111430256">Harcourt, Lam, Harcourt, &amp; Flynn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022111430256">Richard, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022022111430256">Segrest Purkiss, Perrewé, Gillespie, Mayes, and Ferris (2006)</xref> found that the combination of an ethnic minority name and an accent triggered more negative interviewer reactions than an ethnic minority name or an accent alone. Similarly, our results showed that the pairing of ethnicity and a specific private domain acculturation strategy (separation) triggered a more skeptical view towards the candidate. We found that 41.2% of managers presented with the separated target preferred a less qualified (native nontarget) candidate. The respective numbers for managers presented with the assimilated and integrated targets were 14.3 % and 13.0%. This finding implies that acculturation strategy may be more important for immigrants’ employment probabilities than ethnicity per se.</p>
<sec id="section23-0022022111430256">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>The respondents in our study were managers, responsible for personnel and employment decisions in their respective organizations; thus, we had a representative sample in the sense that the respondents were actual decision makers. By presenting the managers with videos of the job applicants, we provided them with a parallel audio-visual impression of the candidate. The job announcement and all manuscripts were based on actual job requirements and job descriptions. In addition, we introduced the applicants as a future colleague and close collaborator with the manager. This approach was chosen to increase the realism of the experimental interview setting, and the managers in our study rated the videos as fairly realistic.</p>
<p>However, it is possible that the managers recognized the underlying aim of investigating employment evaluations of foreign-born job applicants, which in turn might have resulted in social desirable responses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022111430256">Barron, Hebl, and King (2011)</xref> suggest that hiring managers are sensitive to cues regarding appropriate behavior and are inclined to reduce their observably discriminatory behavior. Thus, discrimination against separated immigrant applicants may be even stronger in real life settings than what we observed. Similarly, studies of employment decisions in field settings may also reveal unfavorable employment outcomes for assimilated and integrated immigrant applicants even though this was not observed in our experimental study.</p>
<p>The response rate and the sample size in our study was rather low; hence, the generalizability of our results can be questioned. Nonetheless, the obtained response rate is within the norm for surveys of organizational representatives such as managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022111430256">Baruch &amp; Holtom, 2008</xref>). Most managers experience time pressure and this is probably one reason for the relative low response rate. As for the current study, the response rate obtained from the leadership network list may still be an underestimate as lack of response may be due to sick leave, holiday, or obsolete addresses. Another concern related to generalizability of our findings applies to the cultural contrasts, which in the present study included Turkish and Norwegian applicants only. Thus, future studies should include other cultural contrasts in order to corroborate our findings and conclusions.</p>

<sec id="section24-0022022111430256">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>In accordance with several previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022111430256">de Meier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111430256">Horverak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022022111430256">Segrest Purkiss et al., 2006</xref>), our results indicate that interviewers allow irrelevant factors to affect judgments and employment decisions about ethnic minority job applicants. Our study points at the relevance of investigating the role of acculturation on immigrants’ labor market outcomes as a domain-specific concept. For example, acculturation as expressed in the work situation may have relevance for work performance because a worker who maintains specific communication patterns from his culture of origin may interact less efficiently with customers or colleagues. For HR practitioners, it is important to emphasize the use of stringent evaluation criteria based on job analysis to give less room for subjectivity, especially when assessing immigrant job applicants’ organizational suitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022111430256">Agerström &amp; Rooth, 2008</xref>). Interviewer training programs should raise awareness of sources of employment decision bias, such as the effect of acculturation demonstrated in the present study. This may strengthen interviewers’ ability to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant candidate information, increase the accuracy of P-O fit assessments, and thus facilitate the implementation of fair recruitment strategies and practices.</p>
<p>Very few studies have so far considered how judgments of P-O fit affect hiring of immigrants; thus, the present study provides a valuable contribution to the research literature. One avenue for future research would be to investigate the accuracy of P-O fit assessment during job interviews. For example, will hiring managers tend to underestimate immigrant applicants’ “objective” supplementary P-O fit and overestimate native candidates’ complementary P-O fit?</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results of the current study illustrates that the combined use of supplementary and complementary P-O fit measures provides important nuances to the understanding of managers’ interview evaluations of immigrant candidates. The results of this study extend previous research findings by illustrating that private domain acculturation preferences impact on P-O fit evaluations and employment outcomes for foreign-born candidates.</p>
