<abstract>
<p>Much is already known about how theory groups—schools of thought centered on the influential works of a small number of scholars—emerge. Yet, little is known about how prolonged periods of conflict between theory groups affects the theory-group life cycle. The author presents a review of critiques and exchanges published by scholars in the organization-environment subfield, and shows that these can be used to identify “emergence,” “conflict,” and “postconflict” periods. Poisson and negative binomial regression analyses of 656 publications show that the frequency of intertheory-group citations decreased following the conflict period (1985-1994). Linear regression models show that, when intertheory-group citations appeared following the conflict period, they were increasingly likely to be of older rather than newer publications. The results suggest that periods of heightened conflict, because of their effect on intertheory-group citations, may impact future theory development.</p>

<body>
<p>In the now classic model of scientific change, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1056492611403485">Kuhn (1962)</xref> argued that the accumulation of discrepant empirical results creates the potential for a shift in the underlying epistemological structure (i.e., triggers a scientific revolution at the metatheoretical level; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1056492611403485">Cole, 1992</xref>). Building on this idea, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611403485">Mullins and Mullins (1973)</xref> proposed that groups of theories (aka schools of thought) within an academic field are regularly replaced by new theory groups through a similar mechanism. The regular ascension of new theory groups is akin to a disciplinary revolution at the theory level.</p>
<p>However, the interdisciplinary field known as organization studies has long existed in a state of theory-group multiplicity. The theory groups most influential today—New Institutional Sociology (NIS), Organizational Ecology (OE), Resource Dependency Theory (RD), and Transaction Cost Economics (TCE)—are largely the same as in the early 1980s. Although theory proliferation has been a topic of interest in organization studies over this entire period, new theory groups do not seem to have emerged to replace the old. Furthermore, no single theory group has clearly risen to preeminence and the existing theory groups seem locked in with each other. The late 1980s were commonly characterized as a time of “paradigm war” in organization studies. (It should be noted that the label “paradigm war” is somewhat of a misnomer as contestation between theory groups is perhaps the more accurate description because conflicts such as this one are not Kuhnian struggles between metatheories.) This period of direct theory-group contestation developed into a prolonged debate over theory incommensurability in the middle to late 1990s. The major theory groups, although at times somewhat distanced from the most-heated parts of these debates, have nonetheless played a significant role in it.</p>
<p>Ten years have now passed since the height of this incommensurability debate. In this time, has intertheory-group interaction become less confrontational? Is there now movement, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611403485">Mullins and Mullins’ (1973)</xref> model of theory-group development suggests, back toward synthesis, the transcendence of existing theory groups, and the development of new ones? What effects, if any, did the prolonged period of theory-group conflict have?</p>
<sec id="section1-1056492611403485">
<title>The Emergence of Theory Groups and the Role of Paradigm Wars</title>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611403485">Mullins and Mullins’ (1973)</xref> model, the development of each new theory group is a four-stage process. In the first stage (the normal stage), the intellectual innovation is produced and the innovative scholar attracts colleagues and graduate students at their home institution. In the second stage (the network stage), these graduate students and faculty affiliates move on to other institutions and begin to spread the theory. In the third stage (the cluster stage), colonization of other research centers begins in earnest, scholars with no direct tie to the innovator-scholar begin to work on the line of theory, and the theory group divides into a core of 7 to 25 individuals and a periphery.</p>
<p>The network building that occurs in Stages 2 and 3 is of special importance, as scholars have repeatedly noted how perceptions of scientific validity are predicated on one’s success in building a network of adherents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056492611403485">Clark &amp; Murdoch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1056492611403485">Latour, 1987</xref>). In the fourth and final stage of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611403485">Mullins and Mullins’ (1973)</xref> model (the specialty stage), the innovator may move on to pursue other lines of research, but research remains active within the theory group. At this mature stage, the ideas developed by each theory group become a part of the background for the next round of theory innovation. Over time, as new theory groups emerge, older theory groups become less and less distinct and important. Mullins and Mullins’ model of disciplinary change is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1056492611403485">Fuchs (1993)</xref>, who argued that constant specialization and fragmentation are the hallmarks of any discipline and the primary drivers of change.</p>
<p>The ideas of constant theory generation and periodic theory-group turnover together suggest that other factors are needed to explain which theories will become central to a new theory group and which will not. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1056492611403485">McKinley, Mone, and Moon (1999)</xref> suggested that three theory attributes play a particularly important role. Scholars of theories that make surprising predictions, exhibit continuity with existing works, and are of sufficient scope to allow others to integrate themselves are more likely to form a viable theory group. Building on this work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1056492611403485">Ofori-Dankwa and Julian (2005)</xref> suggested that the innovator’s academic affiliation, the status of the publication outlet(s), and the innovator’s social-network status all play a role in making innovative ideas visible. This increased visibility, in turn, facilitates the development of a new theory group.</p>
<sec id="section2-1056492611403485">
<title>The Unknown Role of Theory-Group Conflict</title>
<p>However, absent from these models of theory-group formation is the possibility of long-term theory-group institutionalization (which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1056492611403485">Mullins, 1983</xref>, only notes briefly), theory proliferation that is decoupled with theory-group formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1056492611403485">McKinley, 2010</xref>), and periods of heightened conflict between theory groups. In particular, the role of the paradigm war in organization studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056492611403485">Aldrich, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056492611403485">Donaldson, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056492611403485">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1056492611403485">Gioia &amp; Pitre, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1056492611403485">Hassard, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1056492611403485">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1056492611403485">Jackson &amp; Carter, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1056492611403485">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1056492611403485">Parker &amp; McHugh, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1056492611403485">Willmott, 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1056492611403485">1993b</xref>) has an unknown relationship to the process of theory-group-driven disciplinary change. It bears repeating that the label “paradigm war” is somewhat of a misnomer here as the conflict never reached the level of metatheory.</p>
<p>The major theory groups in the organization-environment subfield of organizational studies have repeatedly clashed with one another without any one theory group being displaced from mainstream organizational thinking. This conflict has only slowly been waning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492611403485">Hardy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1056492611403485">Schwarz, Clegg, Cummings, Donaldson, &amp; Miner, 2007</xref>) and the highly visible, open exchanges between adherents to different theory groups were replaced by a debate over theory-group “incommensurability” in the middle to late 1990s.</p>
<p>Without specifically commenting on the role of theory-group conflict, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492611403485">Hassard and Kelemen (2002)</xref> argued that five responses occur in response to sustained theory multiplicity: nonconsumption (i.e., choosing to ignore the multiplicity), integrationism, protectionism, pluralism, and postmodernism (i.e., seeing the theory-group or paradigm concepts as the central problem). A variant of the pluralist type is the incommensurability thesis that originated in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611403485">Burrell and Morgan (1979)</xref>. The idea of incommensurability became a key facet of the paradigm war (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1056492611403485">Jackson &amp; Carter, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1056492611403485">1993</xref>), although this was resisted by others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1056492611403485">Weaver &amp; Gioia, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1056492611403485">Willmott, 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1056492611403485">1993b</xref>) who called for the cessation of the theory-group mentality altogether (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1056492611403485">Scherer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1056492611403485">Scherer &amp; Steinmann, 1999</xref>, for comprehensive reviews of the multiple theory-group problem and incommensurability up to the mid-1990s).</p>
<p>At the height of the incommensurability debate, the May 1998 issue of <italic>Organization</italic> sought to bring in multiple perspectives on the issue. Although virtually all of the authors argued that the problem of paradigm incommensurability needed to be overcome (with the notable exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492611403485">Czarniawska, 1998</xref>, who argued that conflicting views were valuable in and of themselves), there was no consensus on whether terminology standardization and empirical adjudication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1056492611403485">McKinley &amp; Mone, 1998</xref>), epistemological shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1056492611403485">Gergen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1056492611403485">Kaghan &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1056492611403485">Scherer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1056492611403485">Spender, 1998</xref>), or metatheory efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492611403485">Bouchikhi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492611403485">Donaldson, 1998</xref>) were the most promising way of dealing with the issue.</p>
<p>Many of these themes continued to appear in more recent articles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1056492611403485">Knights (2008)</xref> continued the argument that conflicting theories are good, claiming that some degree of distance between academics and managers is actually valued by practitioners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1056492611403485">McKinley (2007)</xref> continued to argue that terminological and measurement standardization are the way forward. The praxis-based epistemological shift proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1056492611403485">Pfeffer (1993)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1056492611403485">Scherer and Steinmann (1999)</xref> continued to be vigorously debated as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1056492611403485">Schwarz et al. (2007)</xref> continued to note that organization studies needs a stronger connection to real-world practices. Others argued that a more applied approach to organizations research may reduce its generalizability because research would only be tailored to very particular circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1056492611403485">Kelemen &amp; Bansal, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1056492611403485">Tadajewski (2009)</xref> provided an updated review of the larger incommensurability debate and argued that the state of incommensurability remains despite continuing efforts to deal with the issue.</p>
<p>What remains missing is the connection between theory-group conflict—particularly sustained examples such as those demonstrated in the incommensurability debate—and long-term disciplinary change. Is the present situation in organization studies stable? Can theory-group multiplicity persist indefinitely? Or, is the synthesis/transcendence of existing theory groups inevitable?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1056492611403485">
<title>Theory Multiplicity: The Question of Long-term Stability</title>
<p>For the minority of organizational scholars who see theory-group multiplicity as an asset rather than a liability (see again <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492611403485">Czarniawska, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1056492611403485">Knights, 2008</xref>), theory-group multiplicity is not problematic and the question of long-term stability is not addressed. However, others make the argument that the nature of incommensurability itself grants some degree of stability. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1056492611403485">Espeland and Stevens (1998)</xref>, “defining something as incommensurate is a special form of valuing” (p. 326). They further argued that the incommensurability position will tend to be more vigorously defended if the categories in question (theory groups in this case) are central to roles and identities. Maintaining the position that categories, such as theory groups, are incommensurable is a form of boundary work and one that is frequently sustained despite the great deal of effort often required to do so.</p>
<p>The motivation required to maintain the incommensurability position, in the organization-studies case, seems to be amply present. For many scholars, academic careers have been intricately tied to one particular school of thought. Furthermore, attempts to define competing theory groups or categories as commensurable can be readily viewed from a power perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492611403485">Czarniawska, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1056492611403485">Espeland &amp; Stevens, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1056492611403485">Scherer &amp; Steinmann, 1999</xref>). According to this logic, a declaration of <italic>commensurability</italic> is akin to an exercise of power because one is declaring to know the means of adjudication. Declaring something <italic>incommensurate</italic>, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1056492611403485">Espeland and Stevens (1998)</xref>, is a way of affirming the individual value of one or more categories.</p>
<p>However, there are others who view theory-group multiplicity as unstable in the long run. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611403485">Mullins and Mullins’ (1973)</xref> model of theory groups itself suggested that synthesis is a natural part of the theory-group process. Each new theory that is to become the core of a new theory group begins as a synthesis of disparate ideas from existing theory groups. As each theory group reaches maturation, its work becomes part of the theory backdrop for the next generation of theory-group development. Others argued that pluralism and incommensurability, wherein the mode for deciding between alternatives is itself contested, is an unstable state because practitioners require unambiguous answers to specific problems from science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1056492611403485">McKinley &amp; Mone, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1056492611403485">Scherer &amp; Steinmann, 1999</xref>). Failure to achieve synthesis signals to practitioners that organizational science has abandoned them, which in turn increases the likelihood that organization studies will alienate a key supporter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056492611403485">De Cock and Jeanes (2006)</xref> suggested that social pressure also increases the likelihood of theory integration, as efforts at maintaining the incommensurability position and cultivating theory-group conflict are viewed as unprofessional. In addition, synthesis may be actively sought by theory groups themselves in the interest of group maintenance. When synthesis occurs, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611403485">Mullins and Mullins (1973)</xref>, it is likely to begin at the periphery of theory groups. However, this assumes that the core of a theory group is myopic and relatively nonadaptable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056492611403485">Chubin (1976)</xref> argued that scholars in the core pay close attention to the activities of the periphery and seek to selectively integrate innovations occurring there into the main body of the theory group itself. If one of the important mechanisms of theory-group longevity is an openness to innovations, this suggested that integrationism is in certain cases a central part of intratheory-group activities rather than just a phenomenon of the periphery. The fact that the dominant theory groups in organization studies have cohered so well for so long may be because of their selective willingness to synthesize old core ideas with innovative ones.</p>
<p>However, it is certain that the synthesis of organizational theories is no easy task. Efforts to merge theories often fail (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611403485">Cao &amp; Nee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1056492611403485">Zhou, 2000</xref>, with respect to Nee’s market transition theory). Despite these obstacles, the idea of synthesis in the organization-environment field remained popular (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056492611403485">Cannella &amp; Paetzold, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492611403485">Donaldson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1056492611403485">McKelvey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1056492611403485">Perrow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1056492611403485">Schultz &amp; Hatch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1056492611403485">Weaver &amp; Gioia, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1056492611403485">Willmott, 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1056492611403485">Zucker, 1989</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1056492611403485">
<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>I focus on the subfield of organization studies focusing on organization-environment relationships, which contains four of the more influential theory groups in all of organization studies: NIS, OE, RD, and TCE. The choice to focus on these four theory groups, although subjective, is based on the ubiquity with which they are mentioned in reviews of the field (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492611403485">Clegg, Hardy, Lawrence, &amp; Nord, 2006</xref>). Additional theory groups are often listed in these reviews only if the author adheres to the theory group in question (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492611403485">Donaldson, 1995</xref>, with respect to structural contingency theory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1056492611403485">Hirsch, 1997</xref>, with respect to old institutionalism). Other theory groups are excluded for other reasons. For example, although a review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056492611403485">Davis and Powell (1992)</xref> also lists Network Theory as an organization-environment theory group, it is omitted from consideration here as Network Theory is not strictly an organizational theory. Despite the influence of Perrow’s environmental-control argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1056492611403485">Perrow, 2002</xref>), it is not focused on here because a coherent group of scholars has failed to coalesce around Perrow (and thus, this branch of theory fails to meet Mullins and Mullins’ definition of theory group).</p>
<p>This article addresses three central questions: Is there evidence in the record of critiques and exchanges between organization-environment scholars to support the idea that a paradigm war had taken place? If so, what effect has the period of heightened theory-group conflict had on intertheory-group interactions? Given the claim of incommensurability made by some, are there signs of either deepening incommensurability or movements toward synthesis in the 10 years that has passed since the height of the incommensurability debate?</p>
<p>With respect to the first of these questions, I reviewed the timing and content of 23 published critiques and critical exchanges written by various organization scholars with respect to NIS, RD, OE, and TCE. The frequency of these publications suggest that there were three distinct periods: (a) the relatively peaceful period of <italic>emergence</italic>, during which each theory group’s foundational statements were published and awareness of them spread; (b) the period of <italic>conflict</italic>, during which the number of critiques and exchanges grew in number and became more confrontational; and (c) the <italic>postconflict</italic> period, where confrontational exchanges substantially decreased but the incommensurability debate strengthened to gain insight into the two latter questions. Although the content of the critiques and exchanges varied, the most frequently appearing theme involved the strong questioning of a given theory group’s foundational assumptions.</p>
<p>With respect to the latter two questions, I examined citation patterns among and between these four theory groups. I present findings from Poisson, negative binomial, and linear regressions of 656 publications authored or coauthored by one or more of the foundational figures from the NIS, OE, RD, and TCE theory groups. The analysis focuses on the latter two periods, 1985 to 1994 and 1995 to 2008, and shows that movement toward “nonconsumption,” rather than toward synthesis, characterizes the organization-environment subfield and that the paradigm wars played a key role in setting this process in motion.</p>

<title>Defining the Emergence, Conflict, and Postconflict Periods</title>
<p>The first two organization-environment theories emerged in the late 1960s through the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1056492611403485">Thompson (1967)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1056492611403485">Lawrence and Lorsch (1967)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1056492611403485">Perrow (1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1056492611403485">1985b</xref>). The former three authors’ work collectively formed the basis for the Structural Contingency Theory Group whereas Perrow’s work became the core of a second. The four organization-environment theory groups that are the focus of the present study—NIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056492611403485">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1056492611403485">J. W. Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977</xref>), RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1056492611403485">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>), OE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492611403485">Aldrich &amp; Pfeffer, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492611403485">Hannan &amp; Freeman, 1977</xref>), and TCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1056492611403485">Williamson, 1975</xref>)—emerged from this body of work about 10 years later (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056492611403485">Davis &amp; Powell, 1992</xref>, for a detailed review).</p>
<p>To examine temporal patterns in the publication of critiques and exchanges over time, I reviewed the tables of contents of 11 highly ranked academic journals (according to Institute for Scientific Information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1056492611403485">[ISI] Web of Knowledge, 2008</xref>) from January 1, 1967 through December 31, 2008. Journals reviewed were stratified by academic field to better ensure coverage. I examined three sociology journals (<italic>American Journal of Sociology, American Sociological Review</italic>, and <italic>Annual Review of Sociology</italic>), four economics journals (<italic>Econometrica, Journal of Political Economy, Quarterly Journal of Economics</italic>, and <italic>Annual Review of Economics</italic>), and four business/management science journals (<italic>Administrative Science Quarterly, Academy of Management Review, Journal of Business</italic>, and <italic>Academy of Management Journal</italic>). I identified critiques and exchanges by examining the book review and commentary sections of the selected journals and by searching for the following title keywords: “review,” “reply,” “comment,” and “rebuttal.”</p>
<p>In all, 23 critiques and exchanges were identified, consisting primarily of book reviews and research comments. Although this set is certainly not comprehensive—I did not pursue critiques contained in the literature-review sections of books or full-length journal articles, for example—it is sufficiently broad to determine trends in conflict level. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1056492611403485">Table 1</xref> lists the critiques and exchanges between organization-environment scholars published in these journals over the years, ordered by the year in which the critique was published. What is immediately evident is the spike in the number of critiques and exchanges in the late 1980s. Of the 23 critiques listed, nearly half (11) were published between 1985 and 1994. The two other periods contain substantially fewer exchanges; 7 during 1975 to 1984 and 5 during 1995 to 2008. I empirically defined the three time periods compared in this article by observing the spike in the number of critiques and critical exchanges during 1985 to 1994 (i.e., the conflict period). The two periods of relatively little critical debate between theory groups, 1967 to 1984 and 1995 to 2008, correspond to the emergence and postconflict periods, respectively.</p>

<p>TCE (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1056492611403485">Williamson, 1975</xref>), organizational economists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056492611403485">Barney &amp; Ouchi, 1986</xref>), and economic historians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056492611403485">Chandler, 1977</xref>) were criticized for their unrealistic view of human nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492611403485">Donaldson, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1056492611403485">Granovetter, 1985</xref>) and for assuming that the organizational forms that came to dominate did so because they were more efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1056492611403485">Eccles, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1056492611403485">Freeland, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1056492611403485">Perrow, 1981</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1056492611403485">Smith and Mick (1985)</xref> criticized RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056492611403485">Cook, Shortell, Conrad, &amp; Morrisey, 1983</xref>), arguing that resource dependencies sometimes create symbiosis rather than vulnerability.</p>

<title>Defending Theory-Group Boundaries</title>
<p>Although small in number, it was interesting to find three articles where scholars critiqued the work of those who actually tried to incorporate the work of two distinct organization-environment theory groups. These exchanges are particularly important as they speak to the difficulties associated with attempted theory-group synthesis.</p>
<p>OE scholars tried to incorporate the NIS concept of legitimacy into their theories of density dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056492611403485">Carroll &amp; Hannan, 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1056492611403485">Hannan, Carroll, Dundon, &amp; Torres, 1995</xref>) but met with stiff resistance from both NIS and OE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611403485">Baum &amp; Powell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1056492611403485">Zucker, 1989</xref>). Others made more sweeping defenses of theory-group boundaries. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1056492611403485">Lutz (1982)</xref> argued that each of the four (then new) organization-environment theory groups (NIS, RD, OE, and TCE) be discarded because the preexisting theory groups offered a more sufficient array of tools that managers could use in practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1056492611403485">Lotto (1983)</xref> defended the newcomers in this instance, but others have also made the argument that new theories be jettisoned in favor of the old (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056492611403485">Donaldson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1056492611403485">Young, 1988</xref>). Although granting the desirability of theory-group synthesis 10 years later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492611403485">Donaldson (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492611403485">1996</xref>) remained a defender of theory-group boundaries by envisioning the synthesis of newer theories <italic>within</italic> the Structural Contingency Theory Group rather than the synthesis of all organization-environment theory groups on equal terms.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<sec id="section11-1056492611403485">
<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>To gather articles representing the “historical core” of each organization-environment theory group, I first sought to identify the foundational figures for each. NIS has five such persons: John W. Meyer, Brian Rowan, W. Richard Scott, Paul J. DiMaggio, and Walter W. Powell. OE has four such persons: Michael T. Hannan, John H. Freeman, Glenn R. Carroll, and Howard E. Aldrich. RD has two such persons: Jeffrey Pfeffer and Gerald R. Salancik. TCE has only one, Oliver E. Williamson.</p>
<p>I conducted a search in the Social Science Citation Index (a subset of the Web of Knowledge database) for all articles authored or coauthored (and published between 1967 and 2008) by any 1 of these 12 foundational figures. The year 1967 was selected as the starting year as this is when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1056492611403485">Perrow (1985b)</xref> suggests work on the organization-environment nexus first took solid form. In total, I identified 656 articles (providing over 25,000 bibliographic entries) with complete information on the authors, publication year, article title, number of citations received since publication, total number of bibliographic entries in the article, and the name of the first author for each of the bibliographic entries. The information on all variables was extracted into and analyzed using SPSS 16.0. I assigned each of the 656 articles a theory-group classification based on the author(s)’ own theory-group membership. In the four cases where an article had two or more authors from different theory groups, the article was classified as multiple group.</p>
<p>By looking at the lead author, I classified each bibliographic entry into one of the seven theory-group categories: NIS, OE, RD, TCE, Structural Contingency Theory, Perrowian, or interdisciplinary. If the lead author of a particular bibliographic entry was a foundational figure in a theory group, the classification was straightforward. In the other cases, a given bibliographic entry was classified into a theory group based on whether its lead author had either (a) appeared as coauthor with a foundational figure two or more times in the 656 articles analyzed, or (b) collaborated as coauthor with a foundational figure only once but was also cited in the article in which they collaborated, or (c) had appeared multiple times in one or more of the published reviews of a given theory group. The reviews of NIS I utilized were authored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492611403485">Brinton and Nee (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1056492611403485">Nee (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1056492611403485">Powell and DiMaggio (1991)</xref>. The reviews of OE were by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611403485">Baum (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492611403485">Baum and Shipilov (2006)</xref>. The reviews of RD were authored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1056492611403485">Pfeffer (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611403485">Casciaro and Pisorski (2005)</xref>. TCE was reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1056492611403485">Geyskens, Steenkamp, and Kumar (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1056492611403485">Williamson (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1056492611403485">2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492611403485">Donaldson (1996)</xref> provided a review of Structural Contingency Theory. No review was required for the work of Perrow.</p>
<p>Following these classification steps, I aggregated the 25,000+ bibliographic entries to create variable information for each of the 656 articles on the total number of each of the three types of bibliographic entries: intratheory group, intertheory group, and other. The aggregation procedure also yielded information on the average publication year for each of the three categories. Variable information on an article’s theory-group classification, publication year (recoded into publication era according to the date ranges described earlier), total number of bibliographic entries, and total number of citations received were obtained directly from the Social Science Citation Index database. Of the 656 articles, 195 were from NIS, 257 from OE, 121 from RD, and 78 from TCE.</p>

<sec id="section12-1056492611403485">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>I analyzed this data using three methods: Poisson, negative binomial, and linear regression. The more predominant bibliometric method—cocitation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1056492611403485">Noma, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1056492611403485">Small, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1056492611403485">1980</xref>)—was not employed for two reasons. First, using counts of citation pairs (i.e., counts of how many times particular pairs of individuals are cited in the same article) limits one’s ability to make and use theory-group classifications in the analysis. With cocitation analysis, it is feasible to analyze citation patterns in an entire discipline and the assignment of theory-group classifications is relatively straightforward. However, it does not allow one to easily discern why a given article was classified as a member of a particular theory group. In other words, one does not know if an article classified as a part of a theory group would even be recognized by the established members of the theory group itself. The reduced ability to differentiate between work from a theory group’s periphery and its core makes the interpretation of intra- and intertheory-group citation patterns more difficult. Second, using cocitation analysis does not allow one to examine the age of the cited source (as the object of interest are citation pairs rather than single citations). Observations of whether citations are of old versus new sources, for example, lends some insight into whether the citation was given as a matter of routine or if it was given because the article discussed the cited work in more detail.</p>
<p>When a count of the number of bibliographic entries was the dependent variable, I used either Poisson or negative binomial regression. Poisson regression, the more parsimonious of the two models, was used in those cases where overdispersion was absent (i.e., the mean and variance of the dependent variable were not significantly different according to the Lagrange multiplier test). Negative binomial regression, which is more robust with respect to overdispersion, was used in the remaining cases. The intermingled use of the two models is acceptable because they are quite closely related and the interpretation of their coefficients is identical. The three dependent variables analyzed by Poisson or negative binomial regression were as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1056492611403485" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>total number of bibliographic entries first authored by one of the article’s authors (i.e., self-citation) plus the total number of bibliographic entries first authored by another person within the same theory group, a measure of intratheory-group citation frequency;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>total number of bibliographic entries first authored by an individual associated with a alternative organization-environment theory group, a measure of intertheory-group citation frequency; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>total number of bibliographic entries first authored by any individual other than the two above, a measure of citation frequency for all remaining publications.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The Poisson and negative binomial models used were of the following form: ln(E(Y)) = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>i</sub>X<sub>i</sub> + ϵ, using theory-group classification, date of publication, number of citations received, and number of publications listed in the article’s bibliography as predictors. When a difference between publication years was the dependent variable, I used linear (ordinary least squares [OLS]) regression. Linear regression is appropriate because (a) publication year and average publication year are approximately normally distributed and therefore (b) the difference between publication year and average publication years is also approximately normally distributed. The three dependent variables analyzed with this method were the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1056492611403485" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>difference between an article’s publication year and the average publication year of the intratheory-group bibliographic entries associated with an article, a measure of how up to date an article’s bibliography is with respect to its own theory group;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>difference between an article’s publication year and the average publication year of the intertheory-group bibliographic entries associated with an article, a measure of how up to date an article’s bibliography is with respect to other theory groups; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>difference between the average publication year of the intratheory-group bibliographic entries and the average publication year of the intertheory-group bibliographic entries associated with an article, a measure of how up to date an article’s bibliography is with intratheory-group publications relative to intertheory-group works.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The linear regression models used were of the following form: E(Y) = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>i</sub>X<sub>i</sub> + ϵ, also using theory-group classification, date of publication, number of citations received, and number of publications listed in the article’s bibliography as predictors.</p>

<title>Trends in the Number of Bibliographic Entries Over Time</title>
<p>The results of the Poisson and negative binomial regression models provide evidence that the conflict period negatively impacted intertheory-group citations in the postconflict period. The average number of intertheory-group bibliographic entries (the middle column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1056492611403485">Table 2</xref>) remained stable from 1967-1984 to 1985-1994 (as shown by the nonsignificant coefficient for the emergence era). However, between the latter two periods (1985-1994 to 1995-2008), the number of intertheory-group bibliographic entries decreased by 16.1%. This drop is more vivid when one compares this trend with the patterns for number of intratheory-group and all remaining bibliographic entries. The number of intratheory-group bibliographic entries (the leftmost column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1056492611403485">Table 2</xref>) increased by 69.0% from 1967-1984 to 1985-1994, then remained stable from 1995 to 2008 (again, by virtue of the nonsignificant regression coefficient). The number of bibliographic entries allotted to all other types of publications remained stable across all three periods. The contrast between the drop in the number of intertheory-group bibliographic entries with the stability in the number of intratheory-group bibliographic entries and the stability in the number of all other reference types between the latter two periods clearly suggests decreased citation between theory groups rather than synthesis.</p>

<title>Trends in Differentials Between Average Publication Years</title>
<p>The results of the linear regression models provide additional evidence that the conflict period negatively impacted intertheory-group citations in the postconflict period. After controlling for theory-group classification, number of citations received, and number of bibliographic entries, the first regression (leftmost column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1056492611403485">Table 3</xref>) shows that the difference between an article’s publication year and the average publication year for intratheory-group bibliographic entries has been slowly increasing over time (by 2.634 years between the 1975-1984 and 1985-1994 periods and by 1.572 years between the 1985-1994 and 1995-2008 periods). The second regression (middle column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1056492611403485">Table 3</xref>) shows a very different pattern with respect to the difference between an article’s publication year and the average publication year for intertheory-group bibliographic entries. Here, the difference did not significantly change between the 1975 to 1984 and 1985 to 1994 periods but dramatically widened between the 1985 to 1994 and 1995 to 2008 periods. The correspondence between the timing of theory-group conflict and the timing of this widening suggests that theory-group conflict may have had a negative effect on how up-to-date authors’ citations of alternative views are relative to citations of their own theory group’s works.</p>

<p>The pattern of decreased intertheory-group citation is confirmed when one compares plots of the predicted difference in years graphically (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1056492611403485">Figure 2</xref>).

In 1975 to 1984, organization-environment scholars were between 3 and 4 years (i.e., 7.60 vs. 3.89 years) less up to date on the literatures of alternative theory groups than they were on the literatures of their own theory groups. This gap narrowed somewhat in 1985 to 1994 (to slightly over 2 years, i.e., 8.68 vs. 6.52 years), but by 1995 to 2008 it had grown to a difference of slightly over 5 years (i.e., 13.28 vs. 8.09 years).</p>

<p>The third regression in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1056492611403485">Table 3</xref> (rightmost column) provides a more direct comparison of intratheory- and intertheory-group citation patterns by comparing the average publication year for intratheory-group bibliographic entries with the average publication year for intertheory-group bibliographic entries. Between the 1975 to 1984 and 1985 to 1994 periods, there was no significant change. It was only following the period of theory-group conflict that the gap began to widen. Between the 1985 to 1994 and 1995 to 2008 periods, the difference between average publication years for intratheory- and intertheory-group bibliographic entries widened by 2.941 years. This means that, on average, over the last 10 years authors had become almost 3 years less up to date on the literatures of alternative views than they were on the literature of their own view.</p>

<title>Differences in Average Bibliography Size for the Alternative Theory Groups</title>
<p>A comparison of the number of intratheory- and intertheory-group citations, stratified by theory group, indicates that the tendency to preferentially cite work from one’s own theory group was not homogeneously distributed. The number of bibliographic entries allotted to intratheory-group publications is highest for the set of interdisciplinary articles analyzed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1056492611403485">Table 2</xref>). Compared with TCE (the reference group in this case), interdisciplinary articles, perhaps not surprisingly, have 46.2% more bibliographic entries dedicated to one of the author’s own theory groups. OE had 13.7% more bibliographic space dedicated to intratheory-group publications. NIS and RD scholars had significantly fewer bibliographic entries dedicated to intratheory-group works (51.1% less for the former and 54.5% less for the latter). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1056492611403485">Table 2</xref> also shows that all three sociological theory groups and the interdisciplinary articles had substantially more intertheory-group bibliographic entries. RD scholars had, relative to TCE, the highest number (1156.6% more). However, NIS, OE, and interdisciplinary work still had substantially more intertheory-group bibliographic entries (680.7% more, 1108.5% more, and 709.3% more, respectively).</p>
<p>However, with respect to the number of bibliographic entries allotted to all other types of publications TCE compared quite favorably (see again <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1056492611403485">Table 2</xref>). Although RD scholars had 18.5% more bibliographic space dedicated to this type of publication, NIS had 25.3% fewer, OE had 15.6% fewer, and interdisciplinary articles had 20.9% fewer. The contrast between this pattern and the one presented in the second part of the preceding paragraph is perhaps best explained as a disciplinary difference. As a norm, TCE scholars are likely encouraged to relate their work to other economists’ works (which would be classified here as “all other types”) rather than to most strongly engage with the work of noneconomists (i.e., sociologists of any theory group; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492611403485">Becher &amp; Trowler, 2001</xref> for a recent review of the dynamics behind disciplinary boundary maintenance).</p>

<title>The Effects of Number of Citations Received and Bibliography Size</title>
<p>The number of citations received by an article was included in the model to control for the possibility that appeals to multiple audiences through high numbers of intertheory-group citations that would lead to a higher number of received citations. However, the results show that this variable had no relationship to the number of intratheory-group bibliographic entries, intertheory-group entries, or entries for all remaining types (see again <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1056492611403485">Table 2</xref>). In all cases, whether it was significant, the magnitude of the unstandardized coefficient never exceeded 0.001 (corresponding to a 0.1% difference in number of bibliographic entries of a given type).</p>
<p>The additional sources cited in publications with larger bibliographies tended to be approximately equally distributed between intratheory-group citations and intertheory-group citations. In each of the three regressions performed, the coefficient for “total number of bibliographic entries” was highly significant (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). The magnitude of these coefficients ranged between 0.019 and 0.036 overall. Articles with larger bibliographies had approximately 2.9% more intratheory-group bibliographic entries, 1.9% more intertheory-group entries, and 3.7% more entries for all other types of publications. Mostly, however, the value of the variable total number of bibliographic entries was as a statistical control.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The review of 23 published critiques and critical exchanges in the organization-environment subfield supports the idea that a period of heightened intertheory-group conflict occurred from 1985 to 1994. A review of the content of these critiques showed that the most frequently appearing theme involved the strong questioning of a given theory group’s foundational assumptions. Poisson and negative binomial models show that, between the conflict (1985-1994) and postconflict (1995-2008) periods, the number of intratheory-group citations increased by 69% whereas the number of intertheory-group citations dropped by 16.1%. Linear regression models show that the average age of the publications cited by a given article had risen more with respect to alternative theory groups than for the article’s own theory group (a 4.6 year increase in the average age vs. a 1.6 year increase, respectively).</p>
<p>Recall that, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611403485">Mullins and Mullins’ (1973)</xref> model, concepts from mature theory groups become the foundation for future theoretical innovations through an orderly process. Although not explicitly ruling out the possibility of intertheory-group conflict, the model does not predict what the effects of conflict might be. The results of the present study show that one effect is a decreased level of citation between the theory groups that were party to an episode of deconstructive intertheory-group conflict (recall that 11 of the 23 debates I identified from the organizations-environments literature were existential in orientation, consisting of critiques of another theory groups’ underlying assumptions). Within the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492611403485">Hassard and Kelemen (2002)</xref> typology of responses to sustained theory multiplicity, the citation evidence suggests that nonconsumption became the predominant response, rather than integrationism, protectionism, pluralism, or postmodernism (all of which require intertheory-group citation). Pressures against practicing nonconsumption, for example from those who value organizational theory as a business tool (see again <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1056492611403485">McKinley &amp; Mone, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1056492611403485">Scherer &amp; Steinmann, 1999</xref>) and from advocates of scientific detachment (see again <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056492611403485">De Cock &amp; Jeanes, 2006</xref>), appear to be less-important factors in the context of sustained theory-group conflict.</p>
<p>The debate between OE and NIS over “density-dependence” theory serves as a useful example of the connections between theory-group conflict, citation patterns, and long-run theory development. Proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056492611403485">Carroll and Hannan (1989a)</xref>, density-dependence theory sought to incorporate NIS conceptions of organizational legitimacy into ecological models of population-level organizational change. The effort, which began during the conflict period, was met quickly and repeatedly with criticism from NIS scholars (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611403485">Baum &amp; Powell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1056492611403485">Petersen &amp; Koput, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1056492611403485">Zucker, 1989</xref>). Although OE scholars continued to advance density-dependence theory steadily over the next 15 years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056492611403485">Dobrev, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492611403485">Dobrev, Ozdemir, &amp; Teo, 2006</xref>), the intertheory-group citations found in these latter works were increasingly out of date with respect to recent NIS work on the organizational legitimacy concept. Without ever having been empirically refuted but rooted in intellectually contested terrain, density-dependence theory became increasingly inward looking and was, as a result, effectively abandoned by its OE founders (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1056492611403485">Hannan, Polos, &amp; Carroll, 2007</xref>). In the density-dependence case, the period of intertheory-group conflict was associated with a change in citation patterns, which in turn was associated with the stagnation of theory development.</p>
<p>The explanation for the findings advocated here, namely, that heightened conflict between theory groups leads to nonconsumption rather than adjudication and synthesis, has important implications for our knowledge of the scientific process more generally. First, the findings suggest that the process of theory-group emergence and decline is much less orderly than implied by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611403485">Mullins and Mullins (1973)</xref> model. Existing theory groups, if burnished by conflict, may serve to antagonize and delay new ideas rather than serving as a more benign background from which new theory groups emerge. This may stem from limitations on scientists’ academic energies; the time required to participate or monitor an ongoing conflict may divert or discourage scholars from developing newer alternatives. Second, conflict-related processes may provide one explanation for why Kuhnian scientific revolutions appear so revolutionary to us. Revolutions, almost by definition, cannot occur unless there is an accumulated tension between those who wish to preserve the existing order and those who wish to transcend or replace it. For scientific fields, revolutionary ideas may instead appear more or less evolutionary were it not for the absence of incremental synthesis that heightened conflict can inadvertently cause. Revolutions might therefore represent a return to a normal scientific process rather than a departure from it. I do not wish to advocate that all conflict is detrimental to the scientific process, but do suggest that heightened conflict may produce unanticipated adverse consequences.</p>
<sec id="section19-1056492611403485">
<title>Alternative Explanations</title>
<p>There are several alternative explanations for the findings that need to be explored. First, the diminishing frequency of intertheory-group citations might be the result of specialization processes. As the organization-environment subfield grew, the number of publications within it also grew substantially, over time reaching the point where scholars could only stay up to date with studies from their own theory group (an argument made explicitly by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1056492611403485">McKinley et al., 1999</xref>). This explanation can partially account for disparities between the raw numbers of intratheory- and intertheory-group citations (i.e., you will cite more from your own specialty because you are more aware of the work being done within it). However, one has to take into account that there are multiple recent and highly visible reviews published on NIS, OE, RD, and TCE (see again <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611403485">Baum, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492611403485">Baum &amp; Shipilov, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611403485">Casciaro &amp; Pisorski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1056492611403485">Geyskens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1056492611403485">Pfeffer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1056492611403485">Williamson, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1056492611403485">2005</xref>). Although specialization processes may lead to fewer intertheory-group citations over time, one should expect these to be of relatively recent works. This study’s finding that intertheory-group citations tend to be increasingly out of date does not support this alternative explanation.</p>
<p>Second, the diminishing frequency of intertheory-group citations might simply be the result of the maturation of the subfield. In the formative years of the organization-environment literature, scholars needed to cite one another frequently to establish their own position. However, once each theory group became more established, the need to do so diminished as more intratheory-group citation became possible. The data do not seem to support this explanation either. If changes in citation frequency derived from field-maturation processes, one would expect the frequency of intertheory-group citations to monotonically decrease. Instead, the results presented here show that intertheory-group citation frequencies actually rose by 7.2% between 1967 to 1984 and 1985 to 1994 before beginning to decrease.</p>
<p>Third, the growing tendency to be less up to date with alternative theory groups might be an artifact of decreasing publication rates in the organization-environment subfield. If there are relatively few contemporary publications, a scholar would have little choice but to cite the older works in the field. The data do not support this explanation either. Of the 656 articles analyzed by Poisson or negative binomial regression, 39.48% were published in 1975 to 1984, 25.15% in 1985 to 1994, and 35.37% in 1995 to 2008. The rates of article publication seem to have remained fairly stable over time rather than diminished.</p>
<p>Finally, the classic sociology of science reasons for theory-group stability may also apply. Scholars whose careers are tied to a particular theory group may have a vested interest in the continued existence of the group, to the degree that such group membership makes the reward system of the academy more navigable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1056492611403485">Cole, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056492611403485">1994</xref>). If theory-group existence and membership increases a young scholar’s publication rate—publication rates have long been viewed as potentially more central to the scientific process than empirical correctness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1056492611403485">Latour &amp; Woolgar, 1979</xref>)—then such scholars have less of a reason to strive for new theory-group formation. However, this line of argument only holds so long as the existing theory groups are sufficiently broad to allow young scholars to seek dramatic findings within a theory group’s domain.</p>

<sec id="section20-1056492611403485">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limiting factors that need to be considered. First, an implicit assumption of all citation analyses is that the citations examined are intellectually meaningful. Stated somewhat differently, citation analysis assumes that each citation serves as a meaningful indication of a relationship between the citing article and the cited source. In truth however, we do not know the reasons why a particular source was cited nor do we know how detailed the discussion of the cited source was. A cited source may be central to the citing article’s arguments or it may simply have been cited as a matter of routine (or anywhere in between). The linear regression analysis was included to help alleviate some of this limitation. By tracking the publication date of the cited source, we can begin to differentiate routine citations, which tend to be of the early foundational works, from citations which are more likely to be nonroutine. However, this limitation on the whole remains valid and the results need to be interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p>A second limitation lies with the method used to classify the 25,000+ cited references into a theory group. As described in the methods section, this classification was based on whether the lead author was a foundational figure, collaborated as a coauthor with a foundational figure, or mentioned prominently in one or more reviews of a particular theory group. The focus on the lead author for each of the cited references means that some number of these would be misclassified as “other” rather than as a member of a specific theory group if the foundational figure and the like appeared in any author position other than first. However, this limitation does not seriously threaten the results. If a particular scholar is important for a theory group, it is highly unlikely that they would fail to appear regularly as lead author on their published work. In other words, individuals who identify themselves with a specific theory group yet seldom achieve first-author status are likely to be highly peripheral.</p>
<p>Finally, the present study is limited by my choice to focus the analysis on the core of each theory group rather than on the whole of organization studies. In other words, the choice to use single-citation analysis rather than cocitation analysis raises the question of generalizability. The 12 foundational figures that are central to the present study are, to be sure, highly atypical scholars. Furthermore, synthetic combinations of two or more theory groups’ works is more likely to occur at the peripheries of the theory groups. However, if the core remains even moderately open to change, then evidence of synthesis—which is expected to be more visible in the periphery—should be visible in the core nonetheless (see again <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056492611403485">Chubin, 1976</xref>). Among adaptable theory groups, as each of the four theory groups focused here have been, citation patterns in the periphery and the core are likely to be very similar in the long run. As I have already argued, there are distinct advantages associated with the use of single-citation analysis in the present study (e.g., the higher likelihood of capturing meaningful group membership and the ability to examine the age of the cited source). However, a cocitation analysis could also be performed to more formally settle the question of generalizability.</p>
