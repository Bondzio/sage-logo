<p><italic>Aims</italic>: To investigate the confidence in primary health care, psychiatry and social services among the reindeer-herding Sami and the non-Sami population of northern Sweden. <italic>Methods</italic>: A semi-randomized, cross-sectional study design comprising 325 reindeer-herding Sami (171 men, 154 women) and a control population of 1,437 non-Sami (684 men, 753 women). A questionnaire on the confidence in primary health care, psychiatry, social services, and work colleagues was distributed to members of reindeer-herding families through the Sami communities and to the control population through the post. The relative risk for poor confidence was analyzed by calculating odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals adjusted for age and level of education. <italic>Results</italic>: The confidence in primary health care and psychiatry was significantly lower among the reindeer-herding Sami compared with the control group. No differences were found between men and women in the reindeer-herding Sami population. In both the reindeer-herding Sami and the control population, younger people (≤48 years) reported significantly lower confidence in primary health care than older individuals (&gt;48 years). <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: A conceivable reason for the poor confidence in health care organizations reported by the reindeer-herding Sami is that they experience health care staff as poorly informed about reindeer husbandry and Sami culture, resulting in unsuitable or unrealistic treatment suggestions. The findings suggest that the poor confidence constitutes a significant obstacle of the reindeer-herding Sami to fully benefit from public health care services.</bold></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The fundamental goal of the Swedish health care system is to provide citizens with the best possible care and treatment based on each individual’s needs, regardless of age, sex, education, income, ethnicity or religion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812453971">1</xref>]. The individual’s dignity and respect for the equal value of all people should be guiding principles in the health care system. The legislation states that health care services should be easily available and should promote good contact between the patient and health care staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812453971">1</xref>].</p>
<p>These are all good intentions but in reality they are quite difficult to live up to. In an international perspective, the overall health of the Swedish population is excellent. Yet, there are groups in which the incidence of disease, life expectancy and mortality rates deviate substantially from the average, in particular socioeconomically underprivileged groups such as the long-term unemployed, refugees and some of the ethnic minority groups (for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812453971">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812453971">3</xref>]).</p>
<p>One of these ethnic minority groups, the Sami, are the indigenous population of the northern Scandinavian Peninsula, and they have suffered marginalization, stigmatization and discrimination for centuries. Although the epidemiological transition in the Sami probably peaked in the late 19th century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812453971">4</xref>], there are still indications of significant health problems within this ethnic group. Compared with non-Sami Swedes, they have an increased risk of stomach cancer and increasing risks over time for leukaemia and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812453971">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812453971">6</xref>]. The mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases are higher than among non-Sami Swedes, as is their incidence of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812453971">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812453971">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Most Sami have adopted an ordinary Western way of living, with e.g. modern professions and similar food habits as in the general population. Less than 2,000 Sami, about 5% of the total Sami population, are economically dependent on reindeer husbandry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812453971">7</xref>]. The conditions for reindeer herding, which is an important cultural activity and occupation among the Sami, have changed dramatically over recent decades. The reindeer’s traditional grazing land has been reduced and fragmented due to the expanding forestry and tourist industries, mining, and hydroelectric and wind power stations. These intrusions, together with a national carnivore conservation policy that is in conflict with the interests of the reindeer-herding Sami, have severely decreased the profitability of reindeer husbandry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812453971">9</xref>]. Conflicts between the Sami communities, other commercial interests and government authorities, as well as between different Sami communities, have become more common. Many Sami have lost, or have low expectations of being able to continue, their reindeer-herding culture and lifestyle. Consequently, the psychosocial wellbeing of the reindeer-herding Sami is relatively poor compared with the majority population. Recent studies have shown increased suicide rates, high frequencies of depression and anxiety, poor quality of life, high work demands and a high prevalence of musculoskeletal problems, as well as high incidences of fatal occupational accidents among the reindeer herders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812453971">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812453971"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812453971"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812453971"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812453971"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812453971">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Finding a balance between on the one hand the rights of the Sami to maintain their cultural heritage, good health and quality of life, and on the other the national striving to increase resources for the common good is indeed a complex issue. However, one of the prerequisites is that there are health care systems and social services that are organized and have sufficient knowledge and resources to support the health not only of the majority population but also of minority groups with specific needs and problems. One way of investigating this basic requirement is to evaluate the confidence in the health care system expressed by the majority population and minority groups, respectively.</p>
<p>In Norway, Sami-speaking patients have been reported to be less satisfied with the municipal general practitioner services as compared to Norwegian-speaking patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812453971">16</xref>]. In the same geographical setting it has been indicated that mental health and mental health services vary with ethnicity. Therapists prescribe more therapy sessions and more socially focused interventions when patients are Sami, and ethnic matching between patient and therapist indicated increased therapeutic success rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812453971">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812453971">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the confidence in primary health care, psychiatric care and social services among reindeer-herding Sami and the non-Sami majority population in northern Sweden.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study is a semi-randomized, cross-sectional study. It was approved by the regional ethics committee at Umeå University and conforms to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, and the International Guidelines for ethical review for epidemiological studies.</p>
<p>Individuals from reindeer-herding Sami families from 42 Sami communities (“<italic>Samebyar</italic>” in Swedish) were invited to participate in the study. In spring 2009, a questionnaire was distributed through the chairperson of each Sami community to family members considered to be actively involved in reindeer-herding activities. A total of 640 adult (≥16 years) family members fulfilled this inclusion criterion. Of these, 357 decided to participate after being fully informed about the aim of the study, the principal contents of the questionnaire, the confidentiality measures, and their right to withdraw from the study at any time. Thirty-two individuals were excluded from the data analyses because of too many unanswered questions (final response rate, 50.8%).</p>
<p>A control population was taken from both urban and rural environments, i.e. from the three main towns of northern Sweden (Umeå, Luleå, Östersund) and from four sparsely populated rural districts (Härjedalen, Krokom, Sorslele and Jokkmokk). Using a randomization procedure, 1,000 individuals between 18 and 85 years of age were selected from the towns and 1,000 from the sparsely populated communities. In spring 2007, a postal questionnaire was distributed. After two reminders the questionnaire was answered and returned by 1,441 persons, all sufficiently complete to enable statistical analyses (final response rate, 72.1%). Thirty-five of these identified themselves as Sami, of which four were reindeer herders (all men). The four reindeer-herding Sami were excluded from the control group.</p>
<p>The questionnaire contained questions on sociodemographic conditions (age, level of education, employment/retirement, occupation, residence, marital status and household data) and level of confidence in different health care providers. The question on confidence was phrased <italic>“Indicate the extent of confidence you have in each of the following: primary health care centres, psychiatric care, social services and work colleagues.”</italic> Each entity had four response alternatives: very high confidence, quite high confidence, quite low confidence, and no confidence at all.</p>
<p>The analyses were performed using SPSS (version 11.5, SPSS Inc., USA). The ages of the study populations were normally distributed and are presented as means with standard deviations (SD) and ranges. Comparisons of average age were made by one-way ANOVA (four groups, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812453971">Table I</xref>) and independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test (two groups). The frequency data on the level of education, household status and main occupation were compared by Kruskal-Wallis test (four groups, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812453971">Table I</xref>) and by Mann-Whitney U-test (two groups). A <italic>p</italic>-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>To evaluate the relative risk for low confidence in primary health care, psychiatry, social services and work colleagues, univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The regression models were performed on dichotomized data, where low confidence corresponds to the response alternatives “quite low confidence” and “no confidence at all”, and high confidence to the response alternatives “very high confidence” and “quite high confidence”. To assess the relative risk for distrust in health care authorities in general, ORs with 95% CIs were calculated for low confidence in primary health care, psychiatry and social services. For comparison, ORs with 95% CIs were calculating for low confidence in work colleagues.</p>
<p>Since there were significant differences between the four groups regarding average age and highest level of education, all crude ORs were adjusted for these variables. The differences in household status did not significantly influence the regression models and were therefore excluded from the models presented.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812453971">Table I</xref> shows sociodemographic characteristics for reindeer-herding Sami men and women and the control group. Age, education level, household status and occupation were significantly different between the four groups. Compared to the control group, the reindeer-herding Sami were somewhat younger and contained a larger proportion of families with both adults and children and a smaller proportion of adults cohabiting with other adults. The educational level was highest among reindeer-herding Sami women and lowest among reindeer-herding Sami men. The difference in main occupation in the Sami group was that almost 90% of the men but only 48% of the women reported reindeer herding as their main occupation.</p>

<p>The relative risk for reporting low confidence in primary health care and psychiatry was significantly larger among men and women of the reindeer-herding Sami group as compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812453971">Table II)</xref>. The reindeer-herding Sami women showed a larger risk for low confidence in work colleagues compared with control women, whereas no such difference was found between the men of the reindeer-herding Sami and control groups.</p>
<p>Since reindeer-herding Sami live in the sparsely populated rural areas of northern Sweden, while the non-Sami control population in the present study was compiled from both rural and urban areas, it is possible that geographically related factors could have caused some of the differences in confidence observed between the two groups. However, when the regression models of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812453971">Table II</xref> were adjusted for the rural–urban factor, there were only minor changes in the relative risk estimates. The only exception was for the relative risk for reindeer-herding Sami women to have low confidence in primary health care, which increased from OR 2.17 (95% CI 1.49-3.16) to OR 2.83 (95% CI 1.85-4.32).</p>
<p>Comparisons of low confidence between men and women in the reindeer-herding Sami and the control group respectively showed no significant gender differences within the reindeer-herding Sami group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494812453971">Table III</xref>). The same was the case in the control group, with the exception of men, who recorded somewhat lower confidence in psychiatry and in all three health care and social services organizations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main result of this study is that both men and women of reindeer-herding Sami families have lower confidence in health care organizations, particularly primary health care and psychiatric care, than men and women in the non-Sami control group. There were no differences between reindeer-herding Sami men and women. Younger people in both the reindeer-herding Sami and the control groups demonstrated lower confidence in primary health care than older people.</p>
<p>As the reindeer-herding Sami cohort of the present study is quite small, there might be a risk that the population poorly represents the diversity of the reindeer-herding Sami communities in Sweden. However, the number of people living in families where reindeer herding is an important source of income is quite small (less than 1,800 adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812453971">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812453971">14</xref>]), implying that the study population covered about 20% of the total reindeer-herding population in Sweden. One limitation, though, was that only Sami who were highly involved in reindeer husbandry were invited to participate.</p>
<p>The striking dissimilarity in level of education between men and women in the reindeer-herding Sami group is in agreement with findings in other cohorts of reindeer-herding Sami [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812453971">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812453971">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812453971">25</xref>]. Reindeer herding is not learned through university studies but by working together with experienced herders, which explains the low level of formal education among men. Women, on the other hand, have for economical reasons been forced to get employment in the regular labour market. In rural parts of Sweden the labour market for women is to a large extent restricted to positions where a university degree is mandatory, e.g. employments in health care, education and administration.</p>
<p>After centuries of discrimination and marginalization of the Sami people there is good reason to believe that a general distrust of the authorities and institutions of the majority society might be a partial explanation for the low confidence reported by the reindeer-herding Sami. It is well known that a high degree of satisfaction with health care providers is characterized by accessibility, kindness, attention, trust and encouragement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812453971">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812453971">20</xref>], and that the first contact with a care organization is very important for trust in the health care staff at subsequent contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812453971">21</xref>]. Data from interviews with reindeer-herding Sami have shown that they often have to explain their lifestyle and living conditions to health care staff and social workers, who generally know little of Sami culture (results in progress). Despite their efforts to explain their situation, they frequently feel that they are offered unrealistic treatment advice and therapeutic recommendations, e.g. to stop using snow mobiles, to go on sick leave or to get another occupation.</p>
<p>Among Norwegian Sami low satisfaction with primary health care has been suggested to be related to misunderstandings between physician and patient due to language problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812453971">16</xref>]. Although there is also a lack of knowledge of Sami language among the health care staff in Sweden, this is probably not the major reason for the low confidence expressed by the reindeer-herding Sami in the present study. If language problems were a significant issue one would expect the older Sami, among whom the Sami language is more frequently used than among the younger Sami, to show lower confidence compared to the younger Sami. However, the results indicated, rather, that the younger reindeer-herding Sami reported lower confidence than the older reindeer-herding Sami (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494812453971">Table IV</xref>).</p>
<p>Another reason for the low confidence in primary health care and psychiatry might be that some Sami are familiar with and still have confidence in traditional medicine and household remedies, which might conflict with the evidence-based medical approach of the Swedish health care system. Potential conflicts between traditional Sami medicine and modern evidence-based medicine should be investigated in future qualitative studies.</p>
<p>The reindeer-herding Sami women were nearly three times as likely to show low confidence in primary health care as non-Sami women living in the same rural setting. In northern Norway, it has been found that female Sami clients are under-represented in treatment programmes offered to people with drug and alcohol problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812453971">22</xref>]. This might of course be a consequence of low prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse among Sami women in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812453971">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812453971">24</xref>], but it cannot be excluded that low confidence in the public health care system might have contributed to the under-representation.</p>
<p>It is worrying that reindeer-herding Sami women in our study showed poor confidence not only in health care organizations but also in their work colleagues. In addition to their work in reindeer husbandry, many reindeer-herding Sami women hold regular jobs in the Swedish labour market. Recently it was found that women in reindeer-herding families, compared to non-Sami women, experience lower levels of social support in their work situation and poor quality of life in terms of social relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812453971">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812453971">25</xref>]. The psychosocial conditions of reindeer-herding Sami women seem to have declined over the last couple of decades due to increased responsibilities and stress induced by reduced profitability of reindeer husbandry, continued marginalization and discrimination of the reindeer-herding Sami, and by an increasing number of conflicts with authorities and commercial stakeholders of the majority society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812453971">14</xref>].</p>
<p>In spite of the crude age-group classification (above or below 48 years), significantly lower confidence in primary health care was observed in the younger age group, both among reindeer-herding Sami and non-Sami. This difference is perhaps not surprising considering that younger people are in general less dependent on health care and social services. Young people’s contact with health care is often through children, older relatives and friends with treatment needs. In earlier studies it has been shown that relatives are often less satisfied with the care than the patient herself/himself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812453971">26</xref>]. A contributory factor for the relatively poor confidence in health care and social services among younger people might be a low respect for authorities generally, possibly in combination with a greater awareness of the plethora of care alternatives and treatment possibilities.</p>
<p>It is a reasonable assumption that low confidence in the health care system could have negative consequences for the health of the reindeer-herding Sami. Epidemiological studies based on national diagnoses registers have indicated that the low incidences of cancer found among reindeer-herding Sami might partly result from under-diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812453971">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812453971">6</xref>]. It is also possible that the poor confidence in primary health care contributes to the high prevalence of musculoskeletal problems in the arms, hands and lower back observed among reindeer-herding Sami [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812453971">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812453971">14</xref>].</p>
<p>In the Swedish health care system no special measures are taken to address the specific needs and health problems of ethnic minorities, even though there are ethno-cultural factors that would justify such actions. A consequence is that such groups do not, in practice, enjoy the same accessibility to public health care facilities as the majority population. This contravenes Swedish health care legislation, which states that the principal goal of public health care is to provide the whole population with the best possible care on equal terms based on each individual’s need – regardless of age, sex, education, income, ethnicity or religion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812453971">1</xref>].</p>
<p>In 2007, the Swedish government was seriously criticized by the United Nations for the absence of a national strategy aimed at documenting and promoting the health conditions of the Sami people, and for not taking steps to improve the occupational health hazards of reindeer husbandry, thus neglecting its obligations to meet international conventions on the fundamental rights of indigenous people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812453971">27</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494812453971" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The results indicate that there is a shortage of confidence in primary health care and psychiatry among the reindeer-herding Sami of Sweden, which could reduce their possibilities to take advantage of public health care resources. Increased knowledge about the conditions of reindeer husbandry and Sami culture among health care staff and social workers, especially in sparsely populated areas, is a prerequisite for improving this confidence and thereby achieving equality between the majority population and the reindeer-herding Sami in accessibility to public health services.</p>
