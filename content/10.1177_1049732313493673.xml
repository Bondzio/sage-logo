<abstract>
<p>Individuals who experience loss of their physical abilities often face the challenges of adapting to a new way of life. Past research has shown that sport participation can assist the physical and psychological adaptation to acquired physical disabilities. The purposes of our study were to examine the following: (a) the resilience process of sport participants with acquired spinal cord injury, and (b) the role of sport participation in the resilience process. We conducted semistructured phenomenological interviews with 12 male quadriplegic wheelchair rugby players. Results show that the development of resilience is a multifactorial process involving pre-existing factors and pre-adversity experiences, disturbance/disturbing emotions, various types and sources of social support, special opportunities and experiences, various behavioral and cognitive coping strategies, motivation to adapt to changes, and learned attributes or gains from the resilience process. We discuss implications for future research and practice.</p>

<p>More than 36 million people live with disabilities in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732313493673">U.S. Census Bureau, 2011</xref>). One fourth of today’s 20 years olds will acquire some form of disability before retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732313493673">Social Security Administration, 2011</xref>). The trauma of losing one’s physical abilities elicits significant emotional (e.g., anxiety, depression; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732313493673">Hancock, Craig, Dickson, Chang, &amp; Martin, 1993</xref>) and psychosocial challenges (e.g., feelings of detachment from the social world; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313493673">Graham, Kremer, &amp; Wheeler, 2008</xref>), which can make rehabilitation and reintegration very difficult processes. However, there are many stories (anecdotal and empirical) of individuals who have faced such physical trauma and thrived through experiencing such adversity (e.g., a surfer who lost her arm in a shark attack, returning successfully as a professional surfer and spokesperson; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732313493673">Hamilton, 2010</xref>). Although researchers have spent considerable effort in understanding the negative effects of physical trauma, few have examined the processes that characterize people who have successfully adapted to such trauma.</p>
<p>Scholars have generally defined resilience as a positive adaptation to a traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732313493673">Luthar &amp; Cicchetti, 2000</xref>). As a part of the positive psychology movement, scholars proposed resilience theory as a solution-based (vs. problem-based) approach to understanding positive adaptations to traumatic events. The concept of resilience emerged to “explain how some individuals maintain healthy lifestyles and become even more capable in spite of facing similar adversities, stressors, or life changes that result in maladaptation to [a] life event among non-resilient people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313493673">Richardson, Neiger, Jensen, &amp; Kumpfer, 1990</xref>, p. 33). Examples of resilience inquiry include studies of resilient children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313493673">Luthar, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732313493673">Werner, 1986</xref>), cancer survivors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313493673">Thornton &amp; Perez, 2006</xref>), burn survivors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732313493673">Lau &amp; van Niekerk, 2011</xref>), individuals with HIV/AIDS (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732313493673">Bletzer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732313493673">Milam, 2006</xref>), and survivors of child maltreatment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313493673">Hall, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies of adversity have included injury or disease that resulted in physical disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313493673">Salick &amp; Auerbach, 2006</xref>). However, there is still a need for a full examination of the resilience experiences of individuals who have endured adversity in overcoming traumatic injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732313493673">White, Driver, &amp; Warren, 2008</xref>). Thus, the aim of our study was to investigate the process in which individuals adapt to the loss of physical ability.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732313493673">
<title>The Resiliency Model</title>
<p>To examine resilience experienced by individuals who have acquired physical disability, we have adopted Richardson and colleagues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313493673">Richardson et al., 1990</xref>) Resiliency Model. According to Richardson and colleagues, the process of acquiring resilient qualities begins with “biopsychospiritual homeostasis.” In this state, individuals are in a comfort zone characterized by an “adapted state of mind, body, and spirit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson, 2002</xref>, p. 311). Although life stressors and changes continuously affect individuals, individuals utilize resilient qualities they have developed through previous disruptions to cope with these stressors and maintain homeostasis. However, unprotected life events can disrupt this balance. Unprotected life events are those that individuals have not experienced, or events that they have experienced but for which did not gain the necessary growth to adapt to the same or similar event in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Richardson and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313493673">Richardson et al., 1990</xref>) posited that disruptions interact with individuals’ resilient qualities (i.e., “biopsychospiritual protective factors”) and envirosocial processes (e.g., support), and these interactions lead to one of four types of “reintegration.” According to the model, individuals can (a) reintegrate resiliently, (b) return to biopsychospiritual homeostasis, (c) reintegrate with loss, or (d) dysfunctionally reintegrate. First, resilient reintegration occurs when a disruption leads to personal growth and stronger resilient qualities for handling future adversity. Richardson and colleagues considered this form of reintegration the most adaptive outcome.</p>
<p>Second, individuals can return to biopsychospiritual homeostasis and fail to experience growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313493673">Richardson et al., 1990</xref>). In this form, individuals thus have no protection against the same or similar disruptions in the future. Third, individuals can experience reintegration with loss. This form of reintegration occurs when individuals lose some of their adaptive qualities (e.g., hope) because of the demands of the disruption. Finally, dysfunctional reintegration occurs when individuals engage in destructive behaviors (e.g., substance abuse) or other means to deal with life events. The particular type of reintegration that one experiences, as Richardson and colleagues noted, is “a function of individual skills and traits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313493673">Richardson et al., 1990</xref>, p. 37).</p>

<title>Three Waves of Resilience Inquiry</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson (2002)</xref> identified three layers or “waves” of resilience inquiry. The first wave of inquiry relates to the identification of resilient qualities that support individuals to positively adapt in the face of the adversity. The second is the study of the resilience process and how individuals acquire the skills and abilities to successfully adapt to adversity. The Resiliency Model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson and colleagues (2002</xref>; 1990) is a representation of the second wave of inquiry. The aim of the third wave of inquiry is to identify motivation sources within individuals that drive them toward resilient reintegration. Thus, scholars who adopt this line of inquiry attempt to answer the question, “What and where is the energy source or motivation to reintegrate resiliently?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson, 2002</xref>, p. 313). Richardson identified such motivation or energy sources as “innate resilience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson, 2002</xref>, p. 308).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson (2002)</xref> claimed that resilience researchers mostly have focused on the first wave of inquiry and identifying characteristics that support individuals to thrive in adversity. Indeed, within the context of recovery from traumatic injuries or living with disabilities, researchers have identified a variety of resilient qualities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313493673">Bonetti &amp; Johnston, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313493673">Duvdevany &amp; Rimmerman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732313493673">Lysaght &amp; Larmour-Trode, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313493673">Salick &amp; Auerbach, 2006</xref>). Such factors include internal locus of control (Duvdevany &amp; Rimmerman), possessing high self-efficacy (Bonetti &amp; Johnston), and receiving social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732313493673">Devereux, Bullock, Bargmann-Losche, &amp; Kyriakou, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732313493673">King et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313493673">Ruddell &amp; Shinew, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although some researchers have examined similar constructs and processes, such as five stages of trauma and recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313493673">Salick &amp; Aurbach, 2006</xref>) and psychological recovery from traumatic amputations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313493673">Ferguson, Richie, &amp; Gomez, 2004</xref>), few researchers have examined the second wave of inquiry, the resilience process, particularly in the context of recovery from traumatic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732313493673">White et al., 2008</xref>). Examining how individuals adapt and resiliently reintegrate following traumatic events (i.e., the second wave of inquiry) could provide significant implications for the theory on the development of resilient qualities, as well as practical implications for rehabilitation and caregivers of people with physical disabilities.</p>

<sec id="section3-1049732313493673">
<title>The Role of Sport in the Resilience Process</title>
<p>As part of rehabilitation programs, medical professionals have been utilizing sport as an effective treatment for individuals who endured traumatic injuries. For example, the ongoing efforts of the U. S. Wounded Warrior Project include the promotion of physical and psychological health of veterans through sport participation. The Wounded Warrior Project run various year-long sport programs for wounded veterans and assists their recovery and regaining of independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732313493673">Wounded Warrior Project, 2011</xref>). Anecdotal evidence from sport participants and their families and coaches, as well as past research in the area, support the positive role of sports in their recovery. Empirical studies have demonstrated the positive effects of physical activity, sport, or exercise participation not only on physical health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732313493673">Jones, Legge, &amp; Goulding, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732313493673">Nash, 2005</xref>), but also on the psychological health of individuals with physical disabilities, including improved management of mood problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313493673">Graham et al., 2008</xref>), reduced stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732313493673">Latimer, Martin Ginis, Hicks, &amp; McCartney, 2004</xref>), and decreased depression and anxiety symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313493673">Hicks et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although previous study findings showed the physical and mental health benefits of sport for individuals with disabilities, there is little understanding of how sports have effects on their psychological adaptation to disabilities. Understanding how and why sports have positive effects on the psychological adaption of individuals who have endured trauma could benefit efforts, such as the Wounded Worrier Project, in improving the interventions and sport programs to best assist participants’ rehabilitation. Thus, in addition to examining the resilience process of those who have experienced trauma that resulted in physical disability, we examined the role of sport participation in the resilience process using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson and colleagues’ (2002</xref>; 1990) Resiliency Model as a guiding theoretical framework.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>The main purposes of our study were to gain in-depth understanding of experiences of individuals who faced trauma which resulted in spinal cord injury (SCI) and how sport influenced their experiences. We conducted the study within the phenomenological paradigm, aiming to understand the human world by examining subjective realities reflected in people’s meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732313493673">Patton, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>We utilized purposive sampling; that is, we selected participants based on adequacy and appropriateness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732313493673">Patton, 2002</xref>). In this study, we focused on individuals with SCI. SCI is “the occurrence of an acute traumatic lesion of neural elements in the spinal canal (spinal cord and cauda equina), resulting in temporary or permanent sensory and/or motor deficit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313493673">National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, 2011</xref>, para.1). SCI is one of the most common injuries and acquired disabilities in the United States. There are about 273,000 Americans with SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732313493673">National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, 2013</xref>). Generally, SCI results in loss of sensation or motor functioning, although the physical function after injury largely depends on what type and level of SCI the individual acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732313493673">National Spinal Cord Injury Association, 2011</xref>). We thought that these individuals would provide the insight into both of our main research questions.</p>
<p>We recruited participants at a wheelchair rugby tournament and conducted interviews at the tournament site or the hotel rooms of participants. The sample included 12 men with SCI (quadriplegia, C5 to C7, complete and incomplete injuries), aged 21 to 41 years, who participated in competitive wheelchair rugby (range of 1 to 18 years of experience). We collected data through in-depth semistructured interviews<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732313493673">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732313493673">Kvale, 1996</xref>). We followed an interview guide but had the flexibility to ask additional probing questions if necessary.</p>
<p>Prior to the start of the study, we obtained approval from the university’s institutional review board. Following our explanation of the general study purpose, each participant signed a consent form, which assured him of the voluntary nature of his participation, the confidentiality of his responses, and his rights as a human subject. We began each interview with questions about demographic and background information. We then asked rapport-building questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732313493673">Kvale, 1996</xref>) followed by the statement of purpose for the research. The main interview started with the question, “Tell me about the experience of losing your physical ability.” We structured questions around three main areas of interest: (a) the adversity experience (traumatic accident which resulted in SCI), including affect, behaviors, and cognitions experienced at the time of injury; (b) a description of the resilience process, including coping strategies and social interactions; and (c) factors perceived to be important or debilitating in coping with the accident and losing physical functions.</p>
<p>Prior to the start of data collection, each of us conducted two pilot interviews with participants in disability sports to evaluate the interview protocol, make the necessary changes to the interview guide and protocol, and practice interviewing skills and field note taking. At the tournament, and before collecting data, we observed several practice sessions and games and took field notes to help develop awareness for the demands and culture of the sport, and norms for this particular social group.</p>
<p>We conducted interviews at locations chosen by participants—either at the tournament site or in the hotel rooms of participants. Also, to help participants feel comfortable, we provided a bottle of water (or soda or sports drink) and snacks during the interview. Interviews lasted between 40 and 90 minutes, and we reached data saturation after interviews with 12 participants. We digitally recorded the interviews and took field notes about observations during the interviews. We have omitted the participants’ names and any potentially identifying information from this article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732313493673">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We utilized a modified form of analytic induction to analyze the data. We examined data for the emergence of undiscovered patterns and understanding, but still considered their relations to the Resiliency Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313493673">Richardson et al., 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732313493673">Patton (2002)</xref> described this approach as “a strategy for engaging in qualitative inquiry and comparative case analysis that includes examining preconceived hypotheses, that is, without the pretence of the mental blank slate advocated in purer forms of phenomenological inquiry and grounded theory” (p. 493). Interviews were transcribed verbatim by professional transcribers. We checked the transcripts against the original audio recording prior to data analysis. The interviews produced 207 pages of transcripts. We performed second readings of the interviews to become familiar with the transcript contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732313493673">Moustakas, 1994</xref>). Then, we created tags of meaning units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732313493673">Tesch, 1990</xref>). A meaning unit is “a segment of text that is comprehensible by itself and contains one idea, episode or piece of information that is instrumental to the research questions” (Tesch, p.116). The analysis produced a total of 883 meaning units.</p>
<p>We gathered tags with similar meanings together and created the categories. Then, we created a final schematic representation or “map” of each participant’s interview after the completion of the analysis for every interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732313493673">Galli &amp; Vealey, 2008</xref>). These maps represented our observation of each participant’s resilience experiences after the injury. In the final stage of analysis, we searched for the commonalities among themes from all interviews with the goal of integrating and synthesizing similar meaning units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732313493673">Kvale, 1996</xref>). We examined commonalities in the interaction of themes that emerged in each interview and in the timing of these emerged themes across participants’ experiences. We then compared the themes and drew connections between them to construct a model (an overall map) that explained participants’ experiences and actions (Galli &amp; Vealey).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732313493673">
<title>Trustworthiness</title>
<p>The first and second authors performed reliability checks. First, each of us independently tagged meaning units and coded the transcripts. We convened after coding each transcript to compare and discuss differences until we reached consensus. Second, we grouped meaning units into themes, one transcript at a time, and met to compare and discuss, just as with meaning units. In comparing the analyses, we covered both the content of the themes and the interpretations of their meaning. Finally, a third individual (not the third author), who was not familiar with the participants, provided additional feedback. The third individual put a random sample of meaning units into categories we provided. We then checked for agreement between our observation and that of the third individual. In a case of major discrepancy, we reevaluated our analyses. We also completed member checks. We emailed the entire interview transcript,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049732313493673">2</xref></sup> a list of meaning units, and the map of the respective interview to each participant. We asked the participants to carefully evaluate the results described in these documents against their perceptions of experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732313493673">Cresswell &amp; Miller, 2000</xref>). We did not make any amendments after member checking because none of the participants indicated dissatisfaction with our presentation of analyses.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732313493673" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The analysis yielded seven general categories, which we used to organize the information regarding the process of overcoming adversity and developing resilient qualities. These categories include the following: (a) pre-existing factors and experiences, (b) disturbance/disturbing emotions, (c) multiple sources and types of support, (d) special opportunities and experiences, (e) various behavioral and cognitive coping strategies, (f) motivation to adapt, and (g) gains from the resilience process. We also conducted a secondary analysis across these categories to identify parts of the resilience process where sport participation played a role. We present the overall model of resilience after traumatic injury in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732313493673">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Pre-Existing Factors and Experiences</title>
<p>The results from our study suggest that pre-existing factors (qualities that individuals possessed before the adversity) and pre-adversity experiences interacted with participants’ resilience process. Participants reported that events experienced before injury might have affected how they coped with their adversity. These events included family adversities (e.g., divorce of parents, death of family members, growing up with only one parent), independent experiences (e.g., taking care of siblings), and sport/competitive experiences. However, some participants discussed that they had never experienced adversity as significant as their injury. Many also reported that the positive social environment they were in pre-injury, such as good parenting (e.g., learning “work ethics” from a father) and having good role models (e.g., sport coaches), influenced their strategies for coping with adversity. In addition, important lessons learned from role models brought a drive and motivation to cope with adversity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, participants described various personal attributes that influenced how they responded to their adversity. They discussed positive attributes that assisted in their resilience process, such as competitiveness, industriousness, flexibility with failures, openness to challenges, focus on the present, a balanced personality, a positive attitude, a leadership personality, spiritual faith, and an independent mindset. Negative attributes that participants identified included pessimism, stubbornness, fear of failure, and introversion. Participants described these negative attributes as characteristics that adversely affected the progress of their recovery from the trauma.</p>

<title>Disturbance</title>
<p>Participants indicated that the time immediately following their accident was generally a time of great “disturbance.” This seemed to come in many different forms, namely, disturbing emotions, disturbing thoughts, and challenges. These were both immediate reactions to the accident and the persistent or recurrent feelings and thoughts they had experienced after the trauma, even after they had gone through rehabilitation and gained some mobility. Disturbing emotions included loneliness, shock, numbness, guilt, and depression, as well as denial about the injury and the fact that they would not walk again. Such emotions also included fear, such as fear of rejection and fear of immobility.</p>
<p>In addition, feeling uncertain about the future was a theme that appeared across a few participants. For example, one participant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>You realize you are not gonna walk again. You know, you are not sure of the future. You might not be able to get a job, not really have a girlfriend, or get married. Or you might not get to do all this and that. So it’s very uncertain times. So you don’t know.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many participants also experienced frustration. One participant described his persistent feelings of frustration and the shock he experienced after the injury:
<disp-quote>
<p>With the impact of everything, I was kinda incoherent at first. And then, over time, I was really astonished because I could really do nothing. I couldn’t move myself out of bed. I mean, people had to help turn me and stuff, and move me, put me in my chair, out my chair. . . . So I got flustered a little bit.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Disturbing thoughts also appeared as a consistent theme across participants. They mentioned several thoughts about what would have been if they had not been injured. One participant mentioned that after the accident he repeatedly asked himself, “Why’d this happened to me? What did I do to deserve this?” Having a thought such as “Why me?” was a common theme across participants. Also, participants experienced a variety of challenges, including struggles with changes (e.g., activities of daily living, basic functioning) and regaining independence. One participant described his social struggles after the injury:
<disp-quote>
<p>I mean it, [going back to high school] was very awkward. I mean very . . . I felt out of place. I didn’t feel like I should be there. I felt like everybody was staring at me. I didn’t know how to act. I didn’t know how to interact with people. I didn’t even know how to interact with my friends that have been my friends my whole life. . . . They didn’t know what to say to me, and I kind of didn’t know what to say to them. So it’s kind of very uneasy for a while.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As this participant described, being in a wheelchair brought a change to his relationship with others, and he struggled to adjust.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732313493673">
<title>Multiple Sources and Types of Support</title>
<p>The importance of support was a consistent theme across all participants in the study, with many participants identifying it as one of the most important factors in coping with challenges and bouncing back from adversity. Participants received support from multiple sources, including family (i.e., parents, spouse, siblings), significant others, rehabilitation professionals, other people with disabilities, friends, coworkers, and teammates and coaches on the wheelchair rugby team. Support was instrumental in their resilience process. Participants also described the importance of meeting with people with similar disabilities, which became possible through participating on the rugby team or within other settings such as a support group or rehabilitation program. Support from others who had similar disabilities appeared to be critical for participants in adapting to their disabilities.</p>
<p>Participants received support in many different forms, including physical support (e.g., assistance in daily functioning) as well as emotional and moral support from others. They discussed the importance of feeling accepted for who they were, feeling understood, and not receiving different treatment because of their disabilities. Another form of support that was particularly helpful was straight talk (when others took care not to “sugarcoat” things and spoke honestly about participants’ current state)—a mix of “tough love” and being challenged to improve and develop. One participant described the challenge support he received from his mother:
<disp-quote>
<p>One method she used for me to learn how to dress myself was she would pick clothes that didn’t match. And trust me, I would get mad, so then I was like, I would do it myself and I started doing it myself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For these participants to resiliently reintegrate, the extra push to adapt to challenges was critical.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732313493673">
<title>Special Opportunities and Significant Experiences</title>
<p>Participants mentioned a variety of special opportunities and experiences that were important in the process of reintegration. Special opportunities and significant experiences identified by participants included playing sports and achievement experiences in sports and other contexts, such as education. Participants also expressed their appreciation for experiences that allowed them to be competitive, exert themselves, take out frustrations, and provide an outlet for or distraction from disturbing thoughts and emotions. They discussed having independent experiences (e.g., living on their own, travel) and access to resources (e.g., sport facilities). They also described that experiences that made them feel “normal” were important:
<disp-quote>
<p>After I became independent, and we got pregnant, the child thing [happened]. It’s like, “Gosh! Shit, I can do anything anybody else can do. I’m living. I’m still alive.” So that was the switch. That was the switch and that made a big difference mentally.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many participants reported social interactions and vicarious experiences, especially through people with similar disabilities, as crucial experiences that helped them grow:
<disp-quote>
<p>Guys with, you know, more severe injuries, especially, you know, these guys with more like C-three to C-six, and seeing how they, you know, go through life, [helped me]. And a lot of them are independent or semi-independent, and then they drive and eat and stuff, and just get out. I mean, that was a really positive experience, seeing that. And I was thinking then, “If these guys can do it, what am I whining about?” You know? Here, I can do a lot more that they can’t, so it’s just ridiculous.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For these participants, seeing others with more severe injuries who successfully adapted and were independent seemed to be important in making them realize that they needed to change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732313493673">
<title>Various Behavioral and Cognitive Coping Strategies</title>
<p>Participants described various behavioral and cognitive strategies they had utilized in their resilience process to cope with disruptive thoughts, emotions, and struggles. One participant noted that one of his major coping strategies was to think of this adversity as a challenge. He said, “I don’t see it [his injury] as a ‘You’re fucked. Give up. Go shoot yourself. Go live in a nursing home.’ I see it as a challenge.” Having this challenge mindset toward the disability was instrumental in coping with his adversity.</p>
<p>Participants also discussed goal setting as an effective behavioral coping strategy. Setting life goals and focusing on daily improvement seemed to aid in the process. One participant noted, “I myself just kind of threw myself in the therapy, physical therapy after I got injured, and concentrated on that, concentrated on getting better.” Another participant described his strategy to deal with the discomfort he experienced in a social situation into which he forced himself:
<disp-quote>
<p>Hang out with your friends and go to parties, or go out in the public, be seen in public. [These helped me deal with the discomfort]. You know, it took me a while. I didn’t like going out in public at first. I felt out of place . . . I felt like everybody’s staring at me and I didn’t wanna be there . . . but the more I did it, the more it helped, and eventually I became used to it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A few participants also expressed that having faith and spirituality was important in making sense of their experiences and the adversity they had experienced:
<disp-quote>
<p>I mean, I grew up going to church and things like that, but I never really committed myself to it. So I know I just went because my mom made me or whatever. . . . After my, even after my accident, I just felt little. [pause] Preachers or stuff come to hospital and I didn’t want to talk to him. . . . But once [pause] I started going back to, you know, going to church stuff, and that made a big difference, you know? I just turn my life over out there to Christ. It made a big difference to me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All participants discussed using various coping strategies to manage disturbing thoughts, emotions, and struggles, and they mentioned having successfully utilized these strategies. Nonetheless, the process of experiencing and coping with these disturbances did not come in a sequential fashion. It seemed to be a long-lasting process wherein participants simultaneously struggled and figured out ways of coping.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732313493673">
<title>Motivation to Adapt</title>
<p>Participants identified the importance of motivation to adapt, its sources, and realization of the need to adapt in their resilience process. Sources of motivation to adapt included pressure to appear strong in a context of social situations with others, independence and avoiding being dependent on others, life goals, and family (i.e., feeling the need to change for their children or spouse). Also, many participants indicated there was a point in the process when they realized they needed to change, although the timing and causes of these “turning points” seemed to differ among participants. For one participant, it was family that made him realize he needed to change. After his accident, his relationship with his family suffered:
<disp-quote>
<p>I knew something had to change. I still loved them, you know. I loved them more, you know, with all my heart. And just, you know, [pause] deep down, I know I didn’t wanna get rid of them. I didn’t wanna have a divorce and stuff, so I finally just manned up and said, “All right, I got to deal with this.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732313493673">
<title>Gains From the Resilience Process</title>
<p>Participants indicated that their respective accident did not change who they were; that is, they believed their personality had not changed because of this experience. However, all participants indicated that they had gained and learned new skills and perspectives after the injury. Many participants mentioned having gained a more positive outlook on life and adversity. For example, one participant said, “I look on the bright side of things. I would say I am more optimistic. . . . I see the glass is half full and not half empty.”</p>
<p>Many participants also described the positive changes in their social relations after the injury. One participant indicated he started to open up to others after the injury:
<disp-quote>
<p>You know, [a big change after the injury was to] let people in my life, that I didn’t for the longest time. So overall, I’d say, I know I drove some people away. I hurt some people’s feelings. You know, I mean, by being bitter at them. But, overall, I’d say, yes, it’s been a big change.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants reported changes in personal qualities. Many indicated that they became generally more confident, and especially more confident about their ability to bounce back from adversities than they were before injury. They felt prepared to face adversities in life because of this experience:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have more confidence in myself coming back, if, you know, if I got sick and say I got cancer or something, I would know that I could . . . I would have faith in myself or confidence in myself that I would be able to get better and heal myself . . . or just overcome that also.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some participants indicated that they had gained self-regulation skills. One participant described how he learned to be patient in the process of recovering from the trauma:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have become a little more patient. [laughing] I guess your patience gets you better, being in a wheelchair. I try not to get angry over little things, or even anything. Things happen; just flow with it. I guess that is what I always say: “Can’t do anything about it. Just go with it, and make the best of it.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many participants also indicated that they had become independent and resourceful. They had adapted to their disabilities and lived independent lives. One participant mentioned that he felt even more independent than he was before the injury:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’d say I am more independent. . . . You wouldn’t think that, because I’m actually, I’m really more dependent on other people sometimes. You know, if I need to carry something that is fifty pound, then I need somebody to do it for me. But in many ways this made me want to do more things for myself. If I can do something, I wanna do it for myself rather than have somebody else do it. So you know, if I can pick something up from [the] floor, I would rather do it myself than have [to] ask somebody to do it for me. So I’ve become more independent.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section16-1049732313493673">
<title>The Roles of Sport in the Resilience Process</title>
<p>As a secondary analysis, we identified parts of the resilience process in which sport participation played a role. All participants indicated that sport was a significant part of their resilience process and something that had turned their lives around. There were two main roles sport played in these individuals’ resilience processes. First, we observed that participants’ critical sources of social support and social interactions were their teammates. Sport served as a place where they interacted with individuals who had gone through or were going through similar postinjury experiences:
<disp-quote>
<p>I got involved with rugby, being with other people with similar disabilities and becoming friends, a new base of friends. . . . I built a larger base of friends now. You know, as a person with disability, I have got so many friends. It’s unbelievable, you know. So it’s like I’ve added a new family in my life.</p>
<p>It’s nice to get out and hang around with the guys, you know, in chairs, and talk about different stuff. You know, problems and how to get over things. So it has been a real out and open opportunity. I think, you know, besides . . . the physical aspect of getting in better shape, and just mentally, you know, talking with all other guys and their problems and how they deal with stuff [helped me to adapt to disability].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to gaining physical benefits, for these participants sport was a place where they interacted with mentors and peers. They indicated that such interactions assisted them in dealing with challenges and adapting to their disabilities.</p>
<p>Second, sports seemed to provide unique opportunities and experiences that influenced the resilience process of these participants. Many indicated that sports provided them with achievement experiences that increased their confidence. One participant said, “It helps you get your confidence back, because you know, you are playing the sport and you are seeing you are getting better at the sport. So then it rolls over into daily life.” He believed that the achievement and accomplishments he experienced in sports and the confidence he gained transferred to life outside sports.</p>
<p>Participants expressed that sports provided a sense of normality in their lives. Most (11) had experience playing sports before the injury. One participant said, “It’s the most normal thing I do.” Playing sports helped these participants to realize that they could still be active and competitive with their acquired disabilities. Sports also served as an outlet for their emotions. Many participants mentioned that sports gave them opportunities to exert themselves and distracted them from disturbing emotions and thoughts. One noted, “I’ve been able to take some aggression out here on the court.”</p>
<p>In addition, sports gave the participants opportunities to learn and practice coping skills. They mentioned that sports helped them to have a more positive attitude and perspective about life, to learn to self-motivate, and to persevere. One participant expressed that through sport he learned discipline, or ways to set goals and focus on what was necessary, which helped him adapt to his disability:
<disp-quote>
<p>The thing with sport is there’s discipline. You know, no matter what sport, there’s discipline. And looking back now, maybe that was what kept me in line and focused, is looking at it as, “Okay, today I want to be able to push half way around the block by myself or without stopping and resting.” And then, the next day, “I want to go further.” And, you know, just challenging yourself and just being disciplined enough to where I wouldn’t ask for help, no more, when I need it.</p>

<sec id="section17-1049732313493673" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we examined psychological resilience experienced by sport participants with SCI utilizing the Resiliency Model by Richardson and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493673">Richardson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313493673">Richardson et al., 1990</xref>) as a guiding framework. We also investigated the unique role of sport participation in their resilience processes. Consistent with the Resiliency Model, our findings suggest that resilience among individuals with physical disabilities is a multifactorial process. These factors included qualities that individuals possessed before the adversity; various types and sources of social support; special opportunities and experiences; various behavioral and cognitive coping strategies; motivation to adapt to changes; and learned attributes.</p>
<p>To extend understanding of recovery from medical trauma (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313493673">Salick &amp; Auerbach, 2006</xref>), the results from our study indicate that individuals’ resilience processes after traumatic injury do not come in a specific orderly fashion or in predictable stages. Rather, the resilience process experienced by these individuals was a complex, interactive process. This understanding of resilience is consistent with the past resilience research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732313493673">Galli &amp; Vealey, 2008</xref>; Salick &amp; Auerbach). We also observed that pre-existing personality or personal factors were important but were not the sole determinants of the resilience outcome. The interactions between these personal factors and other factors in the process were most characteristic of resilient reintegration.</p>
<p>In this study we also identified the role of sport participation in the resilience process, especially its role in providing social support, opportunities, and experiences—particularly achievement experiences. Past research has demonstrated that family, peer groups, school, and community are the most important socializing agents in the lives of individuals with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732313493673">Devereux et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732313493673">King et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313493673">Ruddell &amp; Shinew, 2006</xref>). Research on disability sport also has consistently shown that sport experiences could provide significant social support to individuals with disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732313493673">Anderson, Wozencroft, &amp; Bedini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313493673">Graham et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study extends past findings and shows that sport provides significant social opportunities that assist the resilience process of individuals who face traumatic injuries. The participants indicated that their teammates were a critical source of several types of support, helping them adapt and reintegrate from their injury. Meeting and spending time with teammates who were dealing with or had dealt with similar adversities eliminated fear, anxiety, and feelings of uncertainty, and gave participants a sense of belonging, confidence, and motivation to adapt. Through sports, vicarious learning also took place; participants learned life tactics, coping skills, and attitudes from these peers and mentors.</p>
<p>Sport also provided other special opportunities and experiences that facilitated the resilience process. For example, many participants experienced achievement through sport (learning new skills, winning, being selected for a national team), which gave them feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction. They reported that sport accomplishments increased their confidence in their physical abilities, and that this confidence transferred to life outside sport. Also, sport was a place for exerting and diverting any negative emotions and energy. They released disturbing thoughts and emotions by exerting themselves in physical activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049732313493673">
<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>Although our study provides insight into the resilience process experienced by individuals with acquired disabilities, future studies should aim to gain more comprehensive understanding about each component in the process. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313493673">Rosenfeld and Richman (1997)</xref> identified eight forms of social support, including listening support, emotional support, emotional challenge, reality confirmation support, task appreciation support, task challenge support, tangible assistance support, and personal assistance. Although it was not our primary focus, our study showed the importance of social support in the resilience process, and results indicate that this support came in many forms and from multiple sources. Future studies should focus on and investigate these different forms of support and their effects on individuals who are in the process of adapting to their disabilities.</p>
<p>There is also a need for examination of the experiences of individuals who encounter different reintegration outcomes after injury. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313493673">Richardson et al. (1990)</xref>, there are four types of reintegration outcomes: individuals can (a) reintegrate resiliently, (b) return to biopsychospiritual homeostasis, (c) reintegrate with loss, or (d) dysfunctionally reintegrate. We sought to purposely select participants who had resiliently reintegrated by becoming involved in sports. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732313493673">Galli and Vealey (2008)</xref> suggested, examining participants who have experienced different reintegration outcomes and investigating their experiences in the process should contribute to our understanding of resilience and the unique factors that lead to different outcomes.</p>
<p>In addition, scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313493673">Ferguson et al., 2004</xref>) have suggested that recovery from an injury might “occur both at the macro (i.e., societal, community) and micro level (i.e., individual, family)” (p. 937). Although we attempted to gain a deeper understanding of the process of individuals’ resilience, we did not fully examine the resilience process at different levels. Previous research findings suggest that family members of individuals with acquired disabilities also experience hardship, and they, also, need to adjust to a different way of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313493673">Duvdevany, Buchbinder, &amp; Yaacov, 2008</xref>). Researchers should consider investigating the effects such trauma has on family members, how they adapt to the changes, and how the family’s resilience processes interact with the individual’s resilience process.</p>
<p>In this article we have shown the unique role of sports in the resilience process of individuals with acquired disability. However, it is important to note that most of the participants in our study (<italic>n</italic> = 11) had experience playing sports preinjury, although competitive levels varied. This previous experience might have influenced sport experiences postinjury. For example, it is possible that it was easier for the experienced sports participants to make decisions to participate in sports programs after injury, and the impact of sports on their resilience might have been greater (or lesser) as compared with individuals with no past sports experience. For future studies, researchers should investigate the effects of sport participation on individuals who have not played sports prior to injury.</p>
<p>In addition, our study included only those who participated in wheelchair rugby. Individual sports and team sports might provide different experiences to individuals with disabilities. Furthermore, engagement in other activities (e.g., music, art) might also provide similar experiences to those offered in sports. Researchers might compare the experiences of those with disabilities who participate in sports and those who choose to participate in different activities.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Previous studies have identified characteristics that could assist individuals in successfully adapting to trauma that resulted in physical disability. Our study extends the literature on resilience experienced by individuals with physical disability by examining the process of resilience and the factors involved. In addition, our study shows the significant role sports could play in the lives of individuals who endured physical trauma.</p>
<p>Physical therapy and rehabilitation professionals have long employed sports as an effective tool for physical as well as psychological recovery for those individuals who have endured trauma that resulted in long-term disabilities. Although previous studies have established the health benefits of sports and physical activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313493673">Graham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313493673">Hicks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732313493673">Latimer et al., 2004</xref>), there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the mechanisms through which sports participation has therapeutic effects on individuals’ psychological recovery. As our study suggests, sports could provide unique experiences to individuals with disabilities, and could be a sustainable means of keeping individuals with disabilities physically active and assisting them in the psychosocial recovery process.</p>
