<abstract>
<p>Journalists condemn plagiarism, yet rarely acknowledge disagreements over attribution standards. To document and evaluate those differences, journalists in broadcasting and print operations were surveyed (<italic>N</italic> = 953). Respondents were far less willing to attribute press releases than they were their colleagues’ work. They were more likely to consider attribution optional if they were under pressure to produce, worked for a broadcast medium, were a content creator, were less experienced, or saw their principles as flexible. The findings reveal that attribution beliefs are far more pliant than ethics policies suggest and illuminate some of the reasons why plagiarism occurs.</p>

<p>In August 2011, the <italic>Washington Post</italic> Outlook section published a guest opinion piece by a former software company recruiter, Anna Lewis, about the paucity of women in the computing industry. She began her piece with quotations from a 1967 <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic> story and offered statistics about the historical prevalence of women in the field. The piece did not attribute the primary source for that information: a University of Texas professor, Nathan Ensmenger, who spent years tracking down a clean copy of the magazine via eBay and who researches the history of technology. Ensmenger’s colleagues recognized his unattributed work and called it to his attention. The professor told <italic>Post</italic> ombudsman Patrick B. Pexton the Outlook essay was so poorly attributed that, had it been submitted as a classroom assignment, he would have given it a failing grade and referred it to his university’s academic dishonesty board. The Outlook section editor who solicited and handled Lewis’s essay defended the omission of attribution as standard practice—although she conceded that she would include a citation if she were doing it all over. Pexton ruled the essay omitted important attribution, yet didn’t plagiarize.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012468743">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The incongruous response of the Outlook section editor and the ombudsman’s false dichotomy illustrate that attribution—and thus plagiarism—is contested terrain. Clearly, not all information cited by a journalist requires attribution; commonly understood facts, or what might be considered “public domain” information, don’t demand sourcing. But Pexton’s declaration, that the piece lacked attribution yet wasn’t plagiarism, ignores the reality that Lewis was entirely reliant on another person’s work for the facts cited, and her failure to attribute her source constitutes plagiarism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012468743">2</xref></sup> Journalistic plagiarism is a failure to attribute. And yet, while journalists condemn plagiarism, they disagree over which information must be attributed. As the <italic>New York Times</italic> public editor said in a situation similar to the <italic>Washington Post</italic> Outlook episode, “It simply isn’t clear how much attribution is enough.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012468743">3</xref></sup> Journalists disagree on whether they must cite a press release as a source of information<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012468743">4</xref></sup> or when uniquely obtained information becomes common knowledge and is thus exempt from attribution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012468743">5</xref></sup> And they disagree whether to attribute information they take from each other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012468743">6</xref></sup> In short, professionals endorse the pithy “never plagiarize” proscription of the Society of Professional Journalists ethics code without putting skin and bones on that skeletal motto.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012468743">7</xref></sup> Variances in attribution practice are at the heart of many plagiarism cases,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012468743">8</xref></sup> yet little research has been published exploring those distinctions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to survey professional journalists to evaluate attribution beliefs and uncover the roots of plagiarism.</p>
<p>This study is grounded in the theoretical primacy of autonomy in professional ideology. Acting independently is one of four sections in the SPJ ethics code,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012468743">9</xref></sup> and exercising personal conscience is one of Kovach and Rosenstiel’s ten elements of journalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012468743">10</xref></sup> Some argue from a libertarian perspective that journalists must have freedom to exercise their craft,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012468743">11</xref></sup> while others have noted that autonomy is a central element in the sociological construct of professionalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012468743">12</xref></sup> A few have acknowledged flaws in the execution of autonomy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012468743">13</xref></sup> or conceded it to be the “unindicted co-conspirator” in newsroom scandals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012468743">14</xref></sup> Still, freedom to choose is a necessary condition for ethical decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012468743">15</xref></sup> At least 80% of reporters said they have considerable autonomy in choosing stories and emphases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012468743">16</xref></sup> A long-term study of a failed effort to introduce teams into a newsroom environment concluded a primary cause was the unwillingness of journalists to relinquish independence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012468743">17</xref></sup> A six-week study of a newsroom found that journalists frequently cited autonomy as central to their self-image and job satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012468743">18</xref></sup> Autonomy is one of five “ideal-typical values” of journalistic ideology<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012468743">19</xref></sup> and is so taken for granted that journalists interviewed for an ethics study rarely invoked the idea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012468743">20</xref></sup> In fact, journalism ethics can be construed as serving to support autonomy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012468743">21</xref></sup> The primacy of journalistic autonomy, especially in the light of ethical relativism, theoretically presupposes variance in attribution beliefs. Whether autonomy norms flow from Enlightenment notions of individual determinism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012468743">22</xref></sup> or are shaped by the moral ecology of a newsroom,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077699012468743">23</xref></sup> the exalted position given independence predicts that journalists will hold a flexible view of attribution.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Normative journalism condemns plagiarism and extols attribution. The <italic>Washington Post</italic> ethics code declares that all material derived from other media must be attributed because “plagiarism is one of journalism’s unforgivable sins.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012468743">24</xref></sup> A reporting textbook defines plagiarism as “the most loathsome, most shameful” of journalistic transgressions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012468743">25</xref></sup> Plagiarism is prohibited by ethics codes for the Radio Television Digital News Association,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012468743">26</xref></sup> Society for News Design,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012468743">27</xref></sup> Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012468743">28</xref></sup> and bloggers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012468743">29</xref></sup> Attribution allows readers to trace a story to its source<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012468743">30</xref></sup> and advances objectivity norms by distancing the reporter from the information cited.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012468743">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prohibitions against plagiarism apparently do not bar journalists from recycling each other’s sources. <italic>Columbia Journalism Review</italic> documented in 2011 how Brian Condra of Ireland was such a good quote that journalists interviewed him about twenty times in two years as an exemplar for a typical person stung by the recession—showing that while journalists did their own work, they saw no problem in stealing the source.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012468743">32</xref></sup> Reporters have a tendency to “use the same sources who offer the same pithy quote or put the same spin on an issue.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012468743">33</xref></sup> Legacy media journalists who complain about “new media parasitism” ignore their own heavy reliance on their peers to identify sources they can reuse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012468743">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even when borrowing words, journalists disagree on when attribution is necessary. When repeating quotations, for example, journalists often assert the original source must be provided.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012468743">35</xref></sup> Yet practice differs. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina 2005, National Public Radio interviewed former First Lady Barbara Bush, who said the “underprivileged anyway” evacuees were well served by staying in the Astrodome.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012468743">36</xref></sup> Although the quotation was spoken in an exclusive radio interview, dozens of news organizations such as the <italic>Washington Post</italic> and <italic>New York Times</italic> repeated Bush’s words without attributing the radio source.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012468743">37</xref></sup> An internal <italic>Detroit Free Press</italic> investigation into the work of the paper’s prominent sports columnist, Mitch Albom, found several instances in which he had republished quotations without crediting the originating news organization. Sports editors backed Albom’s claim that attribution was optional as long as he accurately copied the quote—an assertion not found in any journalism textbook. The newspaper admitted its staffers were confused about attributing quotations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012468743">38</xref></sup> A <italic>New York Post</italic> reporter who copied quotes from the Associated Press without attribution to the wire service or to the originating newspaper, the <italic>Hartford Courant</italic>, said such cribbing was “pretty standard” in New York.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077699012468743">39</xref></sup> And the <italic>Courant</italic> systematically copied material from smaller Connecticut newspapers in 2009, often without attribution and sometimes crediting itself, until the victims cried foul.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077699012468743">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Newspapers are not the only medium for which attribution standards are ambiguous. Some broadcasting textbooks argue that attribution is just as important as it is for print and that it differs only in its placement: at the beginning of a sentence rather than the end.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077699012468743">41</xref></sup> Others disagree, saying that broadcasters should attribute less than their print colleagues to avoid interrupting a story’s flow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077699012468743">42</xref></sup> Another textbook declares that “statements don’t have to be attributed unless you have a reason.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077699012468743">43</xref></sup> Although the policy of the Associated Press is to attribute information derived from other journalists,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077699012468743">44</xref></sup> broadcasters “don’t usually attribute stories to wire services because, in a sense, they work for our news department.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077699012468743">45</xref></sup> An ethnographer studying broadcast outlets found that time-pressed staffers incorporated material from newspaper accounts into television reports without attribution. “Welcome to plagiarism news,” a videographer told him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077699012468743">46</xref></sup> Websites facilitate copy-and-paste borrowing. “The 900-pound gorilla facing news organizations distributing content over the Internet is the ever-present temptation to copy material from another Web site,” one textbook states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077699012468743">47</xref></sup> A study of how blogs influence news organizations found considerable variance in attribution, concluding, “Certainly, there are no universal attribution or editorial policies in place.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077699012468743">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>An example of a gap between attribution policy and praxis can be seen in how print and broadcast journalists treat press releases or video news releases. Only four of thirty-six organizational ethics codes collected by a newspaper association mentioned press releases, and all four said information from them should be credited.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077699012468743">49</xref></sup> Yet in the wake of layoffs decimating newsrooms, journalists increasingly use press releases as primary sources for stories, including reusing quotes without attribution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077699012468743">50</xref></sup> Similarly, the Radio Television Digital News Association calls for any third-party sources, such as video news releases, to be attributed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1077699012468743">51</xref></sup> However, one study showed that forty-eight of fifty-four video news releases aired had no hint of attribution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1077699012468743">52</xref></sup> Of television news directors, 30% said they rarely, if ever, identified the source of a video news release.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1077699012468743">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Attribution standards are not uniform across industrialized democracies. A study laboriously tracing the origins of stories produced over two weeks in 2006 found that five leading London dailies (<italic>The Guardian, The Independent, The Times, The Telegraph</italic>, and the <italic>Daily Mail</italic>) mainly or wholly relied on Press Association copy for 49% of the stories studied, yet credited the wire service in only 1% of the stories. So many stories were found to be copied from competing publications and from press releases, without attribution, that what appears to be common practice in England “would, elsewhere, be regarded as straightforward plagiarism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1077699012468743">54</xref></sup> A third of <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> stories examined in another study had been copied from other publications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1077699012468743">55</xref></sup> An examination of 1,603 articles at ten web sites in five nations (France, Germany, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States) found about 29% attributed the sources of information, a figure low enough to raise fears that “copy &amp; paste becomes the basic principle.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1077699012468743">56</xref></sup> Attribution is “a practice that is particular to U.S. journalism and not necessarily similar in other cultures.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1077699012468743">57</xref></sup> British newspapers treat unattributed copying as normal, but have discovered that “American newspapers apparently object to this practice and are therefore credited when material is lifted.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1077699012468743">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet even in the United States, attribution practices vary widely, in part because the standards are undefined. “Most newspapers have no rules,” concluded the Poynter Institute’s Roy Peter Clark after evaluating how journalists used unattributed information from wire services, press releases, and other media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1077699012468743">59</xref></sup> In a review of twenty plagiarism cases, a <italic>Columbia Journalism Review</italic> author noted that a contributing factor is a lack of journalistic consensus regarding when attribution is required.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1077699012468743">60</xref></sup> “Definitions can be blurry,” wrote media critic David Shaw.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1077699012468743">61</xref></sup> Bob Giles, a former newspaper editor who wrote a book about newsroom management, urged colleagues to commit attribution policies to writing because “if every newsroom had clearly articulated standards, you’d have fewer cases of plagiarism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1077699012468743">62</xref></sup> Editor Steve Buttry argued that the SPJ should expand its ethics code beyond its pithy “never plagiarize” injunction and urged journalists to be more specific than “press reports” or “reportedly.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1077699012468743">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>The policy-minded perspective of editors suggests that attribution differences may exist between management and employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1077699012468743">64</xref></sup> Leaders must think in broad strokes about objectives and strategies, while subordinates, especially in a professional environment such as a newsroom, exercise discretion in the tactics to reach those objectives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1077699012468743">65</xref></sup> Thus, managers may think more idealistically about attribution, while employees are focused on the practical trade-offs inherent in producing original work on deadline. Similarly, behind-the-scenes workers who assemble newscasts or edit writing may have a different view of attribution because they are a step removed from the in-the-field work of reporters and correspondents.</p>
<p>Career longevity may also influence attribution beliefs. The Internet, with its potential to both dismiss attribution (by normalizing copying) and encourage it (through hyperlinks), may be embraced differently by newer journalists than by more experienced ones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1077699012468743">66</xref></sup> More seasoned journalists perceive standards are declining because of business practices and a hurry-up mentality; newer journalists may see such pressure as the new norm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1077699012468743">67</xref></sup> Also, three decennial surveys have consistently shown that newsroom learning is the primary influence on ethical attitudes, which would allow attribution beliefs to vary with experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1077699012468743">68</xref></sup></p>

<title>Schlenker’s Integrity Scale</title>
<p>To further explore journalism’s tolerance for ambiguous attribution standards, a scale that measures ethical relativity was used. Schlenker’s Integrity Scale presumes integrity exists along a continuum between principles and expediency. It totals Likert-type scale responses to eighteen questions such as, “One’s principles should not be compromised regardless of the possible gain.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1077699012468743">69</xref></sup> The scale presumes people have integrity, yet differ according to the flexibility they grant themselves in their principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1077699012468743">70</xref></sup> Integrity Scale scores were correlated with self-reported plagiarism among students; those who scored toward the expedient end of the scale were more likely to have plagiarized in school.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1077699012468743">71</xref></sup> Other studies have found that people who valued expediency were more likely to prefer a successful yet unethical act over a failed ethical act,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-1077699012468743">72</xref></sup> while those on the principled end were less likely to have cheated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1077699012468743">73</xref></sup></p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Professional journalists in newspapers, online news, radio, and television organizations were surveyed regarding their attitudes toward attribution and the eighteen Integrity Scale statements. The attribution statements were written based on the literature review and on an examination of at least one hundred professional plagiarism cases over the past twenty years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1077699012468743">74</xref></sup> The statements addressed issues such as whether press releases or specific media need to be credited and whether factors such as a desire to avoid interrupting a story’s flow or pressing deadlines mitigated a need for attribution. Responses were made according to a 5-point Likert-type scale. The online survey was approved by a university institutional review board.</p>
<p>Survey respondents were drawn from a database of U.S. journalists maintained by CisionPoint that is built on Bacon’s Media Database.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-1077699012468743">75</xref></sup> Like any similar database, CisionPoint is dependent on the voluntary participation of media organizations, which may choose to submit the names of all staffers, or only managers, or no one at all. The CisionPoint database was used to create a large mailing list with journalists from a broad cross-section of job types and media companies: broadcasting, newspapers, and online organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-1077699012468743">76</xref></sup> That list was culled only to eliminate foreign-language publications and newsletters for religious organizations. An invitation to participate in the survey was sent to 20,191 unique email addresses.</p>
<p>Participation was limited in two ways: A password was required to screen out nonjournalists who might find the survey by chance, and the survey began with a screening question asking if the respondent worked full-time in an organization with at least three people. That limitation was imposed because part-time or freelance employees may not have the same level of commitment to professional norms as a full-timer. Also, those who work alone or in a partnership are not subject to the situational influences that organizations can exert.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-1077699012468743">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the initial email invitation sent October 4, 2011, produced 844 responses, a reminder was sent two weeks later and generated another 188 responses over the following three weeks, for a total of 1,032. Questionnaires with a quarter or more of the responses unanswered were excluded to produce a final <italic>N</italic> of 953, or 5% of the email addresses to which invitations were sent. The true response rate is unknowable because no reliable count of “dead” email addresses was possible and some invitations may have been blocked by spam email filters. Survey response rates have been decreasing for the past couple of decades and achieving even a 20% return often requires multimodal reminders such as postcards and phone calls,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-1077699012468743">78</xref></sup> neither of which was practical for a sample of 20,000. Even still, a 5% response rate is not far removed from those of other large-scale electronic surveys. Editors from only 7% of 1,114 U.S. newspapers responded to a request for staff email lists<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-1077699012468743">79</xref></sup> and just 9% of 2,500 European journalists completed surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-1077699012468743">80</xref></sup> Single-digit rates are acceptable “if the researcher has obtained a reasonable sample size to support the desired statistical power.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-1077699012468743">81</xref></sup> Moreover, technique is more important than response rates; a probability sample with a lower response rate offers greater validity than volunteer panels with higher response rates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-1077699012468743">82</xref></sup> Finally, lower response rates are a concern when drawing population inferences, which was not the purpose of this study.

<p>The Likert-type scale scoring ranged from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). All scales were examined using an exploratory factor analysis and a one- or two-factor solution.</p>
<sec id="section4-1077699012468743">
<title>Attribution absolutes scale</title>
<p>Respondents were asked three questions regarding whether they believed all information derived from other media should be attributed to (a) newspapers or magazines, (b) a radio or television outlet, or (c) an online-only news organization. Respondents showed a high degree of consistency in responding to those three questions, so they were combined into a single scale (Cronbach’s α = .97). A higher score indicated a stronger belief that information from other media should be attributed as an absolute matter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077699012468743">
<title>Attribution exceptions scale</title>
<p>Six statements posed as potential exceptions to a general belief that information from other media should be attributed showed sufficient (approximately .70)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-1077699012468743">83</xref></sup> internal consistency to form a scale (α = .69). Those six were (a) another news medium has to be credited only if it obtained information through an exclusive, (b) another medium’s exclusive does not have to be credited if a few weeks have passed since the originating story was published or aired, (c) another medium’s exclusive does not have to be attributed if the information has been widely repeated, (d) when attributing information derived from other media, use of “reportedly,” without naming the news organization, is sufficient, (e) it is more important to attribute information derived from a national news organization than from a local news organization, and (f) in general, attribution is optional if it would interrupt the flow of the story. A higher score indicated a greater willingness to allow exceptions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077699012468743">
<title>Internet influence scale</title>
<p>Three statements were posed regarding the influence of the Internet on attribution. Two of those were sufficiently correlated to form a scale (α = .69). Those two were (a) thanks to hypertext conventions, journalists today are more likely to attribute their sources of information and ideas, and (b) widespread use of the Internet has encouraged journalists today to be more willing to disclose their sources of information and ideas. The third question, regarding the influence of online competition, was excluded from the scale. A higher score indicated a greater belief that the Internet encouraged more attribution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077699012468743">
<title>Personal standards scale</title>
<p>Six responses were offered for a question asking how journalists made decisions regarding attributing information from other news organizations. Three of those statements involved personal standards: (a) my training, (b) my views on proper professional conduct, and (c) my understanding of journalistic ethics codes. Those three formed a scale (α = .70). A higher score indicated a greater belief that one’s personal standards determined attribution decisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077699012468743">
<title>Organizational standards scale</title>
<p>The other three statements regarding how attribution decisions were made involved organizational influences: (a) what my newsroom colleagues would do in a similar situation, (b) how my boss would probably react, and (c) our organization’s need to be ahead of news competitors. Those three formed a scale (α = .69). A higher score indicated a greater belief that organizational standards determined when other media should be attributed.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 953 journalists who submitted substantially complete surveys, 593, or 62.2%, were men. A total of 176 worked for a broadcast operation that could include a website, for either television (<italic>n</italic> = 149, 15.6%) or radio (<italic>n</italic> = 27, 2.8%). Another 767 worked for a newspaper that could include a website, either a daily (<italic>n</italic> = 568, 59.6%) or a nondaily (<italic>n</italic> = 199, 20.9%). Only 5 worked for an online-only organization, too few for statistical analysis. (The remaining 5 respondents chose an “other” category.) Some 481 (50.5%) were content creators, producing words, pictures, video, graphics, and so on. Another 326 (34.2%) were in management, while 121 (12.7%) worked behind the scenes, such as editing or working a control board. A total of 23 (2.4%) reported that they did not belong to any of the three types of positions, and 2 others did not answer the question. Most were experienced; 562, or 59.0%, had worked in the field for more than twenty years. Another 111 (11.6%) had worked as journalists for sixteen to twenty years, 111 (11.6%) for eleven to fifteen years, 91 (9.5%) for six to ten years, and 78 (8.2%) for five years or less.</p>
<sec id="section11-1077699012468743">
<title>RQ1: Job type</title>
<p>This question asked if respondents differed in their attribution beliefs based on the type of job they held: as a content creator, in a behind-the-scenes position, or in management. Although respondents overall indicated strong support for attribution, ANOVA analyses found two significant differences in terms of the attribution absolutes scale (<italic>F</italic>[2, 906] = 4.62, <italic>p</italic> = .01) and the scale allowing for exceptions (<italic>F</italic>[2, 856] = 13.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Tukey’s HSD post hoc tests found that journalists working behind the scenes (<italic>M</italic> = 4.62, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.57, <italic>n</italic> = 118) were more likely than content creators (<italic>M</italic> = 4.39, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>n</italic> = 472) to see attribution as an absolute value. Meanwhile, content creators (<italic>M</italic> = 2.18, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.61, <italic>n</italic> = 446) were more likely to allow exceptions than were those working behind the scenes (<italic>M</italic> = 1.96, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.53, <italic>n</italic> = 110, <italic>p</italic> = .001) or were managers (<italic>M</italic> = 1.98, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.56, <italic>n</italic> = 303, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). So while respondents generally shunned exceptions, content creators were slightly more willing to embrace them.</p>

<title>RQ2: Career longevity</title>
<p>Multiple regression analysis resulted in a significant model (<italic>F</italic>[4, 870] = 5.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) that predicted career longevity by using four variables measuring attribution attitudes. Two were scales: (a) the three-statement attribution absolutes scale and (b) the three-statement attribution exceptions scale. The other two were statements: (c) good journalism requires the attribution of all sources of information and (d) press releases must be attributed. Those four variables were loaded into the regression model because they reflected the range of issues most likely to be influenced by longevity. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077699012468743">Table 1</xref> shows that more experienced journalists generally were less likely to accept exceptions to attribution and more likely to believe press releases should be credited. Interestingly, more experienced journalists were less likely to agree that good journalism always required attribution, suggesting that experience is associated with a willingness to see gray areas.</p>

<p>This question further explored differences in press-release attribution by comparing responses to that statement with the reaction to the attribution absolutes scale. A paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test found that respondents were significantly more likely (<italic>t</italic> = 22.52, <italic>n</italic> = 940, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) to attribute information from other media (<italic>M</italic> = 4.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.73) than from press releases (<italic>M</italic> = 3.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.15).</p>

<title>RQ4: Employer</title>
<p>A comparison of the individual statements in the attribution exceptions scale with the type of medium for which the respondent worked proved significant for four issues, according to an ANOVA. The first involved this statement: Another news medium has to be credited only if it obtained information through an exclusive, <italic>F</italic>(3, 895) = 5.44, <italic>p</italic> = .001. A Tukey’s HSD post hoc test showed that journalists working for radio (<italic>M</italic> = 3.52, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.25) were significantly more likely than were their peers working for daily newspapers (<italic>M</italic> = 2.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.24, <italic>p</italic> = .001), nondaily papers (<italic>M</italic> = 2.54, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.16, <italic>p</italic> = .001), and television (<italic>M</italic> = 2.53, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.25, <italic>p</italic> = .001) to assert that only information obtained through an exclusive had to be attributed. In other words, radio respondents agreed with that statement, while those in daily newspapers and television disagreed.</p>
<p>The second significant result involved this statement: another medium’s exclusive does not have to be credited if a few weeks have passed since the originating story was published or aired, <italic>F</italic>(3, 896) = 4.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Although respondents overall disagreed with the statement, a Tukey’s HSD post hoc test showed that those working for nondaily papers (<italic>M</italic> = 1.90, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.82) were stronger in their disagreement than were their peers in television (<italic>M</italic> = 2.20, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and radio (<italic>M</italic> = 2.44, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>The third involved this statement: when attributing information derived from other media, use of “reportedly,” without naming the news organization, is sufficient, <italic>F</italic>(3, 895) = 4.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. A Tukey’s HSD post hoc test found that those working for daily papers (<italic>M</italic> = 1.99, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.89) were more likely to disagree with this statement than were their cousins in television (<italic>M</italic> = 2.25, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) or radio (<italic>M</italic> = 2.44,<italic>SD</italic> = 1.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), although all three groups disagreed with “reportedly” as an attribution technique.</p>
<p>The final significant result involved this statement: it is more important to attribute information derived from a national news organization than from a local news organization, <italic>F</italic>(3, 895) = 6.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Overall, respondents strongly disagreed with the statement. Yet a Tukey’s HSD post hoc test showed that television journalists (<italic>M</italic> = 1.83, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.75) were more likely than daily newspapers (<italic>M</italic> = 1.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and nondaily papers (<italic>M</italic> = 1.52, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) to see a difference in whether the originating news organization was national or local.</p>
<p>Correlations between media type and several attribution exceptions, though statistically significant, were in the range of .1, or too small to be meaningful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-1077699012468743">86</xref></sup> For instance, a comparison of whether print and broadcast journalists differed in accepting “reportedly” as sufficient attribution revealed a Spearman’s rho correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .09, <italic>n</italic> = 899, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) that was significant but small.</p>

<title>RQ5: Current factors</title>
<p>This research question asked which of three forces shaping journalism today—the Internet, news competition, and pressure to produce—has the greatest influence on attitudes toward attributing other media. The influence of the Internet was measured by the two-item scale detailed earlier. Two other relevant statements derived from the literature review were posed: (a) my organization is located in a market with lots of news-gathering competitors and (b) at our organization, we’re under intense pressure to produce as much material as we can. Multiple regression analyses showed a significant model (<italic>F</italic>[3, 884] = 3.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) that revealed pressure to produce stood out as the most likely factor to affect respondents’ views on attributing information from other media, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077699012468743">Table 2</xref> shows.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results expose significant disagreements over attribution. Although the SPJ ethics code calls for identifying sources “whenever feasible”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-1077699012468743">87</xref></sup> and <italic>Washington Post</italic> policy asserts that “attribution of material from other newspapers and other media must be total,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-1077699012468743">88</xref></sup> this study revealed that journalists don’t believe in those platitudes.</p>
<p>About a fourth of respondents rejected the prescriptive ideal that good journalism required the attribution of all sources of information, and the most significant exception regarded press releases. Respondents were far more likely to believe that the work of their fellow journalists required attribution than to assert that press releases should be cited explicitly. Some of that difference may be generational, for experienced journalists were more willing than their newer colleagues to indicate that press releases should be attributed. But the reluctance to attribute press releases may also reflect a desire to perpetuate a “pretense of originality”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-1077699012468743">89</xref></sup> and hide journalism’s derivative nature,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-1077699012468743">90</xref></sup> if not contempt for public relations as a field.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-1077699012468743">91</xref></sup> And a belief in crediting peers may flow from professional loyalty enabled by autonomy norms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-1077699012468743">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even when using information from other journalism organizations, respondents were willing to forgo attribution when faced with production pressure. That finding is especially significant in light of sharply deteriorating advertising revenues fueling a do-more-with-less atmosphere that has lessened commitment to traditional journalistic principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-1077699012468743">93</xref></sup> The finding that journalists in a production-focused news operation are significantly more likely to consider attribution optional may indicate that standards are eroding across the profession.</p>
<p>Another important finding is that attribution beliefs varied with the type of job held. Content creators, the people tasked with finding and reporting stories and visuals, were more likely than the people in the office to see attribution as situationally defined. The managers who write the official policies and employees who work behind the scenes editing copy or producing video were less likely to allow for exceptions than were the people in the field. That job-type distinction pinpoints the source of some differences in attribution beliefs and affirms the primacy of professional autonomy.</p>
<p>Differences also can stem from individual-level beliefs about the degree to which people see their principles as flexible, as measured by Schlenker’s Integrity Scale. The scale is an especially pertinent one for journalists expected to produce original reporting under deadline pressure, which requires trade-offs between completeness and speed. Those who see principles as mutable are also more willing to forgo attribution if information obtained exclusively is widely repeated, as happened with the interview Barbara Bush gave NPR after Hurricane Katrina. As journalists increasingly are asked to do more with less,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-1077699012468743">94</xref></sup> autonomy norms suggest they may see attribution standards as fluid, paralleling Schlenker’s scale.</p>
<p>The findings validated assertions that attribution varies with the medium.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-1077699012468743">95</xref></sup> Four attribution exceptions were embraced more warmly by broadcasters than by print journalists. Radio journalists were most likely to agree that only exclusives required attribution, a belief in keeping with a medium that depends on brevity. Likewise, nondaily print journalists were least likely to agree that scoops held an expiration date, a view befitting mostly weekly publications. The data also revealed that television journalists were more likely to think attribution more important for national than for local stories and to consider a generic “reportedly” to be sufficient. Although such findings are not surprising, they show that attribution beliefs are far from universal.</p>
<p>The distinctions identified in this study are meaningful given the possibility that variance was compressed. After taking the survey, nearly a tenth of the respondents sent emails asking to see results, and several wrote notes expressing concern that peers were minimizing attribution. Therefore, the survey may have been most attractive to people who strongly valued attribution. Response bias is a potential concern for any survey and is especially salient for ethical issues, which are vulnerable to social desirability bias.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-1077699012468743">96</xref></sup> Although the survey and all correspondence about it carefully avoided any form of the word “plagiarism,” questions about attribution may have evoked the concept and unintentionally prompted respondents to provide a “correct” answer. Therefore, the study’s findings may understate the intensity of differences.</p>
<p>One of the limitations of the study is that it measures only attitudes, not practice. Journalists may believe they are attributing more frequently than their news reports show. More research like the British elite-press study is needed to measure whether journalists in other countries live up to their attribution ideals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-1077699012468743">97</xref></sup> So, too, is research into the evolving practices of online journalists, only five of whom responded to this survey. Hyperlinks are the closest thing journalism has to footnotes, yet practitioners differ regarding their use and whether links substitute for quotation marks, as media ethics watchdog Jim Romenesko discovered in 2011 when the Poynter Institute accused him of systematic attribution failure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-1077699012468743">98</xref></sup> Another limitation, and thus fodder for future study, is that different measures to evaluate the ethical perspectives of the respondents might offer different insights into attribution. This study used two: whether organizational or personal standards were more influential in ethical decision making, and Schlenker’s Integrity Scale comparing expediency to principles. Other measures, such as Forsyth’s Ethics Position Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-1077699012468743">99</xref></sup> and Victor and Cullen’s Ethical Climate Questionnaire,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-1077699012468743">100</xref></sup> could expand understanding of how journalists think about attribution.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This survey of attribution beliefs revealed how journalists vary from the absolutes they preach. Respondents were far less willing to attribute press releases than they were their colleagues’ work. They were more likely to consider attribution optional if they were under pressure to produce, worked for a broadcast medium, were a content creator, were less experienced, or saw their principles as flexible. The findings reveal that attribution beliefs are far more pliant than ethics policies suggest and reveal some of the reasons why plagiarism occurs. Clearly, journalists cannot expect to thwart plagiarism until they are willing to define their attribution standards.</p>
<p>The data also affirm the primacy given autonomy in professional ideology. Journalists who prize the flexibility that autonomy grants can be expected to prefer a situational approach to determining when information requires attribution. Although strong majorities expressed agreement with attribution in principle, substantial differences arose when confronted with the details. Those differences are less a result of sectarian quarrels between media than a systemic election of personal autonomy as the defining element of professional identity.</p>

<p>CisionPoint limits searches to five thousand names at a time. Thus, the database had to be queried using different parameters (such as organization size, geography, and job title) to stay within the five-thousand-name limit. Those parameters were changed repeatedly in an attempt to exhaust the database. The results were aggregated into an Excel file so duplicates (based on email address) could be removed.</p>

<p>Although a Cronbach’s alpha of .70 is often cited as “acceptable,” the value of that number is inversely related to the number of items in the scale. An alpha of .70 is more difficult to achieve with fewer than ten scale items than with more than ten items. Furthermore, alpha tends to underestimate the degree to which the scale items interrelate.
