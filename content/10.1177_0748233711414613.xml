<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible protective effects of quercetin (QE) on liver injury caused by chronic toluene exposure in rats. The rats were randomly allotted into one of three experimental groups: control, toluene treated and toluene treated with QE; each group contained 10 animals. The control group received 1 ml physiologic serum, and toluene treatment was performed by inhalation of 3000 ppm toluene, for 8 h/day and 6 days/week for 12 weeks. The rats in the QE-treated groups were given QE (15 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) once a day for 12 weeks starting just after toluene exposure. Tissue samples were obtained for histopathological investigation. To date, no histopathological changes in the liver of rats after chronic toluene exposure by QE treatment have been reported. Light microscopic evaluation of liver tissue samples of toluene-exposed rats revealed enlarged sinusoids filled with blood. In addition, some of the hepatocytes showed loss of cytoplasm, and some had a hyperchromatic nucleus. QE treatment attenuated alterations in liver histology. The alpha smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor beta-positive cells and the activity of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling in the toluene-treated group were observed to be reduced with QE treatment. The data indicate that QE attenuates toluene-induced liver injury, but further investigation is still absolutely necessary.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Toluene is generally regarded as being toxic to both central and peripheral nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711414613">Filley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711414613">Gotohda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711414613">Greenberg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711414613">Smith, 1990</xref>) and has previously been shown to induce neurobehavioral and electrophysiological changes in experimental animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233711414613">Kishi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711414613">Magnusson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233711414613">Wood and Colotla, 1990</xref>). In addition to these neurotoxic effects, toluene has also been reported to exert the acute and chronic effects on peripheral tissues, for instance renal, adrenal, cardiovascular and epidermal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711414613">Coleman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711414613">Einav et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711414613">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711414613">Gotohda et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, most organic industrial solvents are considered toxic and hence induce damage to the liver, resulting in fatty liver, hepatomegaly and cirrhosis. However, despite considerable efforts to elucidate the hepatotoxic effects of toluene and its derivatives, it seems still controversial whether the exposure to these substances may actually induce substantial damage to the liver in the factory workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233711414613">Boewer et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233711414613">Guzelian et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711414613">Morris, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Flavonoids are a group of naturally occurring compounds widely distributed as secondary metabolites in the plant kingdom. They have been recognized for having interesting clinical properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antiviral, antibacterial and antitumoral activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711414613">Middleton, 1998</xref>). One of these flavonoids, quercetin (QE; 3,5,7,3′,4′-pentahydroxyflavone), prevents oxidant injury and cell death by several mechanisms, such as scavenging oxygen radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711414613">Bors et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233711414613">Inal et al., 2002</xref>), protecting against lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711414613">Laughton et al., 1991</xref>) and chelating metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233711414613">Afanas’ev et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The aims of the present study were to assay the preventive and therapeutic potential of QE on rat hepatic damage induced by chronic toluene inhalation.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0748233711414613">
<title>Experimental procedures</title>
<p>QE was obtained from Sigma Chemical (St Louis, MO, USA) and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 60% ethanol just before intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (15 mg/kg). Control group was injected with the same volume of saline as the toluene-treated groups received.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0748233711414613">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>A total of 30 healthy male Wistar albino rats, weighing 200–250 g and averaging 16 weeks old were utilized in this study. The animals were purchased from a local supplier and housed in individual cages (360 × 200 × 190 mm) 1 month before the start of the experiments. Food and tap water were available ad libitum. In the windowless animal quarter automatic temperature (22 ± 2°C) and lighting controls (light on at 07 a.m. and off at 09 p.m.: 14-h light/10-h dark cycle) were maintained. Humidity ranged from 50% to 55%. All animals received human care according to the criteria outlined in the ‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’ prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0748233711414613">
<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>The rats were randomly allotted into one of three experimental groups: control, toluene treated and toluene treated with QE; each group contains 10 animals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0748233711414613">
<title>Solvent exposures</title>
<p>Animals in toluene treated and toluene treated with QE groups were exposed to 3000 ppm toluene (Merck, 99.5%) in inhalation chambers equipped with a trap and designed to sustain dynamic and adjustable airflow (11,250 mg/m<sup>3</sup>). These animals were housed in individual cages within an inhalation chamber for 8 h/day (from 08 a.m. to 04 p.m.). This application was continued 6 days/week for a total of 12 weeks. Toluene was vaporized by bubbling additional airflow through a flask containing the test compound. The solvent concentration in the chambers was continuously monitored using a gas chromatography. Control animals were housed in identical chambers ventilated with fresh air.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0748233711414613">
<title>Drug preparation and sample collection</title>
<p>The control group received 1 ml saline and toluene treatment was performed by inhalation of 3000 ppm toluene, for 8 h/day and 6 days/week for 12 weeks. The rats in QE-treated group were given QE (15 mg/kg body weight) once a day intraperitoneally for 12 weeks starting just after toluene exposure. At the end of the solvent exposure, all animals were anesthetized with i.p. injection of sodium thiopenthal (100 mg/kg, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Twenty minutes later, the anesthetized rats were killed. Animals were pinned onto a dissection board and the thoracal cavity was opened. Thus, immediately the liver tissues were removed for histopathological investigation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0748233711414613">
<title>Histopathologic evaluation</title>
<p>The liver specimens were individually immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated in alcohol and embedded in paraffin. Lobular architecture, presence of inflammation and necrosis were investigated. Lobular and portal inflammation, focal hepatocyte necrosis and interface activity were scored as in modified hepatitis activity index of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711414613">Ishak et al. (1995)</xref>. Fibrosis was assessed in sections stained with Masson’s trichrome. The histopathological fibrosis were grouped as no fibrosis (scored as 0), portal fibrosis (scored as 1), septal fibrosis (scored as 2), incomplete cirrhosis (scored as 3) and complete cirrhosis (scored as 4). Histopathological examination was carried out by a pathologist who had no prior knowledge of the animal groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0748233711414613">
<title>Immunohistochemical procedures</title>
<p>The harvested liver tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 μm thickness. Immunohistochemical reactions were performed according to the avidin–biotin complex (ABC) technique described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711414613">Hsu et al. (1981)</xref>. The procedure involved the following steps: (1) endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by 3% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in distilled water for 30 min; (2) the sections were washed in distilled water for 10 min; (3) nonspecific binding of antibodies was blocked by incubation with normal goat serum (DAKO X 0907, Carpinteria, CA, USA) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), diluted 1:4; (4) the sections were incubated with specific mouse monoclonal anti-actin, smooth muscle antibody (Cat. # MS-113-P, Neomarkers, USA) and rabbit polyclonal anti-TGF-β1 antibody (Sc-146, Lot # 12006, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), diluted 1:50 for 1 h at room temperature; (5) the sections were washed in PBS 3 × 3 min; (6) the sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; DAKO LSAB 2 Kit) (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA, USA); (7) the sections were washed in PBS 3 × 3 min; (8) the sections were incubated with ABC (DAKO LSAB 2 Kit); (9) the sections were washed in PBS 3 × 3 min; (10) peroxidase was detected with an aminoethylcarbazole substrate kit (AEC kit) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA); (11) the sections were washed in tap water for 10 min and then dehydrated; (12) the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin; and (13) the sections were mounted in DAKO paramount. All dilutions and thorough washes between steps were performed using PBS unless otherwise specified. All steps were carried out at room temperature unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>The number of α-SMA-positive hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in each specimen was scored using the system developed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711414613">Schmitt-Graff et al., 1991</xref>) with modification. Ten randomly selected septa were scored for each specimen in every experiment as follows: 0 = no positive response; 1 = less than 10% of HSCs; 2 = 11–20% of HSCs; 3 = 21–40% of HSCs; and 4 = more than 40% of HSCs.</p>
<p>Quantification of TGF-β1 immunoreactive hepatic cells, including hepatocytes, in each specimen was also scored. Ten randomly selected septa at low magnification (×100) were scored as follows: 0 = no positive response; 1 = less than 10% of hepatic cells; 2 = 11–20% of hepatic cells; 3 = 21–30% of hepatic cells; 4 =more than 30% of hepatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233711414613">Lam et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0748233711414613">
<title>TUNEL assay</title>
<p>The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method, which detects fragmentation of DNA in the nucleus during apoptotic cell death in situ, was employed using an apoptosis detection kit (TdT-Fragel<sup>TM</sup> DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit, Cat. No. QIA33, Calbiochem, USA). All reagents listed below are from the kit and were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions. Liver sections of 5-µm-thickness were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series as described previously. They were then incubated with 20 mg/ml proteinase K for 20 min and rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by incubation with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Sections were then incubated with equilibration buffer for 10–30 min and then terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) enzyme, in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C, for 90 min. They were subsequently put into pre-warmed working strength stop/wash buffer at room temperature for 10 min and incubated with blocking buffer for 30 min. Each step was separated by thorough washes in TBS. Labelling was revealed using diaminobenzidine (DAB), counter staining was performed using methyl green, and sections were dehydrated, cleared and mounted.</p>
<p>The number of TUNEL-positive hepatic cells, including hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells, in each specimen was also scored. Ten randomly selected septa were scored for each specimen in every experiment as follows: 0 = no positive response; 1 = less than 10% of hepatic cells; 2 = 11–20% of hepatic cells; 3 = 21–40% of hepatic cells; and 4 = more than 40% of hepatic cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0748233711414613">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS statistical software (SPSS for windows, version 11.0). All data were presented as mean (±) standard deviations (SD). Differences in measured parameters among the three groups were analyzed with a nonparametric test (Kruskal-Wallis). Dual comparisons between groups exhibiting significant values were evaluated with a Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. These differences were considered significant when probability was less than 0.05.</p>

<title>Histopathologic findings</title>
<p>The sections of the control group were stained with Masson’s trichrome and examined under the light microscope. After that, liver tissue was observed to be in normal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711414613">Figure 1a</xref>). Light microscopic evaluation of liver tissue samples of toluene-exposed rats revealed enlarged sinusoids filled with blood. In addition, some of the hepatocytes showed loss of cytoplasm, and some had a hyperchromatic nucleus. Hepatic fibrosis is typical pathological damage observed in the liver and well known to be connected with cirrhosis, and hence considered to appear at an early stage of cirrhotic change in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711414613">Figure 1b</xref>). QE treatment attenuated alterations in liver histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711414613">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748233711414613">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Industrial organic solvents are generally considered highly toxic to the liver, and strongly induce pathogenic changes in the hepatic cells and tissues, resulting in serious hepatopathic diseases, such as fatty liver, hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in factory employees chronically exposed. However, each of the organic solvents is known to show different hepatotoxicity, and some of them, such as chlorinated solvents, are extremely toxic to the liver. On the other hand, monoaromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene and its derivatives, are thought to be relatively less toxic to the liver. The hepatotoxic effect of toluene is still unclear and remains to be further investigated. To further elucidate the hepatotoxicity, the effect of toluene inhalation on the expression of histological markers for hepatic damage in the liver was examined using an immunohistochemical technique.</p>
<p>In one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711414613">Gotohda et al., 2009</xref>), the general histological methods, such as an Azan-Mallory staining and a Sirius Red staining, were also applied to examine the hepatotoxic damage, and the positive staining of fibrous proteins in the liver, but no noticeable destruction of the tissue structure, was observed in the animals subjected to toluene inhalation. Therefore, it seems likely that toluene inhalation is toxic to the liver and may be able to induce some hepatic damage under the experimental conditions used here. Therefore, it seems possible that this toluene-induced hepatic changes may be related to and could eventually induce hepatic fibrosis. In the present study, light microscopic evaluation of liver tissue samples of toluene-exposed rats revealed enlarged sinusoids filled with blood. In addition, some of the hepatocytes showed loss of cytoplasm, and some had a hyperchromatic nucleus. QE treatment attenuated alterations in liver histology.</p>
<p>Although the hepatotoxic effects of various organic solvents are ordinarily regarded as already established, a causal connection between toluene inhalation and liver injury is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233711414613">Boewer et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711414613">Dossing et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233711414613">Guzelian et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711414613">Howell et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711414613">Morris, 1989</xref>), and these inconsistent results existing in relation to the hepatotoxic effect of toluene inhalation can be explained as a consequence of differences in the exposure conditions and also considered to be attributed to the different sensitivity in examining liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233711414613">Franco et al., 1986</xref>). In one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711414613">Gotohda et al., 2009</xref>), to detect the early stage of hepatotoxic changes, the immunohistochemical analyses of histological markers for hepatic fibrosis were then carried out, and the expression of both a-SMA and collagen in the liver was shown to be clearly enhanced by exposing the animals to toluene vapor. Likewise the above mentioned data, we have found in our study that the positive stainings for α-SMA were greatly increased especially in vascular smooth muscle cells and sinusoids and also in the cells of portal ducts, fibrotic septa, perisinuses and around the proliferated bile ducts. The α-SMA-positive cells in the toluene-treated group were observed to be reduced with QE treatment.</p>
<p>Previously, the initiation of hepatic fibrosis has been associated with glucocorticoid-activated TGF-β1 signaling pathway and leptin receptor-mediated signaling pathway in HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711414613">Gressner and Weiskirchen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233711414613">Ikejima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233711414613">Saxena et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233711414613">Wickert et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233711414613">2007</xref>). On the other hand, toluene inhalation has been shown to stimulate glucocorticoid production in rats under the same conditions used in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711414613">Gotohda et al., 2005</xref>). Based on these previous findings, it seemed possible to assume that both glucocorticoid- and leptin-mediated signaling pathways might be involved in the toxic effect of toluene inhalation on the liver. To find a clue in elucidating the signaling pathway involved in the hepatotoxic effect of toluene inhalation, the expression of glucocorticoid receptors and leptin receptors in the liver was determined, and the immunoreactivities of these two receptors were shown to be enhanced by exposing the animals to toluene vapor. Thus, the obtained results seem to provide evidence for suggesting a possible implication of glucocorticoids and leptin in the exacerbation of hepatic damage induced by toluene inhalation, resulting possibly in the development of hepatic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711414613">Gotohda et al., 2009</xref>). In our study, more marked responses for TGF-β1 were obtained in hepatocytes frequently localized around central veins in toluene-treated rats. A moderate staining for TGF-β1-positive cells in the toluene-treated group was also observed in hepatocytes around central veins with QE treatment.</p>
<p>Apoptosis is a physiologic process that entails the programmed death of a cell and indicates tissue injury. To date no information about the TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells on toluene-induced liver injury in rats have been reported. However, in the present study, when liver sections were TUNEL stained, there was a clear increase in the number of positive cells in the toluene-treated rats in the liver parenchyma. QE treatment markedly reduced the reactivity and the number of TUNEL-positive cells.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these findings suggested that QE attenuates toluene-induced liver injury, but further investigation is still absolutely necessary.</p>
