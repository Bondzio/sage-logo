<abstract>
<p>The predictive accuracy of STABLE-2000 and STABLE-2007 was examined within a prospective research design in a German-speaking sample of 263 adult male prison-released sexual offenders followed up for an average of 6.4 years. The STABLE-2007 was significantly related to all outcomes (AUC = 0.67-0.71), whereas the STABLE-2000 demonstrated only weak predictive accuracy for sexual reoffense (AUC = 0.62). Supporting the results of the construction sample, the STABLE-2007 incrementally added to the predictive accuracy of the STATIC-99 for violent and general reoffense (conviction and incarceration). Moreover, the STABLE-2007 total scores and the nominal risk/need categories made significant incremental contributions over the SORAG for predicting sexual reoffense.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Risk assessment of sexual offenders and offenders in general—according to a professional consensus achieved in the 1990s—should be based on factors empirically related to recidivism risk and done in a structured manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211403164">Harris &amp; Hanson, 2010</xref>). As regards to the structure, there is at least some agreement among researchers. To be considered a risk factor, there needs to be evidence that there is a meaningful relationship between the specific characteristic of concern and the risk of reoffense. Also, as there is a consensus that risk is multiply determined, it is evident that a single risk factor cannot adequately predict recidivism. Evaluators have to consider a range of risk factors assessed within a structured framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1079063211403164">Mann, Hanson, &amp; Thornton, 2010</xref>). Structured approaches to assessing risk in sexual offenders have been consistently found to be more accurate than unstructured judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The ideal risk assessment would not only predict perfectly, but would also provide useful information about relevant risk factors which might be changed by therapeutic interventions or by risk management in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2009</xref>). Such changeable risk factors are also called “dynamic” risk factors. The research base for dynamic risk factors is well developed for general offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1079063211403164">Bonta &amp; Andrews, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063211403164">Dowden, Antonowicz, &amp; Andrews, 2003</xref>), but much less developed for sexual offenders. Dynamic risk factors have to, by definition, be changeable or at least potentially changeable through interventions (e.g., treatment). These changes are expected to be related to alterations in risk. To be truly (as opposed to merely potentially) dynamic, a variable would have to be assessed at two points in time. Moreover, changes between these two points of time would have to be shown to be linked to changes in recidivism rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211403164">Olver, Wong, Nicholaichuk, &amp; Gordon, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Initial research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Harris (2001)</xref> concluded that dynamic risk factors for sexual offenders include the following variables: (a) sexual self-regulation, (b) general self-regulation, (c) intimacy deficits, (d) compliance and understanding for the need of treatment and control, (e) existence of supportive significant others, and (f) distorted attitudes or attitudes tolerant of sexual violence. The authors compared sexual recidivists to nonrecidivists (serious nonsexual recidivists were excluded) during community supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Harris, 2000</xref>). This research resulted in the Sex Offender Need Assessment Rating (SONAR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Harris, 2001</xref>); the first risk-assessment instrument designed to specifically address potentially changeable dynamic risk factors among sexual offenders. The measure consisted of five stable and four acute items combined into a total score. Stable dynamic risk factors were defined as enduring characteristics of the individual (e.g., hostility toward women) that, albeit changeable, were likely to change slowly and typically only with effortful processing. In contrast, acute risk factors were defined as features (e.g., victim access) that could change rapidly. All of the SONAR items were found to significantly differentiate between recidivists and nonrecidivists (although SONAR raters were not blinded for outcome), even once static risk factors were controlled for by the STATIC-99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Thornton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211403164">Harris, Phenix, Hanson, &amp; Thornton, 2003</xref>) or by the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1079063211403164">Quinsey, Harris, Rice, &amp; Cormier, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1079063211403164">2006</xref>). However, importantly, the base rate for recidivism (which was sexual and serious violent reoffense) was artificially set at 50% and the study was retrospective in nature. As such, the authors noted the need for caution when interpreting the results. Notwithstanding this caveat, the authors found general self-regulation deficits to have the strongest effect in predicting reoffense and noted that their findings were consistent with the concept of “dynamic antisociality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1079063211403164">Quinsey, Coleman, Jones, &amp; Altrows, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The need for a prospective study led Hanson and Harris to establish the Dynamic Supervision Project (DSP). Ultimately, this resulted in the SONAR being modified and renamed the STABLE-2000 and ACUTE-2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211403164">Harris &amp; Hanson, 2010</xref>). The construction of the STABLE-2000/ACUTE-2000 was heavily influenced by the concept of dynamic antisociality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1079063211403164">Quinsey, Coleman, Jones, &amp; Altrows, 1997</xref>), the concept of sexualized coping, and the observation that child molesters often identified with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1079063211403164">Wilson, 1999</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211403164">Harris &amp; Hanson, 2010</xref>). The DSP included 997 offenders from 16 different jurisdictions. Each member of the sample was serving a period of community supervision for a sexual offense and was prospectively assessed with the STATIC-99 and (in almost all cases) the STABLE-2000. The STATIC-99 evaluations and STABLE interviews were done within a routine supervision practice by trained probation officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211403164">Hanson, Harris, Scott, &amp; Helmus, 2007</xref>). Offenders’ follow-up time averaged 41 months. Approximately 7% recidivated with a sexual crime, and 13.5% recidivated with a violent crime (both reoffense categories were ascertained from the criminal rapsheet alone). Although the STABLE-2000 was positively related with most of the recidivism outcome criteria (sexual, violent, general, with and without breaches), a revision of some of the STABLE-2000 items was undertaken to improve predictive accuracy. These changes resulted in the STABLE-2007. In brief, the three “attitude” items were dropped and scoring criteria for another three items were redefined. Also, the procedure for calculating the total score was simplified.</p>
<p>Whether or not a dynamic predictor should add to the predictive accuracy of static risk factors is still a debate. Some authors argue that dynamic risk factors do not necessarily have to demonstrate incremental validity, as their utility for treatment planning and risk reduction is equally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211403164">Olver et al., 2007</xref>). Other authors claim that to be a “real dynamic predictor,” the variable should not only demonstrate incremental validity to the static risk factors but also, a change of the variable should correlate with a change in risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1079063211403164">Harris et al., 2003</xref>). Of course, this requires the variable to be measured at least at two points in time. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211403164">Hanson et al. (2007</xref>, p. 19) found that the amount of change between the first and second assessment was unrelated to any form of recidivism, but that the second STABLE assessment in their study significantly contributed beyond the first stable assessment as regards to risk for sexual reoffense. However, as there were only six sex crime recidivists in the group of those having been assessed two times, the authors recommended treating their results with caution.</p>
<p>In an independent replication study of 59 sexual offenders with a preventive order (issued to high-risk offenders in the community), the STABLE-2007 was also found to significantly predict general recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1079063211403164">Lussier, Deslauriers-Varin, &amp; Ratel, 2010</xref>). However, its ability to predict sexual reoffense could not be determined as only one of the offenders recidivated sexually.</p>
<p>Similar risk-relevant stable dynamic domains are described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211403164">Olver et al. (2007)</xref> in the Violence Risk Scale—Sexual Offender Version (VRS:SO). The VRS:SO includes static and several dynamic risk factors. A factor analysis revealed three underlying dynamic factors: (a) sexual deviance, (b) criminality, and (c) treatment responsivity. These domains added incremental predictive power to static risk-assessment tools. Reductions in the dynamic risk variables were associated with lower recidivism after measurements of static risk and follow-up time were controlled for. Also, posttreatment dynamic scores of the VRS:SO were found to be significantly related to sexual recidivism after controlling for VRS:SO static scale scores in a sample of 218 prison-released child molesters receiving treatment in New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1079063211403164">Beggs &amp; Grace, 2010</xref>). Both studies, however, were retrospective and even treatment change was estimated retrospectively by analyzing reports and other file information. Therefore, ratings could have been contaminated by knowledge of the static risk scores.</p>
<p>The current study is part of a prospective longitudinal research project to evaluate the reliability and validity of German versions of risk-assessment tools for sexual offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1079063211403164">Rettenberger, Matthes, Boer, &amp; Eher, 2010</xref>). For the purposes of the current study, we were particularly interested in whether the German version of the STABLE-2007 would also predict relevant risk categories in a sample of prison-released sexual offenders. Also, although the results of the DSP on the predictive validity of the STABLE versions are promising, independent replication of those findings is necessary. The present study, therefore, describes the predictive and incremental validity of the German version of the STABLE-2000 and the STABLE-2007 in an independent sample of 263 adult sexual offenders.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 263 adult male sexual offenders who have been evaluated between October 2001 and February 2005 at the Federal Evaluation Centre for Violent and Sexual Offenders (FECVSO) in the Austrian Prison System. Participants were included if they had a sexual crime as the index offense and had been released to the community for a minimum of 50 months before August 1, 2010. Offenders were serving a mean sentence length of 32.3 months (<italic>SD</italic> = 22.0). Mean duration between date of assessment and release was 16.7 months (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.2). The FECVSO is a department under the Austrian Ministry of Justice. In brief, since the end of 2001, every sexual offender who receives an unconditional prison sentence by an Austrian court has to be reported to the FECVSO. Following a prescreening based on a file-based risk assessment showing that the offender meets at least one of the following criteria, the offender is selected for the clinical forensic assessment: (a) a STATIC-99 total score of more than five, <italic>or</italic> (b) age under 25, <italic>or</italic> (c) a prison sentence of more than 4 years, <italic>or</italic> (d) a conviction for a child abuse offense with a nonrelated victim, <italic>or</italic> (e) a reconviction for a sexual crime. This means that about 60% of the offenders are routinely seen for risk assessment by experienced forensic psychiatrists and psychologists at the FECVSO.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1079063211403164">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>All offenders included in the study had one or more index convictions for a sexual offense. According to their index offense, 49% (<italic>N</italic> = 128) were rapists (defined as sexual perpetrators with victims who were at least 14 years of age), and 50.9% (<italic>N</italic> = 133) were child molesters (defined as sexual perpetrators with victims less than the age of 14 years). Two offenders could not be allocated to either of the groups: one had anal intercourse with a 16-year-old boy (which was a crime in Austria until 2004), and one was sentenced for bodily harm which, during incarceration, was determined to be sexually motivated and thus was reported to the FECVSO. The mean age of the sample at the time of release was 41.1 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.6). The mean follow-up period was 6.4 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.9). A minimum of 50 months of follow-up was required for inclusion in the study. Only two of the offenders were of African ethnicity, all others were White.</p>
<p>A comprehensive forensic assessment is routinely performed including at least three experienced forensic psychologists or psychiatrists. The aim of the assessment is to facilitate correctional planning and treatment. Risk assessment is one part of the evaluation process and actuarial instruments as well as structured professional judgment methods are an integral part of the assessment. The management of the FECVSO assures confidentiality with regard to scientific analyses of the data. The evaluation is in accordance with the legal and ethical demands of the Austrian Ministry of Justice and in accordance with the national Data Protection Act. The obligation of the FECVSO is to continuously empirically evaluate the accuracy of its risk-assessments tools.</p>
<p>The standardized risk-assessment instruments used at the FECVSO include the STATIC-99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211403164">Harris et al., 2003</xref>), STATIC-2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1079063211403164">Phenix, Doren, Helmus, Hanson, &amp; Thornton, 2009</xref>), Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interests (SSPI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1079063211403164">Seto, Harris, Rice, &amp; Barbaree, 2004</xref>), Sexual Offender Risk Appraisal Guide (SORAG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1079063211403164">Quinsey et al., 2006</xref>), Sexual Violence Risk—20 (SVR-20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063211403164">Boer, Hart, Kropp, &amp; Webster, 1997</xref>), and Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1079063211403164">Hare, 1991</xref>). In addition, in 2001 we started to routinely use the Sexual Offender Needs Assessment Rating (SONAR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Harris, 2001</xref>), and subsequently its successors, the STABLE-2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Harris, 2004</xref>) and the STABLE-2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211403164">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>STATIC-99</title>
<p>The STATIC-99 is a brief actuarial instrument which was designed to predict sexual recidivism with a limited number of easily scored variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211403164">Harris et al., 2003</xref>). It is probably the most commonly used and the best validated actuarial instrument for assessing the risk in sexual offenders. The items were drawn from the Rapid Risk Assessment for Sexual Offenders (RRASOR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1079063211403164">Hanson, 1997</xref>) and the Structured Anchored Clinical Judgment (SACJ-Min; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063211403164">Grubin, 1998</xref>). It consists of 10 static risk factors: Age when exposed to risk, any live-in intimate relationship for 2 or more years, any index offense of nonsexual violence, any prior offense of nonsexual violence, number of prior charges or convictions for sexual offense, number of prior sentencing dates, any conviction for noncontact sexual offense, any unrelated victims, any stranger victims, and any male victims. The items are added up to a maximum total score of 12 which is translated into four risk categories: low (0-1), medium low (2-3), medium high (4-5), and high (6 or more). The STATIC-99 was tested for its predictive accuracy using mixed data sets of 1,301 sexual offenders in Canada and the United Kingdom. The STATIC-99 yielded predictive accuracy values of AUC = .71 for sexual and AUC = .69 for any violent (including sexual) recidivism. Further independent studies, including an authorized German version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063211403164">Eher, Rettenberger, &amp; Matthes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1079063211403164">Rettenberger &amp; Eher, 2006</xref>), have also demonstrated its predictive validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1079063211403164">Barbaree, Seto, Lanton, &amp; Peacock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063211403164">Ducro &amp; Pham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211403164">Endrass, Urbaniok, Held, Vetter, &amp; Rossegger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1079063211403164">Rettenberger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1079063211403164">Sjostedt &amp; Langstrom, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Sexual Offender Risk Appraisal Guide (SORAG)</title>
<p>The SORAG is an actuarial risk-assessment tool designed to predict violent recidivism (including sexual offences involving physical contact with the victim) for sexual offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1079063211403164">Quinsey et al., 2006</xref>). The measure consists of 14 weighted items: Lived with both biological parents up to age of 16, elementary school maladjustment, history of alcohol problems, marital status, criminal history for nonviolent offenses, criminal history for violent offences, previous convictions for sexual offences, sexual offences against girls less than 14 years only, failure on prior conditional releases, age at index offense, DSM criteria for any personality disorder, DSM criteria for schizophrenia, phallometric tests indicating deviant sexual interests, and PCL-R score. Based on the total score, the offender is allocated to one of nine risk categories. A variety of studies has supported its predictive validity for violent (including sexual) recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211403164">Harris &amp; Rice, 2003</xref>). The German version has also been found to accurately predict general (AUC = .73), violent (AUC = .76), and sexual (AUC = .73) recidivism in sexual offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1079063211403164">Rettenberger &amp; Eher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1079063211403164">Rettenberger et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>The Sexual Offender Needs Assessment Rating (SONAR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Harris, 2001</xref>) and the STABLE-2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Harris, 2004</xref>) were translated into German, with permission of the authors, by our research group in 2001. The SONAR and STABLE-2000 became part of the routine assessment process. However, the changes to two items on the STABLE-2007 version (lovers/intimate partners, sexual deviance), were done retrospectively by analyzing reports and files.</p>
<p>The STABLE-2000 consists of 16 stable risk factors. These items are scored according to a manual using a three-point rating scale (0 = <italic>no problem</italic>, 1 = <italic>some problem</italic>, 2 = <italic>definite problem</italic>). The minimum information required according to the rules of the STABLE-2000 is a structured interview and a file review of the offender. The 16 items are organized into six sections. The sections are defined as follows: Significant Social Influences (identifying helpful and prosocial people in the offender’s life who are not paid for their help), Intimacy Deficits (consisting of five items: status of the current relationship, emotional identification with children, hostility toward women, loneliness/feeling of rejection, lack of concern for others), Sexual Self-Regulation (consisting of three items: sexual preoccupation/sex drive, sex as coping and deviant sexual interests), Attitudes Supportive of Sexual Assault (consisting of sexual entitlement, attitudes tolerant of rape, or of sex with children), General Self-Regulation (consisting of three items: impulsive acts, poor problem solving skills, negative emotionality/hostility), and a section assessing the degree to which the offender was cooperating with supervision. The STABLE ratings are based on recent and past behavior, but the primary judgment is the expected behavior during the next 6-12 months.</p>
<p>In revising the STABLE, it turned out that seven of the 16 items of the STABLE-2000 showed a significant linear relationship to all recidivism outcomes (negative social influences, hostility toward women, rejection/loneliness, lack of concern for others, lack of cooperation, impulsive acts, poor problem solving). Another three items showed significant linear relationship to the outcome they were supposed to predict: sexual recidivism (sexual preoccupation/sex drive, sex as coping), violent and general recidivism (negative emotion/hostility). Those 10 items were retained without change in the STABLE-2007.</p>
<p>The item “lovers/intimate partners” was revised and changed into, “stability of the current relationship” now also taking into account whether the offender had ever lived with a lover for a minimum of 2 years. All attitude items were omitted in the STABLE-2007 version as none of these items correlated with outcome. The item “emotional identification with children” was retained, but only scored for child molesters in the STABLE-2007 version. As the item “deviant sexual arousal” was only weakly related to outcome in the STABLE-2000 version, this item was also revised so that offense history was more clearly considered in the assessment of sexual deviance. Specifically, two to seven victims of sexual offenses results in a score of “1,” and more than seven victims results in a score of “2.” Alternatively, one “deviant victim” results in a score of “1,” and two or more “deviant victims” results in a score of “2.” Two other criteria to consider when scoring deviant sexual arousal include the self-report of deviance, and the results of specialized tests such as phallometry. In contrast to the STABLE-2000, the total score is obtained by simply summing all the individual items rather than the highest score in a particular category.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this study, Item 1 (Significant Others) of the STABLE-2000 and STABLE-2007 was omitted. As all offenders were serving a prison sentence at the time of assessment and would have done so for a mean of another 16.7 months, it was concluded that this item could not be accurately scored.</p>

<title>Procedures and Overview of Analyses</title>
<p>Results were subsequently compared with official recidivism data (in terms of reconviction information). Data on reconviction were retrieved from the Federal Central Register of the Austrian Ministry of Internal Affairs on August 1, 2010. Each new conviction listed on the official criminal record was counted as a reoffense. We used the following recidivism criteria: general criminal reoffense (each new conviction for any kind of reoffense), violent reoffense (each new conviction for a nonsexual violent and sexual hands-on offense), sexual reoffense (each new conviction for a sexual hands-on or hands-off offense), and reimprisonment for a violent offense and an offense in general. After an average of 6.4 years follow-up, 10.3% (<italic>N</italic> = 27) were reconvicted for a sexual crime, 24.3% (<italic>N</italic> = 64) for a violent crime, 39.5% (<italic>N</italic> = 104) for a general crime, 28.1% (<italic>N</italic> = 74) were sent to prison again for any kind of reoffense, and 18.3% (<italic>N</italic> = 48) for violent reoffense.</p>
<p>The association between the STABLE “domains” (sections) and recidivism was examined using correlation coefficients. For the STABLE-2000, the worst score of each section represents the section score. For the STABLE-2007 summing all items is the option used for calculating the total score. Although the calculation of section scores is not part of the rules, we added the relevant item scores into the “Intimacy Deficits” section, the “Sexual Self-regulation” section, and the “General Self-regulation” section for further correlational analyses with outcome.</p>
<p>The predictive accuracy of the risk-assessment instruments was measured by calculating AUC values of ROC curves. This procedure is commonly used to examine the predictive accuracy of binary decisions. AUC is a standard measure of diagnostic and predictive accuracy in clinical and forensic research because it is not influenced by base rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1079063211403164">Rice &amp; Harris, 1995</xref>). For calculating 5-year recidivism estimates associated with each STABLE-2007 nominal risk category and each STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 priority category, we used logistic regression analyses. Confidence intervals for the estimated recidivism rates for each category were obtained from standard errors (<italic>SE</italic>). From the <italic>SE</italic>, confidence intervals (CI) for the estimated recidivism rates (as logits) for each risk category were calculated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063211403164">Hanson, Helmus, and Thornton (2010)</xref>. For testing base rate differences, we compared the expected recidivism rates of the original DSP sample (Appendix 8, p. 42 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211403164">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>) with the observed in the current sample. For this purpose, we used the original STABLE-2007 risk categories and fixed 4 years follow-up rates. The statistics used to compare the observed and expected rates was a traditional global chi-square analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1079063211403164">Backhaus, Erichson, Plinke, &amp; Weiber, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1079063211403164">Gail &amp; Pfeiffer, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Incremental predictive validity of the STABLE scores was tested by Cox regression survival analyses. Cox regression estimates relative risk ratios associated with one or more predictor variables from data with unequal follow-up times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1079063211403164">Hanson, 2006</xref>). Similar to an Odds Ratio (OR), the rate ratio (hazard rate; Exp[B]) resulting from Cox regression analysis is an indicator of the strength of the association between predictor and outcome.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were conducted with PASW statistics 18.0.0 and SAS<sup>®</sup> (Version 8.2) for Windows.</p>

<title>Interrater Reliability</title>
<p>The interrater reliability of risk-assessment instruments was assessed on 15 randomly selected cases and evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). All ICCs were highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for the SORAG (ICC = 0.93), the STABLE-2000 (ICC = 0.89), and the STABLE-2007 (ICC = 0.90), and excellent for the STATIC-99 (ICC = .98). The average score for the STATIC-99 in our sample was 3.3 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.2), and for the SORAG 5.7 (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.4). In the total sample, the average STABLE-2000 score (without Item 1“significant others”) was 7.5 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.5), and the average STABLE-2007 score (without Item 1 “significant others”) was 10.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.9).</p>

<sec id="section11-1079063211403164">
<title>Correlational Analyses of Actuarials and STABLE Domains With Outcome</title>
<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063211403164">Table 1</xref>, the STATIC-99, the SORAG, and the STABLE-2007, but not the STABLE-2000, significantly correlated with all types of outcome measures. As regards the STABLE-2000 domains, only the Cooperation With Supervision item, but no other STABLE-2000 domain was significantly related to sexual reoffense. Intimacy Deficits of the STABLE-2000 was found to be weakly related to violent and general reoffense, whereas General Self-Regulation was related to general recidivism and to being sent to prison again. When constructing such domains with STABLE-2007 items—which is not part of the original STABLE-2007 scoring system—Intimacy Deficits, and problems in General Self-Regulation were significantly related to all outcomes. Sexual Self-Regulation, however, was related to sexual and general reoffense, but was not related to the violent reoffense categories. Violent recidivism was most strongly associated with Intimacy Deficits, and general recidivism was associated strongest with problems with General Self-Regulation.</p>

The STABLE-2000, however, demonstrated relatively weak predictive accuracy for sexual reoffense (AUC = 0.62), and even less accuracy for predicting general reoffense (AUC = 0.55) and general reincarceration (AUC = 0.59). The STABLE-2000 did not predict violent reoffense. As the STABLE-2000 scores demonstrated relatively weak predictive accuracy, the STABLE-2000 was excluded from further analyses.</p>

<title>Observed and Estimated Recidivism Rates of FECVSO Nominal Risk Categories</title>
<p>For the STABLE-2007 in the original DSP sample, a total score of 0-3 was defined to be low dynamic risk/need, 4-11 moderate dynamic risk/need, and 12 and above as high dynamic risk/need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211403164">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>). However, even though the first item (Significant Social Influences) of the STABLE-2007 was omitted in our study, we found a meaningful higher STABLE-2007 average score (10.9 vs. 7.5) and a quite different distribution of the STABLE-2007 total scores in relation to sexual reoffense. Therefore, for our study, we proposed the following risk/need categories for the STABLE-2007: 0-7 FECVSO low need, 8-12 FECVSO moderate need, 13, 13+ FECVSO high need (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1079063211403164">Table 3</xref>). The distribution of these FECVSO STABLE-2007 risk categories were as follows: 12.5% (<italic>N</italic> = 32) low risk, 59% (<italic>N</italic> = 151) medium risk, and 28.5 (<italic>N</italic> = 73) high risk. The new FECVSO STABLE-2007 need categories yielded better predictive accuracy indices compared to the original cut-offs (AUC = 0.682, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 vs. AUC = 0.615, <italic>p</italic> = 0.026).</p>

<p>The STABLE-2007 manual also includes a revised algorithm creating five STATIC/STABLE nominal risk/need categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211403164">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>): low, moderate-low, moderate-high, high, and very high priority. The distribution of the combined FECVSO STATIC/STABLE nominal risk/need priority categories were as follows: 25.4% (<italic>N</italic> = 65) were allocated to the FECVSO low priority category, 25.8% (<italic>N</italic> = 66) to the FECVSO moderate-low priority category, 23.8% (<italic>N</italic> = 61) to the FECVSO moderate-high priority category, 14.5% (<italic>N</italic> = 37) to the FECVSO high priority, and 10.6% (<italic>N</italic> = 27) to the FECVSO very high priority group. For estimating sexual recidivism rates for a specific FECVSO STABLE-2007 risk category and a specific FECVSO STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 nominal priority category, we calculated (a) observed recidivism rates and (b) values from the fitted regression curves of a fixed 5-year follow-up. Results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1079063211403164">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1079063211403164">Table 5</xref>. According to the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness of fit test, the observed sexual recidivism rates in the total sample in relation to FECVSO STABLE-2007 and FECVSO STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 categories approximated a logistic distribution (<italic>p</italic> = .369, <italic>p</italic> = .094, respectively).</p>

<title>Incremental Validity of the STABLE-2007</title>
<p>An important question was whether the STABLE-2007 variables would add useful information about risk beyond that captured by actuarials (STATIC-99 or SORAG). For this purpose, we conducted a hierarchical survival analysis (Cox regression analysis). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1079063211403164">Table 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1079063211403164">Table 8</xref>, the STABLE-2007 sumscore made a significant incremental contribution over the STATIC-99 for reimprisonment (general and violent), and for reoffense in general. The FECVSO STABLE-2007 nominal risk categories made a significant incremental contribution over the STATIC-99 for all reoffense categories except for sexual reoffense, which approached significance (<italic>p</italic> = .086).</p>

<title>Controlling the Predictive Model of the FECVSO STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 for Relevant Moderator Variables</title>
<p>Given the fact that the age item of the STATIC-99 recently was found not to fully account for the effect of age on sexual recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1079063211403164">Helmus, Babchisin, Hanson, &amp; Thornton, 2010</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1079063211403164">2</xref></sup> and that rapists were found to differ from child molesters in as much as rapists showed higher recidivism rates at a given STATIC-2002 score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063211403164">Hanson et al., 2010</xref>), a Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the relative contribution of age and victim type as moderator variables.</p>
<p>The FECVSO STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 priority categories were entered in the first block of each analysis to control for risk. Age at release and victim type was entered as a block in Step 2. For sexual recidivism, for neither victim type, Wald (1) = 3.46, <italic>p</italic> = .063, Exp (<italic>b</italic>) = 2.22, 95% CI = [0.96-5.14], nor age at release, Wald (1) = 0.01, <italic>p</italic> = .913, Exp (<italic>b</italic>) = 1.002, 95% CI = [0.97-1.03], incremental effects could be found. Age at release, Wald (1) = 12.24, <italic>p</italic> = .001, Exp (<italic>b</italic>) = 0.97, 95% CI = [0.95-0.99], but not victim type, Wald (1) = 2.87, <italic>p</italic> = .090, Exp (<italic>b</italic>) = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.46-1.1]), however, was found to have a significant relationship with general recidivism once the FECVSO STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 priority categories were controlled for. Concerning the outcome variable “sent to prison again,” only the victim type, Wald (1) = 5.77, <italic>p</italic> = .02, Exp (<italic>b</italic>) = 0.52, 95% CI = [0.31-0.89], but not age at release, Wald (1) = 2.90, <italic>p</italic> = .09, Exp (<italic>b</italic>) = 0.98, 95% CI = [0.96-1.00], significantly predicted outcome. As a child molester, the probability of being charged with a prison sentence was only half of that of rapists at a given FECVSO STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 score. Both, victim type, Wald (1) = 8.08, <italic>p</italic> = .004, Exp (b) = 0.42, 95% CI = [0.23-0.76], and age at release, Wald (1) = 7.93, <italic>p</italic> = .005, Exp (<italic>b</italic>) = 0.97, 95% CI = [0.95-0.99] were significantly related to violent recidivism. Child molesters were found to have a 42% risk for reoffending violently compared to the rapist group at any given FECVSO STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 category. Also, each year of age was associated with a 3% decrease of risk for violent reoffense. Both, victim type, Wald (1) = 5.71, <italic>p</italic> = .017, Exp (<italic>b</italic>) = 0.43, 95% CI = [0.21-0.86], and age at release, Wald (1) = 6.25, <italic>p</italic> = .012, Exp (<italic>b</italic>) = 0.97, 95% CI = [0.94-0.99], incrementally added to the predictive power of FECVSO STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 categories concerning violent recidivism with incarceration. Again, each year of age was associated with a 3% decrease of risk for violent recidivism with incarceration. Child molesters—in comparison with rapists—exhibited a 43% decrease of risk for being sent to prison for a violent offense at any given FECVSO STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 category.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether a German version of the STABLE-2000 and the STABLE-2007 would predict relevant outcome criteria in a sample of incarcerated sexual offenders after a mean follow-up of 6.4 years at risk. Moreover, we were particularly interested whether the STABLE assessment would incrementally contribute to the predictive power of static risk variables.</p>
<p>In general, the current results are consistent with the results of previous studies showing that dynamic risk variables contribute to predictive accuracy beyond that provided by static variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Harris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211403164">Olver et al., 2007</xref>). Also, our results confirmed previous findings about the utility of the STABLE-2007 in predicting relevant reoffense categories in sexual offenders.</p>
<p>However, on close inspection of the results, the STABLE-2000—in contrast to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211403164">Hanson et al. (2007)</xref>—did not meaningfully predict any of the recidivism categories. The STABLE-2007, however, clearly outperformed the STABLE-2000 by showing moderate to good predictive ability with significant AUCs for all outcome variables (AUCs from 0.67 to 0.71), and, moreover and more importantly, turned out—in some cases—to be a significant predictor even after controlling for static risk variables: The FECVSO STABLE-2007 nominal risk categories and STABLE-2007 total scores both added incremental predictive power to the STATIC-99 for violent reoffense (conviction and incarceration) and for general reoffense (conviction and incarceration). However, the STABLE-2007 total score failed to make a significant incremental contribution to the STATIC-99 when predicting sexual recidivism. The FECVSO STABLE-2007 nominal risk categories performed somewhat better but only approached significance (<italic>p</italic> = .086). However, the STABLE-2007 total scores and the FECVSO nominal risk/need categories did add incremental power to the SORAG when predicting sexual reoffense. They failed to do so for any of the other reoffense categories unless marginally for the outcome of reimprisonment.</p>
<p>A possible explanation for this difference is the basic construction of the STATIC-99—which was created to predict sexual reoffense—and the SORAG—which was created to predict violent reoffense—and, consequently, the fact that risk-prediction tools perform best for the reoffense category they were designed for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2009</xref>). As such, it is a challenge for dynamic measures to add incremental validity to the prediction of sexual reoeffence in the case of the STATIC-99 and violent and general recidivism in the case of the SORAG. However, given that offenses leading to a prison sentence probably cause most harm to victims, the performance of prediction tools for the “reimprisonment” categories (especially because of violent offenses) might arguably be of most interest. In predicting this outcome, the STABLE-2007 was found to be most helpful, adding incrementally to the STATIC-99 and to the SORAG (even if only approaching significance concerning the “violent reoffense—imprisonment” category; <italic>p</italic> = .059).</p>
<p>The results of the correlation analyses revealed associations between STABLE domains and recidivism. As a whole, the STABLE-2000 did not correlate significantly with either sexual or general and violent recidivism. Only a few STABLE-2000 dimensions were associated with reoffense. Cooperation With Supervision was the only variable of the STABLE-2000 which significantly correlated with sexual reoffense, whereas General Self-Regulation and Intimacy Deficits were only moderately associated with general and violent reoffense. The STABLE-2007 domains Intimacy Deficits and General Self-Regulation, however, were found to be moderately to strongly associated with all reoffense categories, with an obviously stronger association between Intimacy Deficits and violent relapse, and between problems in General Self-Regulation and general reoffense. Therefore, it appears that the predictive power of these domains was significantly improved by the revisions made as a result of the Dynamic Supervision Project. Given that two variables of the Intimacy Deficits dimension were changed (“emotional identification with children” and “lovers/intimate partners”), it was not surprising that the STABLE-2007 dimension Intimacy Deficits yielded stronger correlation coefficients as compared to the STABLE-2000. Notably, the General Self-Regulation section of the STABLE-2007 is identical to the STABLE-2000. Nevertheless, the STABLE-2007 General Self-Regulation scale—in contrast to the STABLE-2000 General Self-Regulation scale—was found to significantly correlate with all outcomes. Given that the item was not revised, the change in the procedure for calculating the score must be responsible for this improvement. According to the STABLE-2000 scoring rules, the highest score in each subsection counts for the section score, whereas, according to the STABLE-2007 scoring rules, all item scores are summed. The latter rule might provide more chance for variance for the section score.</p>
<p>There was no significant association found between the STABLE-2000 Sexual Self-Regulation scale and sexual recidivism. The domain, however, was improved within the STABLE-2007 revision. A weak, but significant relation was found between the STABLE-2007 Sexual Self-Regulation domain and sexual reoffense. Given the strong association typically found with sexual deviance and sexual reoffense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Bussiere, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1079063211403164">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2005</xref>), one would have expected higher correlations. However, even in the construction sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211403164">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>), the Sexual Self-Regulation items were found to be weakly related to sexual outcome (sexual preoccupation: AUC = 0.58, sex as coping: AUC = 0.62, deviant sexual interests [version STABLE-2007]: AUC = 0.58).</p>
<p>Although a comparison of observed (our study) and estimated (DSP sample) original STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 nominal risk categories suggested no differences in absolute risk prediction between samples, the original nominal risk/need categories proposed for the STABLE-2007 were not optimal for our sample. The predictive accuracy of the STABLE-2007 need categories could be improved by using new cut-offs for our sample (from AUC 0.615 to 0.682).</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the higher STABLE-2007 average score might be the fact that our sample was a prison sample and (a) as selection was done also by risk-relevant variables, might share characteristics of a preselected high-risk sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063211403164">Hanson et al., 2010</xref>), or (b) the assessment procedure within the prison done by experienced forensic psychologists and psychiatrists would automatically lead to a more prudent and cautious appraisal of the offender, given that the primary STABLE judgment is the expected base rate or typical behavior during the next 6-12 months given opportunity to offend.</p>
<p>As the logistic distribution was an acceptable approximation for the FECVSO STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 nominal risk categories and sexual reoffense outcome, we calculated predicted 5-year values from the logistic regression curves. The FECVSO “low” and the FECVSO “low-moderate” STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 priority categories exhibited very low sexual reoffense rates with confidence intervals not overlapping with the FECVSO “high” and the FECVSO “very high” priority category. Further Cox regression analyses, however, revealed a variation in most recidivism categories dependent on victim type (rapist/child molester) and age at release. For general and violent, but not for sexual recidivism, age at release turned out to predict outcome beyond that captured in the FECVSO STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 priority categories, leading to a decrease in risk of about 3% per year.</p>
<p>The influence of age on criminal recidivism is empirically supported, and it is generally seen to be invariant across jurisdictions, gender, and race. However, the influence of age on sexual recidivism has been a controversial issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063211403164">Hanson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1079063211403164">2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1079063211403164">Barbaree and Blanchard (2008)</xref> hold the view that research supports an age-related decline of sexual recidivism. Similar findings resulted in the formulation of new age weights, when it was found that age at release added incremental predictive validity to the STATIC-99 (STATIC-99R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1079063211403164">Helmus et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1079063211403164">Harris and Rice (2007)</xref>, however, argue that these findings might be a result of differences between younger and older cohorts in static risk factors. They believe that age at first offense is the best age-related predictor variable and they argue that “. . . present results afford no empirical basis for the postevaluation clinical adjustment of actuarial scores (. . .) based on an offender’s having gotten older” (p. 310-311).</p>
<p>In our sample, however, no influence of age (at release) on sexual recidivism could be found beyond that captured in the STATIC-99.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1079063211403164">3</xref></sup> Our findings about the influence of age at release depending from the reoffense category (sexual vs. violent/general), therefore, might support both sides of this controversial issue. Victim type was found to remain a significant moderator variable for the “violence” risk categories once the model was controlled for FECVSO STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 priority categories. The rate of violent reoffense among the child molesters was half the rate of the rapists.</p>
<p>In summary, our study provides further support for the utility of the STABLE-2007 in risk prediction of sexual offenders. STABLE-2007 scores were not only found to predict sexual reoffense, but also general and violent reoffense. The combination of STATIC-99 and STABLE-2007 led to a significant improvement of risk prediction over the STATIC-99 scores alone. However, the reoffense category, age, and victim type were found to significantly impact outcome. A combination of an actuarial and a dynamic risk-prediction tool, therefore, was demonstrated to lead to an improvement in predictive accuracy in sexual offenders, whereas prior research found “no combination method [of actuarials alone] provided a statistically significant or consistent advantage over the predictive accuracy of the single best actuarial scale” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1079063211403164">Seto, 2005</xref>, p. 156). Also, the current data demonstrate the predictive validity of the STABLE-2007 and a combination of STATIC-99/STABLE-2007 in a non-North American sample.</p>
