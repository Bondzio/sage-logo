<abstract>
<p>This paper presents an analysis of the growth and diversification of international involvement in urban planning and development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Over the past decade, a multiplicity of mainly intra-Asian connections have emerged alongside the continued involvement of Western donor aid. The paper shows how various forms of international finance capital, development capital and local capital vie for influence amongst a loose assemblage of alliances and conflicts linking elements of the Cambodian government, international donors and Cambodian and intra-Asian private-sector actors. The paper highlights the on-going efforts of government–private-sector alliances to ‘world’ Phnom Penh and to assert a greater claim to its significance in the world. These desires are seen to have overridden plans produced in partnership with the development sector. Attention is drawn to the intra-Asian mobilities through which these processes operate and which, in doing so, contribute to the on-going unsettling of existing geographies of urban knowledge.</p>

<body>
<p>Sustained rapid economic growth in Cambodia over much of the past decade has been accompanied by a similarly rapid transformation of the built environment in the capital, Phnom Penh. In what is becoming a familiar pattern throughout Asia, skyscrapers, edge-city projects and other large developments are being promoted as ‘world class’ urban spaces and are seen to contribute to the city’s international significance. These ambitious projects—which include Grand Phnom Penh International City, CamKo City, Diamond Island City, Boeung Kak Town and Chruy Changva City—have been variously proposed, financed, implemented and in many cases aborted, by a range of Korean, Malaysian, Chinese and Cambodian investors and developers and supported by the municipal and national governments. While these patterns of intra-Asian investment and private planning are now familiar, they take place alongside the continued involvement of Western donors in urban planning—most notably, in the development of the 2020 master plan, an ambitious French-funded project intended to guide both public and private development in the city until 2020.</p>
<p>Political power in Cambodia is highly centralised, and the power to approve projects and implement policy lies firmly with the Cambodian government. Yet with high levels of aid dependence and small government budgets, most large urban policy and development initiatives involve international funding and expertise. In this paper, I argue that the current development of Phnom Penh is notable for the particularly high level of involvement of both foreign development assistance and foreign direct investment, and find that the ability of the state to guide, restrict and integrate these processes with reference to a broader urban vision is highly limited. Various forms of international finance capital, development capital and local capital vie for influence amongst a loose assemblage of alliances and conflicts linking elements of the Cambodian government, international donors and Cambodian and intra-Asian private-sector actors. The paper details how the 2020 master plan, an effort to counter the limited capacity of the municipal government and provide a basis for integrated urban development, has been largely unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Through this analysis, I aim to highlight the processes and challenges of on-going efforts of government–private-sector alliances to ‘world’ the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098012452457">Roy and Ong, 2011</xref>), or parts thereof, and to assert a greater claim to the significance of Phnom Penh in the world. I will draw attention to the intra-Asian mobilities through which these processes operate and which, in doing so, contribute to the on-going unsettling of existing geographies of urban knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098012452457">Robinson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098012452457">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0042098012452457">Roy, 2009</xref>). I begin with an overview of the urban developments in Phnom Penh since 1998. This is followed by a theoretical positioning of these processes; a preliminary investigation of the networks of actors and institutions involved in urban governance in the municipality; and an analysis of the processes of planning, implementation and opposition for some of the larger private development projects.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Fieldwork for this paper took place in Phnom Penh during August and September 2010. During this time, I rented a house in the largest of Phnom Penh’s new edge city projects, CamKo City, and took the opportunity to experience and observe the lifestyle offered by these projects. This recent fieldwork builds on an extended engagement with Phnom Penh and Cambodia more broadly in both a professional and research capacity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098012452457">1</xref></sup> which has taken place over a cumulative total of three years since 2002. The fieldwork on which this paper is based involved 88 face-to-face interviews ranging in length from 8 minutes to over 3 hours. Interviews were conducted with a range of key figures chosen for their involvement in the contemporary urban development of Phnom Penh, as well as a range of lay people residing in the city. Interviews with key figures included staff from: Phnom Penh Municipal Government (PPMG); the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC); Grand Phnom Penh International City; CamKo City; the World Bank; UNDP’s Seila programme; and the opposition party MP for Phnom Penh, Yim Sovann. In most cases, access was facilitated by introductions made through previously established academic and professional networks. Interview requests were made by e-mail and generally followed up by phone. In the case of the PPMG, a formal written interview request was required and repeated phone calls and visits to City Hall were necessary before an interview was granted. Interviews were conducted in English and/or Khmer. While my spoken Khmer language was often sufficient for much of the interview, an interpreter was present at all interviews to assist with translation and clarification. Interviews were recorded where consent was granted and transcriptions were made of all English and Khmer dialogue.</p>

<title>Phnom Penh since 1998</title>
<p>In the period from 1998 to 2007, Cambodia’s economic growth was the sixth fastest in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012452457">Guimbert, 2010</xref>, p. 2) and the second fastest in Asia after China. Its yearly per capita income more than doubled from US$285 in 1997 to US$593 in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0042098012452457">World Bank, 2009</xref>, p. ix). Still, Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the region and remains classified by the United Nations as a least developed country (LDC). This period of sustained economic growth involved significant structural changes in Cambodia’s economy, its social and cultural networks and processes, and its urban form. There has been significant growth in the manufacturing sector and, with it, the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs and the migration of huge numbers of rural workers to fill them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012452457">Heinonen, 2008</xref>). At the same time, aspects of Phnom Penh’s existing infrastructure, much of which is aged and damaged due to neglect in the years of war, have struggled to keep up with this development and rapid population growth. Notably, the drainage system is beyond capacity, a problem exacerbated by the reclamation of urban lakes for development projects and increases in the proportion of paved roads. As a result, much of the city routinely floods during the wet season, although this has improved in recent years with the implementation of JICA-funded drainage improvement projects.</p>
<p>The 2008 census measured the population of the municipality of Phnom Penh at approximately 1.3 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098012452457">National Institute of Statistics, Royal Government of Cambodia 2008</xref>). This is generally believed to be a conservative measure, with unofficial estimates placing the population as high as 2 million. According to the PPMG, there are approximately 250 000 people living outside the borders of the municipality in areas such as Ta Khmau, who commute into Phnom Penh during the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012452457">Chhay and Huybrechts 2009</xref>). Official measurements of Cambodia’s urbanisation and the growth of the population in Phnom Penh are relatively slow compared with those of other countries with similar levels of sustained rapid economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0042098012452457">World Bank, 2009</xref>, p. 104); however, these official estimates utilise a very conservative measurement of the population. Based on this comparison, it is expected that it will accelerate quickly in coming years as GDP per capita continues to increase.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098012452457">2</xref></sup> The PPMG forecast a doubling of the population of the city over the next 20 years, with more significant growth taking place in ‘secondary centres’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012452457">Chhay and Huybrechts, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>On the city’s outskirts, there has been a huge growth in low-budget accommodation catering to the huge, predominantly female, garment factory worker population. As many as 90 private communities have been developed, gated and otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098012452457">Phnom Penh Capital Hall, 2011a</xref>), including developments consisting of large numbers of identical shop houses ranging from one to four storeys, many of which remain vacant. This belt of development—much of which was farmland just a decade ago—houses many of Cambodia’s garment factories, as well as a special economic zone established in 2005 and targeted at international manufacturing operations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098012452457">3</xref></sup> At similar distances from the city centre, over 40 relocation sites have been established to house the often forcibly evicted former residents of informal settlements in the city centre. The presence and visibility of the urban poor in the central city is consistently decreasing, with growth of low-income informal settlements taking place on the city’s outskirts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012452457">Heinonen, 2008</xref>). The eviction of residents of informal settlements in the central city has played a significant role in this process, as have night-time sweeps of Phnom Penh’s streets that have sought to ‘clean’ the city of ‘undesirables’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012452457">LICADHO, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012452457">Human Rights Watch, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In and around the city’s historical centre, numerous high-rise projects are in various stages of planning, approval and construction. Five edge-city projects are planned—land has been acquired and work has begun on four of these, but progress has typically been slow and occupancy rates are low. Phnom Penh follows similar patterns in the region, with plans to surround the historical centre with privately developed and managed ‘global’ enclaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012452457">Douglass and Huang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098012452457">Percival and Waley, 2012</xref>). Yet with construction as slow as it is, these privately developed districts do not (yet) significantly divide the social fabric of the city. Still, they point to desires for, and the high likelihood of, a future ‘splintering urbanism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012452457">Graham and Marvin, 2001</xref>) in Phnom Penh with the quality of privately controlled infrastructure systems guided by profitability.</p>
<p>Rapid economic growth and an influx of investment in property development saw a corresponding increase in the price of land in and around the city. Increased demand and rising land values have produced numerous conflicts over land rights, exacerbated by a weak land law and land titling legislation and implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0042098012452457">Un and So 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0042098012452457">Springer (forthcoming)</xref> offers an alternative assessment of this process, positioning the strengthening of the legal system as a means of legitimising the dispossession of the poor by Cambodian élites. For many Cambodians, claims to ownership of land—including state public land—are made through a traditional understanding of ownership based on occupation, community consensus and actual land use. These claims have been deemed to be illegal following the strengthening of the Cambodian legal system.</p>
<p>This period of rising land values and speculation and conflict over land rights, has followed the abolition of private ownership and the evacuation of Phnom Penh under the Democratic Kampuchea regime in the late 1970s. With the redistribution and privatisation of land that started in 1989 and the formal recognition of private ownership that came in the early 1990s, those who knew how to satisfy the registration requirements were able to secure the necessary documentation to prove ownership of land. This significantly benefited more powerful, well-connected people, to the detriment of those who lacked the knowledge and resources to navigate the registration process successfully. Private-sector actors have been aided by the police and the military in establishing and guarding land concessions throughout the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012452457">Hughes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0042098012452457">Springer, 2011</xref>). Caroline Hughes observed in 2008 that, throughout Cambodia,<disp-quote>
<p>a relatively egalitarian distribution in 1989 ha1s given way to sharp inequality: the top 10% now own 64% of the land and the top 1% own an estimated 20%–30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012452457">Hughes, 2008</xref>, p. 71).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Forced evictions have been common during this transition, with rights groups such as LICADHO estimating that as much as 10 per cent of Phnom Penh’s population has been displaced since 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098012452457">LICADHO, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Shatkin’s description of Phnom Penh over a decade ago, as a city that is undergoing “tremendous social and spatial transformation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0042098012452457">1998</xref>, p. 383) is as pertinent today as it was then. Over the past decade, issues of land tenure and the eviction of informal settlements in the city centre have been prominent in analyses of urban planning and property development in Phnom Penh (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012452457">Hughes, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012452457">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012452457">Khemro and Payne, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0042098012452457">Springer, 2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0042098012452457">2010</xref>). Relatively little attention has been paid to the local and regional processes and references that inspire and drive development in the city. Many of the large private development projects in Phnom Penh have not involved forced evictions. I am not aware of any forced evictions associated with the edge-city projects built by Korean and Indonesian firms whereas evictions have been a feature of all Chinese-linked edge-city projects. It is important to recognise that this does not represent the entirety of Phnom Penh’s urban development and also to explore the broader developments across the city and the agency that drives them. Analyses of these social and spatial transformations have been few and, to date, little has been published addressing the influence of increasing mobility—of capital, people and knowledge—on the actions of the government, private and development sectors, and ultimately on Phnom Penh’s urban form.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0042098012452457">4</xref></sup>

<title>Transnational Mobility and Shifting Geographies of Urban Knowledge</title>
<p>The case of Phnom Penh can make important contributions to on-going debates that seek to unsettle existing geographies of urban theory and policy knowledge. As we shall see, intra-Asian processes are highly important in the on-going transformation of the city. Jennifer Robinson’s critique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098012452457">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098012452457">2006</xref>) challenges the geography of urban theory, whereby cities in the ‘first world’ are seen as models for the generation of theory and policy, and those in the ‘third world’ are seen as problems to be diagnosed and resolved. Moreover, when policy initiatives are being undertaken in poor countries, it is often assumed that these solutions have been developed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098012452457">Robinson, 2011b</xref>). This understanding has reinforced a longstanding division in urban studies whereby urban theory is broadly focused on the West, and development studies focus on the ‘third world’. Through these associations<disp-quote>
<p>understandings of city-ness have come to rest on the (usually unstated) experiences of a relatively small group of (mostly western) cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098012452457">Robinson, 2002</xref>, p. 531).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evidence of such a limited geographical understanding can be found in documents produced by French planners who worked on Phnom Penh’s 2020 master plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012452457">Bureau des Affaires Urbaines, 2007</xref>), for whom French cities appear to be the most common foreign reference point for the development of Phnom Penh, followed by North American cities.</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0042098012452457">Ananya Roy (2009a)</xref> has argued that the centre of urban theory must move from Europe and North America to the global South, where the majority of contemporary urbanisation is taking place. Roy seeks to start mapping out a new, more worldly geography of urban theory, disrupting existing geographies of core and periphery, instead positing multiple cores and peripheries included <italic>within</italic> the global South. As we shall see, urban planning and development in Phnom Penh draws knowledge, people and capital from a diverse range of influential cities, most of which are not located in Europe or North America. To account for diversity of this nature, a number of authors (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012452457">McCann and Ward, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098012452457">Robinson, 2011a</xref>) have argued for an understanding of cities that gives due attention to the relationality of cities while simultaneously acknowledging their territorial nature. Such an approach highlights the connections that exist between cities beyond the economically significant, formal, international connections that are the focus of the global and world cities approaches. These connections exist in tension with the fundamentally territorial process of policy-making, which takes place in local political, historical and geographical circumstances.</p>
<p>A growing number of studies have theorised and documented the transnational mobility of urban policy. In a handful of cases, this has been explicit, with particular cities directly seeking to emulate others. Examples include policy transfer from Kuala Lumpur to Hyderabad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012452457">Bunnell and Das, 2010</xref>), Mumbai’s efforts to establish itself in the model of Shanghai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012452457">Huang, 2008</xref>) and the replication of urban form in parts of Vancouver, Hong Kong and Dubai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098012452457">Lowry and McCann, 2011</xref>). Such cases contribute to the on-going unsettling of the assumption that innovation and policy originate in the West and are imitated elsewhere. These direct, explicit cases of policy emulation or transfer from one city to another are less common than policy-making and urban development that draws less explicitly from a wider range of cities. In the case of Phnom Penh, and as has been documented in many other cities such as Kabul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012452457">Calogero, 2011</xref>), Hanoi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098012452457">Labbé and Boudreau, 2011</xref>), Khartoum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012452457">Choplin and Franck, 2010</xref>) and many Indian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042098012452457">Roy, 2009b</xref>) and African (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0042098012452457">Simone, 2001</xref>) cities, urban development is influenced by a range of local, regional and international actors.</p>
<p>Of course, the transnational flow of planning knowledge is not new. In colonial Phnom Penh, as in many colonial cities, urban planning and development undertaken by the colonial administration referenced European models of the city and, in some instances, ideas derived from ‘urban experiments’ in the colonies were subsequently implemented in European cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042098012452457">Roy, 2011</xref>, p. 11). What is newly significant, however, is the number of referenced city models and the number of actors seeking to implement these models in Phnom Penh. Stephen Ward argues that, in the flows of planning knowledge and expertise in post-colonial cities, the years following independence typically involved a shift from an “almost exclusive dependence on the planning approaches and personnel of the colonial powers” to a diverse range of external links and the strengthening of indigenous planning capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0042098012452457">Ward, 2010</xref>, p. 47).</p>
<p>The early years of Phnom Penh’s independence certainly saw a strengthening of indigenous planning capacity, but links to France remained the most significant international influence in Phnom Penh’s urban development. The process that Ward has described more broadly was disrupted by Cambodia’s descent into conflict. This saw a decrease in the implementation of urban planning and development and, ultimately, the near-complete abandonment of Phnom Penh. The repopulation of the city was followed by a period of relative isolation with international connections existing primarily with Soviet-aligned states. Ward argues that in today’s post-colonial, post-communist world, where market principles are broadly ascendant, former colonial territories are more diverse than ever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0042098012452457">Ward, 2010</xref>, p. 67). This is certainly reflected in Phnom Penh, which, in the current post-intervention era, is experiencing an unprecedented diversification of external links in urban planning and development.</p>
<p>The constitution of these external links, through which flows of people, information, ideas and capital are facilitated, reflects complex and uneven geographies of economic and political power. The production of urban space is deeply linked with flows of capital, not simply the flows of finance capital that enable the development of skyscrapers and edge-city projects, but also the flows of development capital that finance planning studies and infrastructure projects, which typically come tied with associated conditions and reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042098012452457">Roy 2011</xref>, p. 12). With relatively low levels of internal revenue contributing to the municipal budget, the development of public infrastructure in Phnom Penh relies heavily on foreign aid and private investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012452457">Bureau des Affaires Urbaines, 2007</xref>, pp. 167–168).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0042098012452457">5</xref></sup> Since the early 1990s, Japan and France have been the biggest providers of urban-focused aid and more recently the significance of international private-sector actors—most notably involving capital from South Korea and China—has increased dramatically.</p>
<p>Hence, government decision-making processes are inevitably influenced by the availability of funding from a diverse range of development partners. In the case of the private sector, these include less formal partnerships that reach beneath the bureaucratic veneer of government and engage directly with members of the ruling party—either through explicit business partnerships with individuals, or through opaque relationships with members of government. City visions articulated in the context of these partnerships each reference elements of an eclectic array of cities from throughout the region and the world. In the following sections, I will elaborate on the diversity of influences shaping contemporary Phnom Penh and will begin to explore some of the causes and results of the city’s disjointed urban planning and development—within government and in the multiplicity of international actors in the development and private sectors.</p>

<title>The Landscape of Urban Governance in Phnom Penh</title>
<p>Cambodia’s government and the inner workings of the ruling party are both characterised by general opacity. Phnom Penh is no exception to this tendency and thus it is difficult to establish a thorough understanding of the dynamics of debate in policy-making in the city. However, there is some evidence of conflict and competition for power within the structure of the public service and between elements of the ruling party.

<p>powerful shadow network of patron–client links that underpins the state, party, and military apparatus, while also entailing the superficiality of its rational-legal veneer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012452457">Hughes, 2009</xref>, p. 157).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both agree that informal, personal-level negotiations play an important role in Cambodian politics, and that they co-exist with a formal bureaucratic veneer. These processes are not effectively challenged by Cambodia’s relatively weak political and civil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0042098012452457">Un 2006</xref>). Hence, a large part of the contest and debate over city visions takes place behind closed doors and away from public scrutiny.</p>
<p>Caroline Hughes positions the opacity of political processes in Cambodia as—at least from the government’s point of view—an effective response to Cambodia’s aid-dependence. She argues that “the Cambodian government saw the intrusions of donors into policy-making as inhibiting” and minimised these intrusions by establishing a mode of operation that was “both opaque to donor scrutiny and highly effective in brokering accommodations with powerful groups politically” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012452457">Hughes, 2009</xref>, p. 156). Hughes notes that, although corruption had been present in Cambodia prior to the influx of aid in the 1990s, it was in this aid-dependent period that it became institutionalised and systemic as the ruling party strengthened its networks of patronage in response to the emergence of electoral competition. Hughes argues that Hun Sen’s opaque style of governance has achieved some degree of moral authority in the eyes of donors. While in many areas it is antithetical to development-sector notions of ‘good governance’, it appears to be working in achieving economic and political stability and more recently in the reduction of poverty and improvements in human development indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012452457">Hughes, 2009</xref>, p. 163).</p>
<p>Simon Springer describes a similarly opaque system of governance, but considers its emergence to be primarily the result of an economic system that has been characterised by donor-led reforms, combined with the co-option and transformation of these reforms by local élites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0042098012452457">Springer, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0042098012452457">2010</xref>). The staunch refusal of the government to allow any oversight on the part of any non-state actors has allowed political leaders to spend money gained from the exploitation of state resources entirely as they see fit, unimpeded by the restrictions of the law. Both Hughes and Springer agree that this has entrenched the threat of violence as part of the political system, has produced broad social and political alienation and has increased inequalities of wealth and power. In terms of urban planning and development, this opacity results in a relative lack of public debate. This means that analysis of internal government processes in Phnom Penh is partially speculative and anecdotal. However, there is enough evidence to suggest that these processes are disjointed and sometimes contested without being able to conduct a thorough analysis.</p>
<p>The opacity of these processes is illustrated by the approval process of the 2020 master plan. The plan envisages the development of Phnom Penh as a multipolar city with growth taking place in secondary centres, connected to the historical city centre by restored waterways and corridors of greenery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0042098012452457">Tricaud, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012452457">Chhay and Huybrechts, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012452457">Bureau des Affaires Urbaines, 2007</xref>). This goes some of the way towards restoring Phnom Penh’s pre-war image as a city of tree-lined streets, which was held in high regard by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098012452457">Lee Kuan Yew (1967)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0042098012452457">6</xref></sup> However, according to Frederic Mauret, a French technical advisor involved in the master plan, the full restoration of this green image is unlikely, as too much of what was green space in the pre-war period is now privately held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012452457">Englund and Ryttar, 2008</xref>, p. 24). The plan recognises the potential of mobilising private East Asian capital to realise its vision, even in social housing in the central city, where it argues that the private sector could fill this void, if facilitated by government incentives. The plan remains unratified by the Council of Ministers and is still unpublished,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0042098012452457">7</xref></sup> with even the previously published summaries no longer available from the website of the Phnom Penh Municipal Government. This is despite having been approved by the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098012452457">Nielson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A similar pattern—where international development assistance in urban design and planning has lost influence after the completion of the project—can be seen in the case of Boeung Kak. In order to redevelop the area surrounding what was then a lake in the central city, an international design competition for the redevelopment of the area was organised by the PPMG with assistance from the French government. The winning entry was partly designed by Meng Bunnarith, then a PhD candidate at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, and now the Deputy Director of the Department of Urban Planning at MLMUPC. The redevelopment plan was summarily scrapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012452457">Hayman, 2009</xref>), as the contract for redevelopment was awarded to a private company owned by ruling party senator Lao Meng Khin in partnership with a Chinese state-owned company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098012452457">Ko, 2010</xref>). The original plan retained the majority of the lake’s water surface, a stark contrast to the current plan which has already seen the majority of the lake’s surface disappear.</p>
<p>This pattern of waning support for the goals of development projects following the cessation of project funding is common in Cambodia. The size of government budgets and the donor provision of salary supplements to government employees during the project makes post-project financial sustainability a recurring concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012452457">Godfrey <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). At the national level, this is more applicable to technical assistance and capacity building projects that are more commonly the focus of Western donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042098012452457">Sato <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) and less applicable to infrastructure projects that have been the more common focus of emerging donors such as China, Thailand, Korea and India. In Phnom Penh, the same applies to infrastructure projects that have been funded by Japanese development finance such as the improvements in drainage and flood protection, the construction of schools and government buildings, the restoration and construction of bridges and road upgrades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012452457">JICA 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>With the project funding having finished in 2005, full ratification of the 2020 master plan now seems highly unlikely, suggesting that senior members of the government are opposed to the plan or parts thereof. No public criticism of the plan has been made by members of the government and whatever debate has taken place happened behind closed doors. Wider public debate has been limited and is obviously difficult when the plan has never been made public. In an anonymous interview, a senior official at the MLMUPC pointed to a widespread frustration within the Ministry over the failure to ratify the plan due to the fact that those reviewing the plan at the Council of Ministers are not urban planning professionals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0042098012452457">8</xref></sup> A range of alternative views on the non-ratification of the plan were offered by various figures in advisory roles, in government and in the opposition party in Phnom Penh. These ranged from the Council of Ministers simply having other priorities, to there being a need to produce a more detailed plan due to the current plan being too broad and general and claims of high-ranking government officials blocking its passage due to not wanting restrictions placed on land that they personally own. Whatever its reason, the non-ratification of the plan has resulted in a degree of informality in urban planning in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>In spite of the plan not being ratified by the Council of Ministers, Ly Saveth, Director of Administration at PPMG, stated that the Municipality “still follows the master plan, and have done so since 2005”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0042098012452457">9</xref></sup> However, the following unratified, unpublished plan is fraught with difficulty. He went on to state that attempts to place restrictions on land use and land titling are easily contested due to the unofficial status of the plan and stated that its complete implementation is beyond the capacity of the PPMG. This is partly due to the fact that responsibility for the planning and governance of Phnom Penh is formally split between the PPMG and the MLMUPC. Large projects are explicitly outside the ambit of the Municipality, which is responsible for the approval of developments with a footprint smaller than 3000 square metres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042098012452457">The Royal Government of Cambodia, 1997</xref>, p. 3). The MLMUPC is responsible for larger sites as well as large agricultural projects and areas classified as, or surrounding, heritage sites.</p>

<title>Beneath the Bureaucracy: The Pervasiveness of Personal Relationships</title>
<p>The influence of these administrative divisions is accompanied by significant influence from powerful government figures. This is evident in the announcement of some of the largest private development projects. The Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has personally announced a number of private projects before official plans have been submitted to the PPMG and the MLMUPC. In a number of cases, private companies owned by members of the government have been awarded large development contracts without going to tender, as was the case with the Boeung Kak development. Such events are confirmation of the interdependence of the ruling party, the Cambodian state and the business élite. The ability of the ruling party to ‘get things done’ is dependent on large donations from businessmen, who in turn are dependent on the state for awarding land concessions, licences and contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012452457">Hughes, 2010</xref>). A recent case involved the donation of funds by the SOKIMEX Group, owned by businessman and ruling party senator Sok Kong, for the purchase of two sewerage trucks by the PPMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098012452457">Phnom Penh Capital Hall, 2011b</xref>). In some cases, it has been documented that the process of approving development and investment has been directly facilitated by Hun Sen personally advising Phnom Penh Governor Kep Chuktema to agree to proposals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098012452457">Kouth and O’Toole, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that this personal advice is being provided is not, in itself, remarkable. However, Hun Sen’s power is such that Kep Chuktema and the PPMG are highly unlikely to act in opposition to his wishes. Hun Sen’s personal intervention in local issues is not uncommon, as has been documented by Stephen Heder who described the Prime Minister’s personal power in 2010 as becoming “more concentrated, personalized, militarized, regal, and mystical” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012452457">Heder, 2011</xref>, p. 208). Still, even the power of Prime Minister Hun Sen and his ability to realise urban visions is limited by availability of funding. Beng Khemro, Deputy Director General at the MLMUPC described one such instance where one of Hun Sen’s recommendations was largely unrealised due to a lack of donor interest. Khemro stated that<disp-quote>
<p>very few donors took interest in the National Urban Development Strategy, because they tend to think that the problem in Cambodia is rural, rather than urban.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0042098012452457">10</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The concentration of Hun Sen’s personal power reflects a broader pattern of highly centralised government in Cambodia, with lower levels of government having little autonomy. This has been the case with the PPMG, although its autonomy has reportedly been improving since the implementation of a nation-wide decentralisation strategy in co-operation with UNDP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0042098012452457">11</xref></sup> According to a 1999 UNDP assessment, the municipality and its budget were then part of the Ministry of Interior. Municipal departments at City Hall were part of the respective line ministries, co-supervised by a Vice Governor and their parent ministry. Thus, many decisions affecting the municipality were made outside City Hall, at higher levels of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0042098012452457">UNDP and UNHCS, 1999</xref>). Following the Royal Government of Cambodia’s launch of the Strategic Framework for Decentralisation and Deconcentration Reform in 2005, the municipality has reportedly experienced greater levels of political and financial autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012452457">Meng, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012452457">Ministry of Interior, Royal Government of Cambodia, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042098012452457">Ros, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012452457">Khemro, 2006</xref>). Recent developments, including the establishment of the Phnom Penh Capital Council and the passing of a law on property tax have the potential to give the municipality significantly more political and financial autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098012452457">Phnom Penh Capital Hall, 2011c</xref>). This autonomy appears to be supported by the recent announcement by Hun Sen that<disp-quote>
<p>The Royal Government has clearly stated that Phnom Penh City Hall is the main player to rebuild and develop Phnom Penh city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0042098012452457">Sen, 2010</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, his subsequent announcement of the Chruy Changva City project prior to approval from City Hall highlights the limitations of this autonomy due to his continued involvement in recommending the approval of projects before formal submissions have been made.</p>
<p>To characterise the urban governance of Phnom Penh as disjointed may seem at odds with the broader characterisation of political power in Cambodia as highly centralised. However, the centralisation of political power does not translate to unified and integrated governance. Rather, administrative dysfunction has been primarily caused by the maintenance of the patronage system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0042098012452457">Sok, 2005</xref>; cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042098012452457">Slocomb, 2010</xref>). Hughes has argued that the ruling party has favoured the retention of bloated, poorly paid and poorly functioning organisations and resisted the rationalisation of the public service which has been encouraged by international donors. Rationalisation of the public service represents a threat to government interests, as a culture of meritocracy and professionalism might disable the ability of the government to use the civil service as the foundation of its sphere of discretionary action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012452457">Hughes, 2009</xref>, p. 160). Rationalisation of the public service is further hindered by cases where responsibility for particular areas of administration and policy has been allocated or awarded to a specific client—and, with it, the ability to take a share of associated profit. With status, political power and money so closely linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042098012452457">Slocomb, 2010</xref>), reform would require a serious shake-up of the patronage system.</p>
<p>Power struggles have also been evident within the ruling party, a situation that was detailed by the <italic>Phnom Penh Post</italic> in July 2011 following the release of leaked US embassy cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098012452457"><italic>Phnom Penh Post</italic>, 2011</xref>). The visibility of this factional tension was greater throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, when the faction led by Chea Sim—which also included Sar Kheng and Heng Samrin—was the strongest opponent to that of Prime Minister Hun Sen. The most public display of this tension came in July 2004 when, under pressure to sign legislation allowing the formation of government, Chea Sim’s residence was surrounded by military forces and Chea Sim briefly fled the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042098012452457">Slocomb, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0042098012452457">Springer, 2011</xref>). The power held by Chea Sim has seriously diminished and with it the size of the faction that he leads. Still, it appears that other divisions have emerged—Deputy Prime Minister and head of the Council of Ministers, Sok An was seen by many interview participants, including those working at the Council of Ministers, to wield comparable influence to Hun Sen and operate as a top-level patron, while not posing any direct threat to Hun Sen’s leadership.</p>
<p>A thorough analysis of the restructuring of political and economic power that has taken place in the municipality over the past decade is beyond the scope of this paper; however, this brief overview begins to illustrate the limited but improving autonomy of the municipality, the disjointed nature of urban governance in the city and the interaction and alliances between elements of the government and the development and private sectors. It is in this context that local and internationally funded private development projects are approved and international co-operation and assistance are established and take place. The processes involved in the approval of any individual project are significantly opaque with formal bureaucratic processes pervaded by personal relationships.</p>
<p>As has been demonstrated, ambitious foreign-led urban development assistance can be significantly thwarted, particularly in the case of policy development. In this context, the ambitious French-led project to create a new master plan for the city has been limited in its impact; the winning Boeung Kak redevelopment plan was scrapped; and the urban policy ambitions of Prime Minister Hun Sen have struggled to find interested donors. At the same time, the planning and development of large tracts of land are being undertaken by private developers. It is these private developers who have—or at least claim to have—the funding both to plan and to construct their visions. It is the visions of the private sector that display the most potential to realise government desires to enhance the position of Phnom Penh within their imagining of the world’s cities.</p>

<title>Worlding the City: Private-sector Planning in Phnom Penh</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Royal Government of Cambodia has transferred this country to be stable in both politic and economy; to particularly, Phnom Penh, the heart of the country has been well developing.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098012452457">Ananya Roy and Aihwa Ong (2011)</xref> have argued that aspects of city development throughout Asia can be understood through the theoretical framework of ‘worlding’—a process by which projects and practices situated in cities represent a vision of the world. Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and, with it, the emergence of numerous cities of international significance. This transformation takes place through the visual symbolism of the transformation of the built environment, where skyscrapers and ‘world class’ spaces are planned and constructed in order to project national claims to global significance. Through situated experiments that involve modelling and interreferencing amongst cities within the region, emergent cities in Asia are reinventing urban norms that are considered to be ‘global’. With this focus on the on-going “art of being global”, Roy and Ong do not seek to reference any established criteria of city achievements, but instead seek to shed light on<disp-quote>
<p>an array of often overlooked urban initiatives that compete for world recognition in the midst of inter-city rivalry and globalized contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098012452457">Ong, 2011</xref>, p. 2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While there is no overarching and explicit ‘worlding’ strategy in place, such transformations—or, at least, desires for such transformations—are evident in the marketing and design of many large private development projects in Phnom Penh. These developments are funded by private intra-Asian capital and include firms from Asian cities that can make much stronger claims to international significance. Many of these have been promoted by developers and the government as representing Phnom Penh’s emergence as a modern, connected city in the realms of international finance, or to establish a ‘global standard’ of living for prospective residents. These are patterns that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042098012452457">Gavin Shatkin (2011)</xref> has identified as common in the representation of edge-city projects by government and developers throughout Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0042098012452457">12</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Statements made by politicians indicate that, through the development of edge-city projects, it is expected that Phnom Penh will be established amongst its ASEAN peers. Coming from such a low base, the city is not making a claim to global significance, nor is it overtly engaging in intercity competition. The city’s economic and cultural influence, and position in broader imaginaries of international significance, is well below that of the Asia’s strongest urban economies such as Singapore, Shanghai and Dubai which often serve as aspirational models for urban development projects elsewhere in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012452457">Chua, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012452457">Choplin and Franck 2010</xref>). Further, the same applies to many of the cities that are home to initiatives that aspire to these models, such as Bangalore, São Paulo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012452457">Chua, 2011</xref>), Hyderabad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012452457">Bunnell and Das, 2010</xref>) and Mumbai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012452457">Huang, 2008</xref>). Phnom Penh appears to be staking a claim to being part of this process, without the overt expectation that it can effectively compete with other cities in the region.</p>
<p>Worlding practices are typically aspirational, experimental and often speculative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012452457">Goldman, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012452457">2011b</xref>). Many of these projects exist only as plans, with their planned locations currently vacant. Similar patterns can be seen throughout Asia and, as Shatkin has observed, for every one of these projects that breaks ground, “there are several more which have scarcely advanced beyond the concept stage, and in many cases likely never will” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042098012452457">Shatkin, 2011</xref>, p. 78). Many more are under construction, but have been stalled, with the enthusiasm of developers curbed by the global financial crisis and the associated slump in Phnom Penh’s real estate market as well as the more recent uncovering of financial scandals in South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042098012452457">Song, 2011</xref>). Phnom Penh’s skyscraper projects and large edge-city projects have encountered a range of problems from difficulties in financing, opposition from donors, protests against forced evictions and relocations and a lack of buyers and/or tenants. Thus, visions of Phnom Penh as a city of skyscrapers and ‘global’ edge-city projects are tentative and, at this stage, largely imaginary.</p>
<p>While there are many parallels with the development of cities throughout Asia, Phnom Penh and its private development projects are comparatively small by all conventional measures—of population, land area and finances. CamKo City is the largest of these projects to have broken ground. The entire project—of which just one of six phases has been partially completed—covers an area of just under 130 hectares. CamKo City is dwarfed by projects in neighbouring countries that cover thousands of hectares such as Hanoi North and Saigon South in Vietnam and Muang Thong Thani in Bangkok, Thailand. They are not significantly integrated in any broader city plan and do not involve any major transport infrastructure linking the projects to the central city or to each other—a notable shortcoming acknowledged in interviews with staff at both CamKo City and Grand Phnom Penh International City.</p>
<p>Chruy Changva City is the most recently announced, as well as the most expensive and most ambitious edge-city project listed for development in Phnom Penh. The draft development plan seeks to establish Phnom Penh amongst its ASEAN peers and features a 60-hectare botanic garden, an ‘international standard’ stadium, a 45-hectare ‘ASEAN Plus 5 Commercial City Zone’ and a 162-hectare ‘World Class Business Centre Zone’. It is Phnom Penh’s fifth large edge-city project, the others being Grand Phnom Penh International City, CamKo City, Diamond Island City and Boeung Kak Town. The 2020 master plan for Phnom Penh envisages ‘secondary centres’ that correspond in some degree to the location of these edge-city projects. However, their integration into the greater vision of the master plan is not readily apparent—a point to which I will return in the following section.</p>
<p>The most explicit ‘worlding’ project came out of an agreement made between the Royal Government of Cambodia and World City Co. Ltd on the co-development of a ‘Financial Development District’ (FDD) in CamKo City. The agreement seeks to establish Phnom Penh amongst the financial centres of the region, with the developers referring specifically to Singapore and Hong Kong.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0042098012452457">13</xref></sup> This agreement took place at the same time as negotiations between the Korea Exchange and the Royal Government of Cambodia for the joint establishment of the Cambodian Stock Exchange and followed the visit of then President of South Korea, Roh Moo-Hyun. At the time it was decided that CamKo would donate the building for the Cambodian Stock Exchange, a new building to house Phnom Penh’s City Hall and 15 hectares of land for the FDD.</p>
<p>The development is planned as a partnership between World City Co. Ltd and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Tax incentives are planned in order to attract global firms to take up space in the FDD.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0042098012452457">14</xref></sup> This was the last of three significant changes in the plan of CamKo City. The initial plan was a relatively unambitious shophouse development, which was revised as the developers saw the rapid change occurring in Phnom Penh and predicted that the popularity of shophouse developments would decline in the coming years. This plan was again revised on request from the Cambodian government to house the FDD and the Cambodian Stock Exchange. This apparently strong government–private-sector partnership is showing signs of failing, as it is becoming apparent that the Korean investors do not have access to the required capital. To date, no progress has been made on any of the aforementioned buildings and the Cambodian Stock Exchange opened in a tower in the central city in July 2011. Completion of the project looks increasingly unlikely as construction has been stalled since October 2010 and, in June 2011, the Korean bank that financed the project emerged as the subject of a wide-ranging corruption investigation by the South Korean government.</p>
<p>Compared with CamKo City and Chruy Changva City, there is much less evidence of government direction in the development and planning of Grand Phnom Penh International City. This was confirmed by an Indonesian member of the project’s Planning and Design Department, Haryanto Ong, who stated that only small modifications were made to the plan at the government’s request.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0042098012452457">15</xref></sup> Hence, it makes a much smaller contribution to ‘worlding’ the broader city, but is more representative of a desire to provide a ‘world class’ standard of living to its residents. Ciputra—the firm behind the project—has similar projects underway in Hanoi and Kolkata, each of which is characterised by near-identical horse-adorned double-arched gates. Its various residential offerings are named after cities in Europe and New York. The reference can be seen to some degree in their façades; however, the design of these buildings feels more comparable with wealthy villas elsewhere in South-east Asia. When questioned on this issue, a senior member of the planning and design team made no attempt to support the authenticity of these labels, dismissing the idea by stating that the name is just a name.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0042098012452457">16</xref></sup> A similar point was made by Ly Saveth of the PPMG, who stated that the ‘world’ or ‘international’ city marketing of Phnom Penh’s edge-city projects was at this stage, “just the name” but expected that more meaningful regional integration was not far off.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0042098012452457">17</xref></sup>

<p>The developers of Boeung Kak Town, Chruy Changva City and Diamond Island City are much less approachable and more opaque in their operations than CamKo City and Grand Phnom Penh International City. All appear to involve Cambodian and Chinese finance capital and expertise. In the case of Boeung Kak Town, this is explicit, whereas with Chruy Changva City and Diamond Island City both are being developed by Canadia Bank, a local bank headed by a Chinese Cambodian, Pung Kheav Se. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Overseas Cambodian Investment Corporation, which has been reported by the Cambodian government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098012452457">Ministry of Commerce, 2008</xref>) and the <italic>Phnom Penh Post</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012452457">Kunmakara, 2008</xref>) as being a Chinese investment group. The group does not have a website, so it is difficult to confirm these reports, but a Chinese-language brochure distributed at a function organised by the Cambodian delegation to Expo 2010 in Shanghai confirms this link, as well as the Chinese version of the name which translates as “<italic>China</italic> Overseas Cambodian Investment Corporation”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0042098012452457">18</xref></sup> Chinese media have reported that most Chinese investors in Cambodia are clients of Canadia Bank and that it is the first and only bank to lend to developers whose projects involve the relocation of ‘squatters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012452457">Kan, 2008</xref>). Boeung Kak Town and Diamond Island City have involved extensive relocations and forced evictions. Land acquisition for the Chruy Changva City project has not yet taken place, but an order is in place to prohibit new construction and the transfer of landownership in the proposed area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098012452457">Phnom Penh Capital Hall, 2011e</xref>).</p>
<p>While many of the urban development processes taking place in Phnom Penh appear familiar, the leaders of the city and the nation offer no clear reference as to their aspirations for Phnom Penh and what its future position in the world could be. Specific cities in the region are often cited as inspiration for particular projects, but comparisons are often superficial. As we have seen, the privatisation of planning in Phnom Penh reflects similar patterns in the region, where élite, privately developed urban spaces have been proposed—insulated from the disorder of the existing city. These developments reflect a privatised model of urban planning designed to further state goals of international economic integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042098012452457">Shatkin, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>They also follow the comparable patterns of interrupted and inconsistent progress, often involve widespread forced evictions and take place through partnerships between the state and private developers. These processes exist in the context of a fluid and ever-changing environment of foreign models interacting with local politics both visible and opaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098012452457">Labbé and Boudreau, 2011</xref>). The future of these projects is tentative, with the apparent collapse of funding for CamKo City casting doubt over the future of the most advanced project. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042098012452457">Shatkin (2011)</xref> has observed that—with the exception of China—even the most successful privately planned mega projects have failed to realise their ambitious goals. It remains to be seen whether the Chinese involvement in three of these edge-city projects will contribute to their progress and to Phnom Penh’s emergence as another exception to this trend.</p>

<title>Criticism, Contestation and Failure</title>
<p>These privately developed projects do not appear to be what the French advisers envisaged for Phnom Penh’s ‘secondary centres’. For Frederic Mauret, a French technical adviser for the 2020 master plan “those mega projects think only about the development in their locations, turning blind eyes on the development of the whole city” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098012452457">Mauret, 2008</xref>). He argues that “the City Hall cannot allow investors or developers to manage the development of the city. Otherwise, the future of the development of the city will be over.” Mauret’s views reflect a much broader association of privatisation of cities with urban dystopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012452457">Hogan <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). This dystopian view of privatisation does not appear to be shared by the Cambodian government, who have not heeded Mauret’s warnings. Numerous privately planned edge-city projects with their ‘worlding’ ambitions have been approved, while ratification of the 2020 master plan on which Mauret worked appears increasingly unlikely.</p>
<p>The summary of the master plan, and Mauret’s comments on the state of urban planning in Phnom Penh, reflect an assumption that policy-makers will mobilise private developers around a coherent and integrated vision of urban development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012452457">Chhay and Huybrechts, 2009</xref>). While the plan envisages the mobilisation of East Asian capital for the realisation of large urban planning and infrastructure projects, it envisages both public and private projects as being guided by its proposed land use and infrastructure plan. This assumption contrasts with the reality of urban development in Phnom Penh, where visions are often conceived outside the urban policy sphere by private developers and politically powerful élites. Equipped with an unratified master plan, the capacity of the formal bureaucracy to challenge large private developments or force them to conform to a broader vision is very limited. This lack of conformity means that each of the five edge-city projects is primarily planned with a separate vision, largely limited to the physical territory of the project. It is clear that their approval and, in some cases, close alliances with members of the government, represent a desire for ‘world class’ urban spaces on the part of the government. Yet this desire is planned as a series of implanted spaces on the edges of the existing city. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0042098012452457">Shatkin (2008)</xref> refers to a similar process in Metro Manila as ‘bypass-implant urbanism’ through which a diversified portfolio of integrated urban mega projects are linked by a growing network of rail and toll roads. Phnom Penh lacks the ‘bypass’ component, resulting in a vision that only involves a disconnected array of relatively isolated ‘implants’.</p>
<p>The PPMG has been actively encouraging investment in public transport in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012452457">Phnom Penh Capital Hall, 2011f</xref>). Following the introduction of direct flights between Paris and Phnom Penh, the PPMG is working with French donors on a feasibility study for the construction of a tramway between the airport and the central city. A larger study is being conducted in co-operation with the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) to revise an Urban Transport Master Plan that was produced by a JICA team in 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098012452457">Phnom Penh Capital Hall, 2011g</xref>). The PPMG has indicated that it expects public transport in the city to be privately operated; however, they understand that it will not be profitable and expect that it will need to be subsidised by the Municipality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0042098012452457">19</xref></sup> The willingness of intra-Asian investors to speculate on the development of ‘world class’ urban spaces on the edge of the city evidently does not extend to the development of public transport, where foreign donors continue to play the largest role. To date, public transport within the city remains informal, dominated by moto-taxis and <italic>tuk-tuks</italic>, and Phnom Penh’s edge-city projects remain relatively isolated from the central city.</p>
<p>Thus far, most challenges to these ‘implants’ by affected residents, civil society groups and foreign NGOs have not been strong enough to prevent land acquisition taking place, although they have, in some cases, resulted in improved resettlement conditions. A notable exception came when this general pattern was tested and successfully challenged by the World Bank, which in August 2011 suspended all new lending to the Cambodian government due to land disputes related the Boeung Kak New Town project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012452457"><italic>Phnom Penh Post</italic>, 2008</xref>). After initial posturing by the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0042098012452457"><italic>Voice of America</italic>, 2011</xref>), the resumption of loans was negotiated in return for the allocation of 12.4 hectares of land for the on-site relocation of affected residents.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the region, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0042098012452457">Shatkin (2008)</xref> has described the limited efficacy of the state in realising the development of urban mega projects. In cases that involve the conversion of agricultural land and the off-site relocation of large numbers of residents, popular opposition to state-sanctioned developments may be strengthened by the reality of the threat of being punished at the ballot box. This threat is much weaker in the Cambodian context, where the urban poor are greatly outnumbered by the rural population, who have consistently returned the ruling party to office with increased majorities. At least in terms of land acquisition, the strength of the Cambodian state is such that this incident of compromise in the land acquisition process is an exception. Further, the action required to bring about this revision has only been made possible by the threat of a complete cessation of loans from the World Bank after popular protests and political opposition failed to sway the authorities.</p>
<p>With respect to the ‘worlding’ framework advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098012452457">Roy and Ong (2011)</xref>, Phnom Penh exists on the periphery—it is far from being a major influence in the redefinition of what it means to be ‘global’ within Asia. The cases examined in Roy and Ong’s edited volume focus primarily on Chinese and Indian cities, with Dubai and Singapore also referenced throughout. The spectacular rise of skylines across Asia in mega cities such as Shanghai and Dubai has been seen to symbolise the spectacular urban growth of Asia, which is now home to approximately half of the world’s urban population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0042098012452457">UNFPA, 2007</xref>). Yet these mega cities are exceptions—less than ten per cent of the world’s urban population live in cities with populations of 10 million or more, compared with almost 25 per cent living in cities with populations of between one and five million; the majority of the world’s urban population live in cities with less than one million inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0042098012452457">UNFPA, 2007</xref>, p. 10). This pattern is expected to continue in Asia, where it is predicted that, in the coming decades, growth will be strongest in these smaller cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098012452457">Cohen, 2004</xref>). Analyses of these smaller cities are key to understanding the state of urbanism throughout Asia and the world. This void is partially filled by a recent special issue of <italic>Planning Theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042098012452457">Roy, 2011</xref>) which begins to shed light on ‘worlding’ practices in smaller cities such as Kabul and Bogotá. Yet still, the contemporary development of cities of this size, and particularly that of the smaller cities of South-east Asia’s poorest nations, remains under-researched.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As we have seen, the contemporary development of Phnom Penh—the capital of one of the poorest countries in South-east Asia—has many parallels in the urban transformations taking place throughout the region and speaks significantly to recent developments in urban theory. Yet Phnom Penh differs from most of the region’s capitals and major cities for its small size (economy, population and land area) and for the large amount of financial involvement of both foreign direct investment and Western donors, relative to state budgets. State actors negotiate relationships and undertake projects with private and development-sector partners, without any strong coherence to an explicit city-wide vision. The strength and centrality of the Cambodian state in planning and developing the city are undeniable. Yet the role of the state is unclear and this is not simply due to the emergence of privately planned urban infrastructure. Internal power structures are shrouded in ambiguity, overlapping with the private business interests of political élites, financial enticement for both individuals and institutions, and informal networks of political power. These networks lie beneath the formal bureaucratic veneer and ultimately drive the privately funded mega projects that seek to improve Phnom Penh’s image in the world, while subverting the ambitious master plan that was funded by development capital.</p>
<p>Compared with other cities in the region, the role of development-sector actors has been particularly ambitious. This has been most marked in the production of a master plan intended to restrict the actions of both private and public development projects. In partnership with the municipal government, the French-led team were ultimately thwarted in their efforts to establish a coherent and overarching vision of urban development aimed at ‘fixing’ the administration and governance of the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0042098012452457">20</xref></sup> While the plan recognises the importance of mobilising East Asian capital for the realisation of urban projects, it appears that it was overoptimistic in its ambition to integrate these developments into a coherent urban vision. Aspects of the plan have already been overridden by private projects funded by East Asian capital in partnership with government actors.</p>
<p>In tracing these themes, it has been my intention in this paper to contribute to the on-going unsettling of existing geographies of urban theory and policy knowledge by positioning Phnom Penh within a ‘world of cities’. This moves against a tendency to position imaginings of city-ness in Europe and North America, and demonstrates the power of intra-Asian mobilities in the development of the Phnom Penh. Far from the cutting edge of global urbanism, we see aspirations and developments that are comparable with those that have been described in recent urban analyses of cities throughout South-east Asia and beyond. Yet Phnom Penh’s imagined position and influence in this ‘world of cities’ is far below that of the oft-cited exemplary cases within the global South.</p>
<p>With this in mind, and following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042098012452457">Ananya Roy (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098012452457">Jennifer Robinson (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098012452457">2006)</xref>, I argue that smaller and less influential cities like Phnom Penh need to be treated seriously in the production of urban theory. While the region’s most powerful cities vie for global economic and cultural influence, a wealth of smaller cities, like Phnom Penh, seek to better their position in the world, while remaining far from the cutting edge of global urbanism. In order to understand urbanism throughout Asia and throughout the world, much more attention needs to be paid to these smaller cities, where most of the world’s urban dwellers reside.</p>
