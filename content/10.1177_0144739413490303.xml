<abstract>
<p>This article considers the ways in which we might use group activities to more effectively introduce some key problems of conformity and obedience to authority. Using some of the classic psychology experiments conducted by Asch and Milgram might open up more critical reflection on the ways groups behave and our own tendencies to look to fit in and avoid conflict.</p>

<p>The psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a number of famous experiments on questions of conformity in groups. He was interested in the way individuals respond to the behaviour of others. The subject of an experiment, confronted with a simple visual test involving the lengths of lines on paper, conforms to the responses of others even where they are clearly wrong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0144739413490303">Asch, 1956</xref>). Observed in a lift with a number of people who are acting as part of the experiment, subjects can be seen to respond to their actions. As the actors turn, in unison, to the left or to face the rear of the lift, so does the subject. As they remove their hats, so does the subject. The confusion and, in some cases, discomfort is evident on the faces of the subjects, but they conform nevertheless. These experiments have been replicated many times and in many locations, and we see it in the behaviours of our students on a regular basis. This article will explore some of the ways in which we might bring a deliberate focus on conformity into teaching with students working in groups.</p>
<p>Programme aims and learning objectives will, almost universally, include some element of working in teams. Where these group exercises and tasks are not assessed, perhaps formative, they can be useful ways of engaging students in challenging and developing each other. They occupy some time during and between classes and can build a sense of a cohort of students working together to give of their best. However, when a group task is assessed, the atmosphere in a classroom can almost tangibly change. We will all have tried different approaches to structuring groups, rewarding members differentially and allowing some element of peer assessment. But problems remain and it is not always clear that students learn what we might hope for from the exercise. This article will suggest that, alongside the more common focus on free-riding and similar behaviour in groups, we should also consider the problem of conformity in group settings.</p>
<sec id="section1-0144739413490303">
<title>Some student experiences</title>
<p>For a number of years, I have run modules with a substantial element of assessed group work. The format has developed over time, with changes to the way the groups were selected (self-selection or by some “objective” criteria), to the weighting of a self/team assessment element of the marking and to the way in which class discussion of group dynamics has been a feature of the module. I propose to briefly reflect on the dynamics in two groups taking part in the same module before returning to the question of conformity.</p>
<p>The module was concerned with ideas of governance and partnership working. Seven students in each group were drawn from four different public agencies in the same city region. From a previous module, each group member had some awareness of their own personal preferences and behaviours, as reflected in Myers-Briggs Type Indicators and Learning Styles assessment tools. The students were also drawn from two different intakes. One was a group of middle managers with a number of years’ experience in public services. Their experience of education was varied, not all having first degrees, and remote in terms of time. The other was a cohort of graduate trainees, much younger in years and with less experience in public services. All of the trainees had recently completed their first degrees and one had a further postgraduate qualification. In each group there was a mixture of age (from 23 to 52) and experience, gender (in each group, there were two male and five female students), personality types and organisations. As such, the groups are particular in their make-up. They do not, in any sense, reflect the profiles of the employees of the local agencies or of the wider population. Rather, the profiles emerged as a result of the ways in which the two cohorts were recruited by their employers. Though unrepresentative in some broader sense, the groups nevertheless brought together very different individuals with particular experiences and, for the purposes of this article, the point of interest is the way the groups sought to handle the differences and disagreements that were an inevitable aspect of the collective task.</p>
<p>The module formed a core element of the second year of a part-time Masters programme. However, the first year of study had differed for each cohort. The graduate trainees’ first year sought to support their early introduction to public services, helping them understand the political context in which they were now working and the dynamics common to public service agencies. For the middle managers, the first year had concentrated on reflection on their experiences in public service, drawing on street-level bureaucracy as a core concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0144739413490303">Rowe, 2012</xref>). Some opportunities to learn together were afforded by guest speakers, student presentations and participation in an International Summer School. While not all had taken up these opportunities, the majority of each group had done so.</p>
<p>As part of the core module, all students had participated in class discussions about the problems of working in groups, the dynamics that can emerge and the ways in which they might manage these potential pitfalls. Each group was then tasked to undertake research over a period of five months and then to report on a current question affecting each of their agencies and reflect on the degree to which experiences were shared, and solutions might be also. In addition, each group member was then tasked with writing an individual reflective account on the process and their learning about the behaviour of individuals within groups.</p>
<p>Group A suffered from student absences from the very outset. In part, this was due to serious ill-health and was unavoidable, but the disruption affected dynamics throughout the course of the module. The rest settled on a topic and set about gathering data, but with one of the four agencies not actively involved, progress was slow and hesitant. Those absent at the outset were reluctant to question the decisions taken and the progress made. Instead, conscious of their absence at the outset, they sought to make up for it with enthusiasm and effort. And so the group continued on its path, despite a growing sense that they needed to review their earlier decisions. Having at the outset decided to have an egalitarian structure, with responsibilities divided equally between team members, one group member began to take charge and to martial the evidence into some form of a final report. By this point, the indicator of success for the group had become the harmonious and successful submission of an agreed report. Their subsequent reflective essays indicated that almost all members of the group were unhappy with the course they had chosen and with their end product.</p>
<p>In similar fashion, Group B did not select a leader. However, some participants expected one of the more senior (whether judged by age or experience) members of the team to take a lead, while those senior members, in private, were of the view that the exercise was an opportunity for the younger members to develop. They set about their separate tasks and, as the deadlines loomed large, began to realise that there was nobody pulling it all together. In fact, some of the more experienced staff were not even doing their own assigned tasks, being distracted by pressures at work, redundancies and caring responsibilities. Some heated exchanges developed and offensive remarks were exchanged. While a report was submitted on time, the individual reflective pieces revealed some deeply felt animosity arising from serious misunderstandings. Those team members who showed some awareness of these dynamics had not acted on this insight.</p>
<p>These are not extreme stories. Indeed, I would suggest, they are fairly typical of the experience of students in group exercises. While our attention is focused upon the problem of the students who do not commit the time and effort that others expect, we do not pick up on other aspects of group dynamics that are inherent to us as humans. When working with others, we like to fit in, to conform, to avoid conflict and to get on well together. We do this despite feeling, as individuals, that the course on which we may be embarked or the decisions we are taking are the wrong ones. Indeed, we see the harmony of the group as evidence of its effectiveness. However, if in doing so we ignore fundamental differences and disagreements, the harmony will be only superficial. Focusing upon the contribution of conflict and disharmony in the functioning of groups might be as useful a focus of teaching as the attention we pay to the free-rider problem. It is to the ways in which we might do this that I will now turn.</p>

<title>Misunderstanding agreement</title>
<p>While Asch’s experiments were concerned with the tendency to conform, other social psychologists have examined the problem of agreement. While no social psychologist, I have found particular value in the idea of pluralistic ignorance. When a crime takes place in full view of a number of onlookers, but nobody intervenes, we reach quick judgements about the failures of modern society, that we can be so unconcerned at the fate of our fellow humans. However, when examined more closely, it appears that the failure to act is the product of misunderstandings. Each onlooker may see the scene they are witnessing for what it is, a crime. However, they conclude that their interpretation is incorrect because nobody else has responded. Each onlooker assumes that all the other onlookers have a different interpretation and have better judgement for, if they too are witness to a crime, why are they not responding? Indeed, they all assume that someone else should take the initiative. This phenomenon, known as pluralistic ignorance, is more pronounced the more witnesses there are. In smaller numbers, one person is more likely to act and, in doing so, break the pattern. In larger groups, it just takes one person to act for all to respond – but that one person is under tremendous pressure to conform, much as we saw in Asch’s experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0144739413490303">Halbesleben et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0144739413490303">Miller and McFarland, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0144739413490303">Morrison and Milliken, 2000</xref>). So, while all might be in agreement, each misinterprets the behaviour of others and believes that they hold views at odds with everyone else. In our Group A, nobody wanted to challenge the course that had been selected at an early stage, all apparently convinced that they were alone in their sense that they were going astray.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0144739413490303">Harvey (1988</xref>) presents a different perspective on this phenomenon of misunderstanding in groups. Describing a family gathering on a hot summer afternoon, he recounts the series of misunderstandings that lead four contented people to go on an uncomfortable journey that nobody wanted to make. Each makes assumptions about the wishes and behaviours of the others and, in turn, misrepresents their own wishes in order to conform. Each then blames the others for the misery of their journey. In this case, the tensions are resolved. However, in many organisational settings, misunderstandings and blame might linger and remain a cause for animosity and resentment for some time. In our Group B, the more experienced members made assumptions about the needs of the junior, and vice versa, leading the group in a direction that nobody wanted to travel. These tensions were not recognised during the course of the module as happened in the story of the trip to Abilene. Instead, they resulted in arguments and heated exchanges which, to some degree, lingered on.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking about the problems of agreement and conformity, the students were more concerned with equity in workload and the free-rider problem. Each was more concerned either with appearing to contribute, after a slow start for some in Group A, or with challenging perceived shortcomings and idleness in Group B. Even where a problem was recognised, the problem was associated more with models of rational choice (in Group B, it was assumed that some students were shirking and allowing others to carry them). This focus on rationality might well fit with other aspects of a public administration programme, having clear connections with debates about governance or about performance management. Indeed, the use of group assignments to illustrate the problems of managing the performance of others is integral to much of my own teaching. However, shifting the focus of attention to the problems of conformity and agreement in groups offers a different way of challenging students to reflect on their own behaviour and that of other group members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0144739413490303">
<title>A point of departure</title>
<p>Much as questions of rational choice connect to other dimensions of many public administration programmes, a discussion of aspects of social psychology offers an opportunity to bring other subjects to the classroom. In particular, it prompts debate about effective ways to challenge others, to raise difficult questions and to think about questions of whistleblowing. It offers alternative interpretations of cases that otherwise make little sense. So, for example, UK readers will be familiar with widespread problems at the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0144739413490303">Healthcare Commission, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0144739413490303">The Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Inquiry, 2013</xref>). In brief, failures in management and care are estimated to have resulted in as many as 400 more deaths per annum than might be expected in other hospitals. Failings included unqualified staff making medical judgements, lack of nursing staff, an obsession with financial and other performance indicators and an exclusive focus upon achievement of independent Foundation Trust status. This case raises difficult questions about the culture in the organisation that allowed apparently obvious problems to go unchallenged for months and years. How could managers and staff work in that environment and not ask questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0144739413490303">Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0144739413490303">Heffernan, 2011</xref>)? How would we behave? These questions are a big step on from the discussion of student group behaviour, but they begin to touch upon some of the aspects of working in large organisations that should trouble us and our students.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0144739413490303">Milgram (1963</xref>) famously conducted experiments in which, on the instructions of someone apparently in authority, subjects “administered” electric shocks as a punishment to another person. Even when the doses were apparently causing pain or even death, subjects continued to administer the shocks as instructed. Milgram’s conclusions highlight the conflict in individuals between two dispositions: the desire not to cause harm; and the tendency to obey those in authority.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0144739413490303">1</xref>
</sup> More controversially, the Stanford Prison Experiment, leaving aside some of the questions about research methods and ethics, suggested that individuals conform to role expectations with which they might personally be uncomfortable. Donning the uniform of a prison warder turned otherwise liberal college students into bullies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0144739413490303">Zimbardo, 2007</xref>). In essence, these experiments suggest that the tendencies to conform and to fit in are pervasive. Being aware of this tendency in student group exercises opens up the potential for discussion with students about the necessary (psychological) resources to avoid or resist the tendencies.</p>
<p>However, there is less clarity about how to address this challenge. Asch acknowledged the need to better understand those who resisted the pressure of the majority:<disp-quote>
<p>Social opposition of the kind referred to is an ordeal because it exposes the individual to misunderstanding, calumny, or ostracism. Differences in endurance are therefore differences in capacity to withstand social misunderstanding or suspicion. (1956: 51)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, his experiments offered little evidence to better understand these differences in endurance. Similarly, Milgram and others have asked what makes some comply while others resist authority. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0144739413490303">Cohen (2001</xref>), in his study of the denial of suffering and atrocities, discusses the problem of a failure to acknowledge a truth staring us in the face. Denial, he suggests, is not aberrant but everyday. For him, the question is not why we do not act but why do we ever act? Instead of denial, he suggests we consider acknowledgement as the opposite. He refers to ideas of self-knowledge, moral witness, whistleblowing and living outside the lie as ways to attune the individual to suffering, acknowledging that this in turn carries risks for the individual left constantly raw. As for actions, we might look to altruism, pro-social behaviour or ideas of positive morality. But, most concrete of all, education is critical in the development of resilience, of acknowledgement and of an awareness of the ways we respond to conformity, to authority and to the suffering of others. Enabling students to question and challenge, indeed encouraging them to do so in ways that are constructive, might also be an important aspect of any personal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0144739413490303">Schon, 1983</xref>). Zimbardo has begun in recent years to make good use of the Stanford Prison Experiment to challenge behaviours evident in, for example, Abu Ghraib in Iraq, and to develop resources that encourage different behaviours.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0144739413490303">2</xref>
</sup> But, for the present article, the question must be what we can do in our approach to teaching public administration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0144739413490303">
<title>Rethinking group exercises</title>
<p>Explicitly discussing the evidence from Asch’s conformity experiments and Milgram’s obedience experiments offers a ready way into the discussion of other psychological phenomena, including pluralistic ignorance and the Abilene paradox. The experiments are well known and we might even be amused by the video material that is widely available. However, it is too easy for students to think that they would not comply so easily, that they would resist the pressures of the majority or of authority. It is experience and reflection on that experience, in however small a way and however safe an environment, that offer opportunities for students to consider their own conduct. The value of reflecting on behaviours is evident in the conduct of Groups A and B. In each group, at least five of the students had been to Auschwitz as part of the International Summer School. We had discussed some of the debates about conformity, the role of bureaucrats in the machinery of the Holocaust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0144739413490303">Arendt, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0144739413490303">Funnel, 1998</xref>), and the problem of standing out in a hostile environment and against all authority. But these discussions and reflections, profound as they were in their own ways, did not translate into thinking about their own behaviour in the everyday.</p>
<p>Whether the lessons of the way they acted in a group will have a lasting impact and result in a deeply reflexive awareness of their own conduct is hard to say. Indeed, the design of the group exercise might well be developed further to play on these dynamics more deliberately and to better draw out such lessons as a contribution to the development of Cohen’s acknowledgment. We might wish for a different balance within the groups, in terms of age, experience or gender, but the concerns do not arise from these imbalances. My concern would be with the learning derived from the experience. For all the input (social psychology resources, psychometric tests, a visit to Auschwitz) that we believed underpinned the module, there was nobody in either group who took this learning into the exercise. Those individuals who, in their reflective essays, asked questions of the group dynamics, did so in the relative safety of their written work. They did not speak up and challenge in a context where such behaviour, they might expect, would be encouraged and even rewarded. In one-to-one sessions with students, I raised these issues and challenged them to reflect on their thinking and behaviour. However, we were all left with the sense that nobody got the most out of the module. The reports were limited in their scope and in the critical examination of the practice. Students didn’t use the opportunity to learn to express their honest views and challenge others in a constructive manner. As tutors, colleagues and I felt we had missed an opportunity to make reflection on conformity a key learning outcome. How to reinforce the message, that questioning and challenging are positive contributions to the workings of teams and organisations, is a problem for us as educators just as much as it confronts managers in the NHS and elsewhere. There is no easy answer to this but, in our modules and assessments, we might look to make these problems and dynamics an explicit part of our discussions at every opportunity.</p>
