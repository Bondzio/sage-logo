<p>How does Michael Mann’s work compare with that of Marx and Weber? Let’s just say if you want to read the best that sociologists have done to encompass the driving forces of world history, the four volumes of <italic>The Sources of Social Power</italic> are more informative than the volumes of <italic>Capital</italic> and the <italic>Grundrisse</italic>. Can we say the same about Weber’s <italic>Economy and Society</italic> and his comparative studies of the world religions?</p>
<p>Marx and Engels were pioneers. They knew much less about social, political, and economic history than we do now. All scholarship is collaborative, and all the great macro-sociologists drew on the accumulated research of their age; Mann has the advantage of drawing on 150 years of increasing sophistication by thousands of specialists. Marx and Engels made a heroic effort to capture the main dynamic—in their great simplification, history is the history of economic class conflict. Classes are formed by changes in the means of economic production, which break through the traditionalistic drag of state, property law, and the ideological-cultural superstructure, in a series of revolutions.</p>
<p>For Mann, the world is multi-causal, but its dynamics can be grasped in four dimensions or structures, any of which can be the leading edge in particular historical periods. Along with modern scholarship, Mann recognizes that transformative political revolutions have not been driven primarily by economic grievances from below but start with state breakdown at the top—that is to say, the main dynamic is in the political realm. Mann also has the advantage of getting rid of the concept of a society (or “social formation”) as the unit of analysis. Mann’s four power-structures not only have distinctive causal force but are overlapping networks of different sizes. In Volume One, the ideological network is the leading edge of change in the ancient world, when universalistic religions spread as networks of recruitment, and of emotional/ritual techniques of solidarity and impressiveness. Military and diplomatic networks of relations—the geopolitical dimension—also dominated in the medieval period and at the transition to modernity. Both dimensions are, so to speak, global—affecting local social arrangements from the outside in.</p>
<p>The economic network in the form of capitalism became the leading edge only in a specific period: when several power networks connected into what Mann calls a crystalization, in this case the nation-state, from which the misleading concept of a “society” as a self-regulating unit was formulated by the early sociologists.</p>
<p>Now to Max Weber. <italic>Economy and Society</italic> was written as an encyclopedia of concepts, not a sequential account of world history, although it was to provide the elements for such an account. And Weber’s world religion volumes are more static than dynamic. Can we say that Mann uses Weber’s building blocks and writes the narrative that Weber envisioned? But Weber thought in Neo-Kantian ideal types, tweezers between which to locate the irreparably particularistic events of history. Mann’s four dimensions are more than ideal types, but real processes with real causal force. Weber was more typologist than causal theorist—the Linnaeus of sociology, where Marx attempted to be its Darwin.</p>
<p>Obviously, Mann’s four dimensions draw upon Weber’s three dimensions of stratification (class, status, and power) splitting the latter into infrastructural power (internal politics) and military geopolitics, giving each a distinctive causal pattern.</p>
<p>Another aspect that Mann builds upon is Weber’s insight that the major transition in modern history is from patrimonial to bureaucratic organization. Traditional society was organized around kin-based households, the more powerful ones full of servants, soldiers, and hangers-on; what passed for a state was a military alliance network among the more powerful households. The shift to the bureaucratic state introduced impersonal recruitment and practices of accountability and control. Bureaucracy separated itself from households, thereby creating modern concerns both for privacy and for corruption. Bureaucracy built the apparatus of abstract legal regulation that is one of the ingredients for self-expanding capitalism. Mann is part of the movement of historical sociologists (with Charles Tilly and Norbert Elias, among others) who developed a state-centered theory of modernity. The initial moving force was the military/fiscal revolution. Competition among European warlords resulted in bigger and more expensive armies, with the winners centrally recruited, paid, trained, and supplied. A military elimination contest built the bureaucratic state.</p>
<p>This initially external, geopolitical dynamic has consequences for infrastructural power. Tax collection bureaucracy expands and penetrates society, breaking down the walls of self-contained patrimonial households. One offshoot of this process was the wave of political revolutions, mobilized initially by tax resistance and defense of local privilege. But also, Mann and Tilly show, state penetration produces the conditions for modern politics. Groups become mobilized to get control of the centralized state, or at least to influence it; state bureaucracy created initially for military and tax purposes now can be turned to all kinds of causes, Left and Right. This is also the advent of the modern social movement: instead of ephemeral local protests, now widely-recruiting organizations mount long-term campaigns, putting pressure upon the center. Mann’s major insight is that class conflict, nationalism, ethnic, fundamentalist, reformist, and other mobilizations all take place simultaneously and by the same structural conditions. Thus what appear to be bizarre aberrations from the point of view of Marxist evolutionism, such as the Fascist movements, are themselves part of the array of modernist mobilizations, and continue to be future possibilities. Islamist militants are a current variety, we can infer, equally an offspring of the social movement revolution.</p>
<p>The basic pattern is laid down by the time of Volume Two. In the last two volumes, we see the twentieth century as an era of massive social movement mobilization, punctuated above all by the transforming effects of wars. Wars increase state penetration but also stress and destroy some regimes, opening up opportunities for further movement mobilization. After the world wars, the twentieth century became a gridlock of social movements. A key point in Volume Four is that the upsurge of identity politics continues the modernist pattern, pressuring states to engineer solutions to all social problems. But the so-called “new social movements,” along with their right-wing equivalents, have the effect of occluding class identities and class conflict. Mann, comparing the successes and failures of Social Democracy, points out that it is in the parts of the world where class-based politics have been strongest that equality has been most nearly attained. The United States has become the great example of the opposite.</p>
<p>Mann’s sociological vision is the clearest and best-organized to do justice to the complexity of the historical world. It is also unflinchingly realistic—no utopian goal of history, no progressive liberalization. Everything that has been gained has been fought for, and the conflicts are messy. Perhaps better than anyone, Mann looks everything in its face. His volume, <italic>The Dark Side of Democracy</italic>, which like his book on Fascisms is an offshoot from Volume Three and Four, sees the impulse of popular democracy in the genocidal killings that have marked modern times. Max Weber famously said, “I want to see how much I can take.” Michael Mann gives the answer: a hell of a lot.</p>
