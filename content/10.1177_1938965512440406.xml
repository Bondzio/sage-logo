<p>Earlier this year, the Cornell School of Hotel Administration organized the first Cornell International Hospitality Summit India, held in Mumbai. The event included a “Dean’s Leadership Panel,” comprising several of Asia’s top hospitality leaders who addressed the continent’s current issues. Representatives came from the Apeejay Surrendra Group; Leela Group; Lemon Tree Hotel Company; and Taj Hotels, Resorts, and Palaces. Following the dean’s panel, the Center for Hospitality Research offered an industry roundtable that addressed issues surrounding customer value and the rapidly changing dimensions of hotel distribution, with a particular focus on the influence of internet sites and social media.</p>
<p>Although roundtable participants’ presentations occurred in the context of India’s hotel industry, I was struck by the fact that much of this discussion could have occurred almost anywhere in the world, with an entirely different set of hoteliers. Yet the issues and solutions presented at any of these theoretical roundtables would be very similar to those of India’s hotel industry. Not only that, but the solutions being employed by India’s hoteliers for their local challenges are almost certainly applicable to operations everywhere.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is that many of India’s hotel companies are themselves global operators. What we are seeing in this century is an evolution of globalization. Whereas the twentieth-century version of globalization generally meant that North American and European companies expanded to Asia and Africa, now globalization operates in all directions. While it is true that this trend began with a few operators in the past century, we now have a different kind of worldwide web, in which hotel operators based in diverse nations have hotels located all around the globe.</p>
<p>This is an excellent development, because each nation and each culture has something to share regarding how to best operate a hotel and to provide the value that customers seek. You see the effects of this new-style globalization here in the pages of the <italic>CQ</italic>, as an increasing number of articles come from international authors who are sharing research that will benefit the entire hospitality industry. Likewise, the Center for Hospitality Research has increasing engaged international authors and will continue to do so.</p>
