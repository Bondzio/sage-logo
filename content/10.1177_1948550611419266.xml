<abstract>
<p>The omnipresent abstract symbol for time progression and regression is clockwise versus counterclockwise rotation. It was tested whether merely executing and seeing clockwise (vs. counterclockwise) movements would induce psychological states of temporal progression (vs. regression) and according to motivational orientations toward the future and novelty (vs. the past and familiarity). Supporting this hypothesis, participants who turned cranks counterclockwise preferred familiar over novel stimuli, but participants who turned cranks clockwise preferred novel over old stimuli, reversing the classic mere exposure effect (Experiment 1). Also, participants rotating a cylinder clockwise reported higher scores in the personality measure openness to experience than participants rotating counterclockwise (Experiment 2). Merely passively watching a rotating square had similar but weaker effects on exposure and openness (Experiment 3). Finally, participants chose more unconventional candies from a clockwise than from a counterclockwise Lazy Susan, that is, a turntable (Experiment 4).</p>

<body>
<p>The mental representation of time heavily draws on spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611419266">Boroditsky, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611419266">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611419266">Casasanto &amp; Boroditsky, 2008</xref>). For instance, the succession from past to future events can be mentally organized from left to right or from back to front relative to one’s own body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611419266">Casasanto &amp; Boroditsky, 2008</xref>). Beyond these visual representations, time–space mappings can even involve bodily (i.e., sensorimotor) components: when we think of the future, we slightly lean forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611419266">Miles, Nind, &amp; Macrae, 2010</xref>) and being apparently moved forward makes us think of the future in turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611419266">Miles, Karpinska, Lumsden, &amp; Macrae, 2010</xref>). Thus, the abstract concept of time is multimodally represented (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611419266">Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond such static time–space mappings, dynamic time symbols may also exist. One universal example for this is the rotational direction of clock hands. Clockwise movement indicates time passing by, thus progression to the future; whereas counterclockwise movement indicates reversal of time, and thus regression to the past. This assignment of meaning is arbitrary and only due to the historic fact that the predecessors of modern clocks, namely sundials, were invented in the northern hemisphere where in the course of the day the sun’s path across the sky is clockwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611419266">Rohr, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the association of clockwise/progression and counterclockwise/regression is a universal perceptual symbol (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611419266">Barsalou, 1999</xref>), for instance, on analog clocks or the “recycling symbol.” Beyond these merely visual cases, rotational direction has become a ubiquitous motion metaphor involving our own body movements, such as when we operate iPods, the car ignition, the volume control, or a can opener (Zwaan &amp; Taylor, 2006). In all these cases, a clockwise rotation signifies a progression toward the current goal or the tool’s purpose. This is even true for many cases that seem contradictory or disputable at first sight. For instance, to open a bottle and get the drink, we have to turn the bottle cap in a counterclockwise direction. However, for caps being closure mechanisms (similar to screws) again the clockwise turning direction indicates a progression toward its functional purpose, namely, closing the bottle or tightening a connection.</p>
<p>Thus, the abstract spatial movement feature of rotational direction is linked with progression/regression by massive sensorimotor experience during everyday life, including visual (e.g., clocks) and motor (e.g., operating a volume control) representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611419266">Barsalou, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611419266">Boroditsky, 2001</xref>). Thus, the question is whether rotational direction—perceptually and or motorically—might activate respective future- and past-related orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611419266">Boroditsky, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611419266">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611419266">Casasanto &amp; Boroditsky, 2008</xref>) and thus trigger psychological states of temporal progression and regression. Such states may shape psychological processes beyond mere thought content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611419266">Gilbert &amp; Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611419266">Miles, Karpinska, et al., 2010</xref>) and may involve whole motivational orientations and attitudes toward the past and the future, as outlined in the following.</p>
<p>An essential psychological corollary of progression in time is the experience of novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611419266">James, 1890</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611419266">Kant, 1929</xref>), while regression to the past is a return to the old and familiar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611419266">Freud, 1965</xref>). Because particularly heading toward the future essentially requires dealing with novel events and experiences, a progressive compared to a regressive mind-set should necessarily entail a novelty orientation, that is, a preference for novel stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611419266">Bardo, Donohew, &amp; Harrington, 1996</xref>; cf., novelty seeking, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611419266">Roberti, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611419266">Zuckerman, 1984</xref>). Consequently, if clockwise/counterclockwise rotation induces progression (vs. regression), then clockwise compared to counterclockwise rotation should increase novelty preference, functioning like a cognitive tuning (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611419266">Mavis, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611419266">Schwarz, 2002</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611419266">Smallwood &amp; Schooler, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The present studies tested this hypothesis. As inductions of rotational direction, we used both motor (Experiments 1 and 2) and visual (Experiment 3) instantiations because the mapping between rotational and temporal direction seems multimodal (see above). To avoid conscious clock-related associations (e.g., by a dot moving circularly), we used inductions featuring the smallest possible similarity with clocks, for instance turning cranks, or a rotating square. As dependent variables, we assessed different motivational and behavioral measures of novelty orientation, namely, preference for familiar versus novel stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611419266">Zajonc, 1968</xref>), self-reported openness to novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611419266">McCrae, 1996</xref>), as well as overt exploration behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611419266">Berlyne, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611419266">Hughes, 1997</xref>), to demonstrate the breadth of the present effect.</p>
<sec id="section1-1948550611419266">
<title>Experiment 1: Preference for Familiarity and Novelty</title>
<p>In general, people prefer familiar over novel stimuli, which is the classic mere exposure effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611419266">Zajonc, 1968</xref>). We predicted that a clockwise body movement (turning a crank) by inducing mental progression and an accordingly exploration mind-set (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611419266">Hansen &amp; Topolinski, 2011</xref>) would attenuate or even reverse this preference for familiarity (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611419266">De Vries, Holland, Chenier, Starr, &amp; Winkielman, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Prevalence of Turning Directions</title>
<p>Although Experiment 2 controlled for the affective valence and execution effort of clockwise/counterclockwise movements, it is possible that one of these turning directions is more prevalent or easy than the other, for instance due to ecological or biomechanical factors. This difference between the common and unusual turning direction would allow alternative mechanisms to work, such as mood (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611419266">De Vries et al., 2010</xref>), heuristic versus systematic processing style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611419266">Schwarz, 2002</xref>), or motor fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611419266">Topolinski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611419266">Topolinski &amp; Strack, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611419266">2010</xref>). Thus, a possible preponderance of either clockwise or counterclockwise movements was tested using a daily motor routine. A total of 66 individuals received an empty cup and a spoon and were asked to spontaneously pantomime a person who stirs a coffee, while the used hand and the stirring direction were registered unobtrusively. While there were more participants using their right (54 of 66, 82%) than their left hand (12 of 66, 18%), <italic>t</italic>(65) = 6.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, there was no difference in the numbers of clockwise (35 of 66, 53%) and counterclockwise stirrers (31 of 66, 47%), <italic>p</italic> = .60.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 50 students (35 female and 15 male; 42 right-handers and 8 left-handers) from various disciplines of the University of Leipzig participated for a reward of €2 (approximately US$3 then).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1948550611419266">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>As to-be-moved gadgets, we used cranks, that is, a platform on a desk with two movable round plates with a knob placed on each. As stimuli, we used a pool of 20 Chinese ideographs (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611419266">Zajonc, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611419266">Topolinski &amp; Strack, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1948550611419266">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The study was introduced as an investigation of multitasking involving arm movements and vision judgments such as during car driving. Participants were seated at the desk with the two cranks and were asked to turn the cranks continuously during the whole task using one hand per crank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611419266">Figure 1A</xref>). Between participants, the turning direction (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) was varied (<italic>n</italic> = 25 in each condition). Importantly, to avoid semantic labeling effects of the current movement trajectory (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611419266">Eder &amp; Rothermund, 2008</xref>), this direction was not instructed by semantic labels (such as “to the right,” or “clockwise”) but rather by a schematic depiction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611419266">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>While turning the cranks, participants watched Chinese ideographs on a PC screen in front of them. In a study phase, 10 randomly chosen Chinese ideographs were presented for 1,000 ms each and 2,000 ms interitem interval. After a break of 1 min, these already presented ideographs were shown again (with the same presentation timings) randomly mixed with 10 novel ideographs in random order. Participants were asked to indicate their liking of each appearing stimulus by briefly interrupting their turning exercise and pressing a button on a scale from 1 (<italic>I do not like it at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>I like it a lot</italic>; test phase).</p>

<title>Debriefing</title>
<p>After the task, a PC-directed debriefing probed for participants’ suspicions concerning the purpose of the experiment beyond the multitasking perspective in the cover story. No participant reported a suspicion concerning the turning directions or preference for old and novel stimuli. Also, in the following experiments, no valid suspicions were reported. Thus, we will leave out the report of the debriefing.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>A 2 (Exposure: old items, new items; within) × 2 (Turning Direction: clockwise, counterclockwise; between) analysis of variance (ANOVA) solely yielded an interaction between Exposure and Turning Direction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 48) = 15.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, η<sub>p</sub>

In contrast, however, participants who turned the cranks clockwise liked old stimuli (<italic>M</italic>

<sub>counterclockwise-new</sub> = 4.27, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.85), reversing the mere exposure effect, <italic>t</italic>(24) = 2.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .031, <italic>d</italic> = 0.36. This pattern was not moderated by participants’ handedness (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611419266">Casasanto, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although participants were not aware of the relation between turning direction and the preference for old and novel stimuli, a meaningless body movement could reverse the classic mere exposure effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611419266">Zajonc, 1968</xref>). Note that the two experimental conditions (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) were completely balanced on various motor and valence aspects, such as the amount of arm flexion versus extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611419266">Cacioppo, Priester, &amp; Berntson, 1993</xref>), up–down and right–left motion trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611419266">Casasanto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611419266">Eder &amp; Rothermund, 2008</xref>), and right and left hemisphere involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611419266">Cretenet &amp; Dru, 2004</xref>), rendering the accordingly alternative motivational explanations unlikely (which also applies to the following experiments).</p>

<p>Thus, even self-reported experiential openness, which is conceptualized as a rather stable personality trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611419266">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>), was affected by rotational direction. The body movements in the present task were not circular themselves—but rather linear—and only effected an object rotation (cf., action-effects, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611419266">Topolinski, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Experiment 3: Visual Rotation and Novelty Preference</title>
<p>The inductions of rotational direction so far involved both motor and visual components since participants manipulated objects and also received visual feedback on this performance. As a further generalization, we tested whether merely passive perception of an objection rotation would also influence novelty preference. We used a rotating square (instead, for instance, a dot moving in a circle) as inducer to avoid visual similarities with clocks or loading animations in the Internet.</p>

<sec id="section18-1948550611419266">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section19-1948550611419266">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 81 (51 female and 30 male; 71 right-handers and 10 left-handers) German individuals from different professional backgrounds participated for a reward of €2 (approximately US$4 then).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1948550611419266">
<title>Material and Procedure</title>
<p>As visual rotation induction, a black square was used appearing 7 × 7 cm large on a white background on the PC screen rotating either clockwise or counterclockwise (66.67 r/min). Both the mere exposure paradigm (Experiment 1) and the openness to experience measure (Experiment 2) were replicated (with their sequence counterbalanced across participants) with the following modification. Before each trial (each Chinese ideograph with subsequent preference rating and each item of the openness to experience scale), the rotating square was presented for 3,000 ms, with rotation direction manipulated between participants (clockwise <italic>n</italic> = 41, counterclockwise <italic>n</italic> = 40).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1948550611419266">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The preference ratings in the mere exposure paradigm yielded a significant interaction between Exposure (old vs. new; within) and Square Rotation Direction (clockwise vs. counterclockwise; between), <italic>F</italic>(1, 79) = 9.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .003, η<sub>p</sub>
<sup>2</sup> = .11, and no other effects (<italic>p</italic>s &lt; .12). Participants who were seeing a square rotating counterclockwise liked old (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>counterclockwise-old</sub> = 4.27, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.29) more than novel stimuli (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>counterclockwise-new</sub> = 3.89, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.37), <italic>t</italic>(39) = 4.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.29. However, participants who were seeing the square rotating clockwise did not show a reliable difference between old (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>counterclockwise-old</sub> = 3.71, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.25) and novel stimuli (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>counterclockwise-new</sub> = 3.83, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.41), <italic>t</italic> &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> = .40.</p>
<p>The aggregated openness to experience scale (Cronbach’s α = .85) ranged from −0.50 to 1.75 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.87, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.56). Participants who were seeing the square rotating clockwise scored higher (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>clockwise</sub> = 0.99, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.53) than participants who were seeing the square rotating counterclockwise (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>counterclockwise</sub> = 0.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.56), <italic>t</italic>(79) = 2.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .044, <italic>d</italic> = 0.46.</p>
<p>Thus, the mere perception of a rotating square interspersed between items had a similar impact on novelty preference and openness to experience as turning movements had had in Experiments 1 and 2. However, this perceptual rotation induction yielded a comparably smaller impact than the motor turning induction. It did not reverse but only attenuated the mere exposure effect—clockwise rotation induction did not induce a preference toward novel stimuli but rather an indifference—and showed a smaller effect size in modulating openness to experience.</p>
<p>Concerning the locus of the present causal factors, it is interesting that passive viewing of an object rotating still influenced novelty orientation. However, this apparently purely perceptual induction does not rule out motor components because we cannot watch a rotating stimulus without rotating our eyes ourselves; thus, the present induction also instigated rotational motor/oculomotor activity (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611419266">Topolinski, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>One final objection is that although we used nonverbal rotation instructions, participants may have labeled the present moving directions spontaneously (e.g., clockwise, or to the right), allowing for semantic priming mechanisms beyond mere sensorimotor paths (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611419266">Eder &amp; Rothermund, 2008</xref>). This alternative explanation was ruled out in the final experiment.</p>

<title>Experiment 4: Exploration Behavior</title>
<p>The present phenomenon should be generalized to a turning induction that prevents semantic labeling effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611419266">Eder &amp; Rothermund, 2008</xref>) and to actual exploration behavior, which is a central dimension of novelty seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611419266">Zuckerman, 1984</xref>). Thus, participants were asked to choose jelly beans from a variety of more and less conventional flavors from a “Lazy Susan”—that is, a rotating turntable—that could only be moved in one direction.</p>

<p>A wooden circular turntable 60 cm in diameter (the Lazy Susan) was placed on a conventional desk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611419266">Figure 2</xref>
). A hidden locking mechanism could be switched between participants to allow only clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of this turntable (<italic>n</italic> = 25 in each condition). If being turned into the other direction, the turntable would block. This mechanical constraint rendered any turning instruction unnecessary and prevented a spontaneous semantic labeling of the turning movement. The candy was an assortment of 16 flavors of jelly beans that were easily available for purchase in Germany.</p>

<p>In a pretest, <italic>N</italic> = 10 independent raters indicated on an 11-point Likert-type scale how <italic>conventional</italic> (0) or <italic>unusual</italic> (10) the name of each flavor was. The name of the sort rather than its taste was rated because later participants would also base their choice on the names. Based on these ratings, the relatively conventional flavors were apple, cherry, coconut, lime, lemon, orange, peach, and strawberry; and the relatively unconventional flavors were blueberry, popcorn, chewing gum, chocolate, cotton candy, marshmallow, melon, and punch. One token of each flavor was placed in a small plastic cup on the edge of the circular turntable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611419266">Figure 2</xref>). The name of each sort was depicted on a small sign beneath the cup so that participants had to rotate the turntable to read the names before choosing. The sequence of flavors around the table was in alphabetic order of the German names, thus random with respect to conventional and unconventional sorts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1948550611419266">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>At the end of an experimental session involving various unrelated tasks, participants were led to the turntable and were asked to read each of the depicted names of the candy sorts and to choose 5 of the 16 flavors as a candy reward for their participation, in addition to their monetary compensation. To unobtrusively indicate the rotation direction, the experimenter gently turned the turntable a few degrees when introducing it to the participant. Then, the experimenter left the participant alone going to her working desk on the other side of the laboratory from which she could observe and record the hand (right or left) with which the participant turned the Lazy Susan. After their choice participants were dismissed, their choice could be recorded on the basis of the emptied cups on the Lazy Susan.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1948550611419266">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Those participants who were assigned the clockwise turntable chose a greater number of unconventional flavors (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>clockwise</sub> = 2.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.29) than participants using the counterclockwise turntable (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>counterclockwise</sub> = 1.72, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.34), <italic>t</italic>(48) = 2.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .047, <italic>d</italic> = 0.57. Between the two turning groups, the number of participants using their right, their left, or both hands for turning did not differ reliably (clockwise: 18 right, 2 left, and 5 both; counterclockwise, 16 right, 3 left, and 6 both; <italic>t</italic>s &lt; 1). Inserting handedness as a control variable did not change the effect. Thus, the mere turning direction of the Lazy Susan affected participants’ overt exploration behavior, with clockwise compared to counterclockwise turning increasing the tendency to choose unconventional, or novel, sorts by 44%. It is important to emphasize that the current motor task, namely, to turn the Lazy Susan slightly to read the candy names, did not require any labeling of the movement, rendering semantic priming effects unlikely.</p>

<sec id="section28-1948550611419266">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The present experiments show that the rotational direction of meaningless body movements and even passively perceived rotating objects substantially shape novelty orientation, with clockwise compared to counterclockwise rotation increasing preference and openness to novelty as well as exploration behavior. We argue that these effects were triggered by the abstract sensorimotor symbol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611419266">Barsalou, 1999</xref>) of rotational direction, which activates according to temporal representations (similar to other, static spatial features, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611419266">Boroditsky, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611419266">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611419266">Casasanto &amp; Boroditsky, 2008</xref>), with clockwise rotation implying progression and thus inducing a novelty preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611419266">Bardo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611419266">Roberti, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611419266">Zuckerman, 1984</xref>) and counterclockwise rotation implying regression and thus inducing a familiarity mind-set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611419266">De Vries et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611419266">Hansen &amp; Topolinski, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This abstract representation of rotational direction could be activated by circular movements (turning cranks, Experiment 1), linear movements that effected an object rotation (rotating paper towels, turning a Lazy Susan, Experiments 2 and 4), and merely perceiving a rotating object without any motor task, thus, covering visual, motor, and proprioceptive domains. The finding that the passive perceptual induction (Experiment 3) yielded less pronounced effects than the motor tasks (Experiments 1 and 2) suggests that the sensorimotor representation of rotational direction is additively constituted by different domains because the perceptual induction only involved visual (but see below), while the motor tasks involved both motor and visual information. However, a precise disentangling of the driving modalities (e.g., visual vs. proprioceptive) should be attempted in future research since the apparently purely perceptual induction in Experiment 3 (seeing a rotating square) still involved motor components, namely eye movements that necessarily accompany visual stimulus perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611419266">Topolinski, 2010</xref>). Beyond this, we assume that rotational direction can be induced by other domains as well, such as the vestibular system (e.g., turning a person sitting in a revolving chair).</p>
<p>Especially the involvement of visual and motor components leads to interesting further research questions because both these factors can be pitted against each other, for instance when facing a target person who is turning something, for instance a barrel organ player. In this case, the visual information is reversed to the target’s performed direction, but automatic mimicry processes or perspective taking might induce the original turning direction; an effect that is likely moderated by perspective taking and perceiver–target relationship (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611419266">Hawk, Fischer, &amp; Van Kleef, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As we have argued, we assume that the mapping between rotational and temporal direction is acquired through massive sensorimotor experience in both perceiving perceptual symbols (e.g., clocks) and operating on rotational gadgets (e.g., volume control; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611419266">Zwaan &amp; Taylor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611419266">Zwaan, Taylor, &amp; de Boer, 2010</xref>); a learning experience that is likely found in most individuals because rotational symbols are omnipresent. However, specific motor expertise, for instance, in craftsmen, film editors, or disk jockeys, might even enhance the present effects. On the other hand, a concurrent motor interference (e.g., performing clockwise hand movements while watching counterclockwise object rotations) may disturb them (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611419266">Topolinski &amp; Strack, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611419266">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, it should be mentioned that the current mapping between rotational and temporal direction goes beyond the Spatial Numerical Association of Response Codes (SNARC) effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611419266">Dehaene, 1992</xref>), which is the finding that increasing numbers (i.e., numerical progression) are mentally represented from left to right. This left-to-right increase is only true for the upper semicircle of a clockwise arrangement but is reversed for the lower semicircle. As a consequence, the SNARC effect can be reversed for clockwise number arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611419266">Bächtold, Baumüller, &amp; Brugger, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Future research might also address even further reaching cognitive and motivational consequences in ecological settings, such as the turning direction of revolving doors and passengers’ consumer behavior or wheels of fortunes in risk taking and gambling.</p>
