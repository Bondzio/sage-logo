<p>As every social science historian who studies homicide knows, it can sometimes be as difficult to measure the potential correlates of homicide as it is to measure the level of homicide in a given society. Of course, some kinds of homicide have relatively straightforward economic and demographic correlates that can be measured with great precision. For instance, homicide rates for children followed a clear pattern from the mid-sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries in locations that have been studied to date in North America and Western Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088767912442501">Roth, 2011</xref>). The rates moved up and down in long, smooth curves that are visible only when traced over a hundred years or more. The rates at which children were murdered by parents or guardians followed the inverse of the birth rate. Low murder rates for neonates, infants, and children correlated with:</p>
<list id="list1-1088767912442501" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Higher birth rates</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lower ages of mothers at the births of their first children</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Higher proportions of women who marry at least once</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Higher rates of premarital pregnancy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Longer life expectancy for children</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Higher adult heights (a function of net nutrition)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>How were birth rates, premarital pregnancy, marriage, life expectancy, and height related to murders of children by parents or guardians? The child murder rate and the fertility rate appear to have been driven by the same forces. The child murder rate was a function of the cost of children relative to parental resources and to parental ambitions for themselves and their children. When real wages dropped by more than a third for the poorest 40 percent of the population in England in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, young women and men found it harder to marry and raise families. The birth rate dropped, life expectancy dropped, heights fell, premarital pregnancy rates fell, the age of the mother at first birth rose, fewer women married, and the neonaticide indictment rate jumped five-fold. When real wages rose in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, the trends reversed, and the neonaticide indictment rate fell to its previous level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912442501">Roth, 2001a</xref>).</p>
<p>The rise in child homicides in the mid-nineteenth century was driven more by rising ambitions, however, than economic want, even though most parents who killed their children were poor. Real wages rose among the poor, but ambitions rose faster. Women in particular embraced new educational opportunities, sought economic independence through work outside the home in teaching, needle trades, and factory work, became more active in community affairs and voluntary organizations, and raised their economic expectations for themselves and their children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1088767912442501">1</xref></sup> These rising ambitions made children more costly in terms of time and money, so parents limited their child-rearing duties and financial obligations by beginning childbearing later and ending it sooner through abstinence, contraception, and abortion. And when unrealized ambition led to frustration and stress, parents killed newborns, infants, and older children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767912442501">Roth, 2001b</xref>). Historians have yet to measure ambition or the degree to which the failure to realize a particular ambition led to frustration, but there are enough good proxies for ambition, such as the level of female education and female participation in the work force, to support the evidence of rising ambition that humanistic historians have gathered from letters, diaries, novels, and periodicals.</p>
<p>The correlates of intimate partner homicides are more difficult to measure. The rates of romance homicides jumped suddenly in the northern United States in the 1830s and 1840s, and probably in northwestern Europe as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912442501">Roth, 2009a</xref>, pp. 250-290). The increase in romance homicide rates correlated with a shift in the economic balance of power between men and women, which gave women the ability to delay marriage and to be more selective in the suitors they entertained. But the increase was also correlated with changes in feelings and beliefs associated with marriage and romance. The increase in murders of lovers appears to have been caused by changes in the ideal of romantic love, which led young men and women to invest more of their energies in intimate relationships, especially if they believed they had found their “one and only” true love, and left them at sea when those relationships ended.</p>
<p>Thanks to the content analysis of American periodicals by H. H. Lantz and his associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088767912442501">Lantz, Schmitt, Britton, &amp; Snyder, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767912442501">Lantz, Schmitt, &amp; Herman, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088767912442501">Lantz, Keyes, &amp; Schultz, 1975</xref>), it is possible to measure the changes in ideas about marriage and romance that humanistic historians have identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088767912442501">Rothman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088767912442501">Lystra, 1989</xref>). The changes correlate precisely with the change in the romance murder rate. The rate rose as soon as practical considerations gave way to “happiness” as the sole reason for marrying, and young men embraced the potentially dangerous illusions that love can conquer all—even differences of class and race—and that we are each uniquely destined for one and only one person (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912442501">Table 1</xref>). Most perpetrators of romance homicides and attempted homicides were respected, well-educated, native-born Protestants who were likely to be well versed in romantic literature, with its emphasis on passion, self-expression, and the idea that true lovers were destined for each other. An alarming proportion of the assaults occurred when young men tried to reach above their “station” and win the love of a woman of a different class or race, or refused to let go when a relationship failed or did not progress beyond friendship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912442501">Roth, 2009a</xref>, pp. 279-290).</p>

<p>It is more difficult, however, to obtain accurate measures of the potential correlates of homicides among unrelated adults. As Gary LaFree, Manuel Eisner, Roger Gould, and I discovered independently in the 1990s, homicide rates among unrelated adults—nearly all of which have been committed historically by males—appear to be determined by feelings toward government and society, rather than by more easily measured phenomena like the performance of the economy or the number of police on the street (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088767912442501">LaFree, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767912442501">Eisner, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088767912442501">Gould, 2003</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912442501">Roth, 2009a</xref>). As I put it in my own work, there have been four correlates of low rates in North America and Western Europe over the past 450 years:</p>
<list id="list2-1088767912442501" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The belief that government is stable and that its legal and judicial institutions are unbiased and will redress wrongs and protect lives and property</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A feeling of trust in government and the officials who run it, and a belief in their legitimacy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patriotism, empathy, and fellow feeling arising from racial, religious, or political solidarity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The belief that the social hierarchy is legitimate, that one’s position in society is or can be satisfactory and that one can command the respect of others without resorting to violence</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>When these correlates are in place, the homicide rate among unrelated adults can fall below 1 per 100,000 per year. When they are not, the homicide rate can soar to tens or hundreds per 100,000.</p>
<p>But these correlates are hard to measure. Humanistic histories of political instability, government legitimacy, and nationalism, racism, and class relations offer great insight into these feelings and beliefs. In fact, I believe they can tell us more about such feelings and beliefs than any opinion poll or panel study ever could, because they are based on a wide variety of sources and an intimate understanding of a particular time and place. But we cannot place the historical study of homicide on a scientific basis unless we find ways to quantify the shifts in feelings and beliefs that humanistic historians have identified. Then those shifts can be correlated more precisely with changes in homicide rates, and we can defend humanistic historical scholarship against skeptics who believe it is too impressionistic or subjective to offer reliable, reproducible insights into the past.</p>
<p>How, for instance, can we measure feelings toward government and society in the United States? For the colonial and revolutionary period, a number of quantifiable indicators of political instability, government legitimacy, and fellow feeling are available that can serve as potential correlates of the homicide rate among unrelated European American adults. First, thanks to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912442501">Hearn (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912442501">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088767912442501">2005</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912442501">Teeters (1963)</xref>, near-complete lists of legal executions are available for New England, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, and those can be supplemented with less-complete lists for other jurisdictions compiled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088767912442501">Espy and Smykla (2004)</xref>. These lists identify persons who were executed for treason or sedition—a measure of political instability and of challenges to the legitimacy of government. They also identify persons who were executed for heresy, witchcraft, or moral offenses (adultery, bestiality, pederasty, etc.)—a measure of hostility, division, and distrust within communities.</p>
<p>Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088767912442501">Gilje (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088767912442501">2011</xref>) has created a database of over 4,000 riots and rebellions in the United States from colonial times to the present, which can be supplemented with accounts on riots and rebellions available in other historical works, such as the colonial and state histories commissioned for the bicentennial by Scribners and KTO Press. Of course, as Gilje observes, not all riots are symptomatic of deep divisions within communities or polities, but those that led to fatalities (mob violence, vigilantism, retaliation by authorities, etc.) usually were. If we divide deadly riots and rebellions, as Gilje does, into those that were political (involving contests for power or protests against the abuse of power by the government or its officials) and those that sought to regulate the behavior of members of the community (involving the persecution of persons suspected of witchcraft, heresy, or moral offenses), we can develop a second measure of political stability, government legitimacy, and fellow feeling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1088767912442501">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>We can also supplement the time series on executions and on deadly riots and rebellions with a third series that enumerates conflicts that led to the banishment or forced exile of persons who were on the losing end of community or political conflicts, such as the expulsion of Antinomians from Puritan Massachusetts or of Tories during the American Revolution.</p>
<p>What happens when we track these three indicators of political stability, government legitimacy, and fellow feeling through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries? Legal executions, deadly riots and rebellions, and banishments and forced exiles caused by political or community conflicts followed the same pattern, whether the counts are incident-based or victim-based (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1088767912442501">Figures 1</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1088767912442501">4</xref>). The counts were high through the Glorious Revolution, negligible from the end of the Glorious Revolution through the French and Indian War, and high during the American Revolution, tapering up during the Imperial crisis, 1765-1774, exploding during the Revolution itself, and tapering down in the 1790s. That is precisely the pattern followed by the homicide rate among unrelated European American adults in the places that have been studied to date: New England, Pennsylvania, and the Chesapeake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912442501">Roth, 2009a</xref>, pp. 27-107, 145-179). Only five incidents occurred between 1693 and 1765, and two of those (a homicide and a forced exile) were related to Cary’s Rebellion in North Carolina, 1710-1711. The others involved an execution for bestiality in Penn’s Neck, New Jersey, an execution for treason in South Carolina during the French and Indian War, and a homicide by militiamen in New York City who were trying to bar British soldiers from rescuing a comrade who was jailed for debt. Only one deadly incident occurred after 1788: the Whiskey Rebellion. Otherwise, these executions, homicides, and banishments coincided with periods of high homicide rates among unrelated European American adults. It appears that political stability, government legitimacy, and fellow feeling did indeed hold the key to low homicide rates in colonial and revolutionary America.</p>

<p>These correlations are not mere artifacts of the number of deadly acts of collective violence that occurred during periods of political instability or communal strife. It is important to distinguish among various types of homicide and to calculate rates separately for each kind of homicide, to determine whether particular rates go up and down together and are likely to have the same causes. But these correlations hold whether we include or exclude from the homicide rate those homicides that occurred during riots or rebellions. In every jurisdiction studied to date, the number of deadly acts of collective violence that stemmed from political or communal conflict was negligible compared to the number of everyday homicides between individuals, except in Maryland in the seventeenth century, and even there the rate of everyday homicides correlated with measures of political instability and community strife.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1088767912442501">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nor are these correlations mere artifacts of the general rate of executions. For instance, executions for military offenses (mutiny, treason, dereliction of duty) and homicides caused by resistance to press gangs or by fights between gangs of sailors from rival nations followed a different pattern. They occurred with frequency during wartime, even if the homicide rate among unrelated adults was low (as it was during the latter years of King William’s War, 1689-1697, or during the War of the Spanish Succession, 1701-1714, King George’s War, 1740-1748, and the French and Indian War, 1754-1763). And they were rare during times of peace, even if the homicide rate was high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1088767912442501">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, there was one type of deadly collective violence identified by Gilje that did not follow the homicide rate among unrelated adults: homicides that stemmed from land disputes between colonies. But these disputes—such as the border war between Maryland and Pennsylvania in the 1730s and between Massachusetts and New York in the 1750s and early 1760s—were localized. They involved only persons who claimed or lived on land in the disputed areas, so they did not always coincide with or contribute to broader protests or rebellions against authority. These disputes always had the potential to turn deadly, however, which is why they claimed lives even during the periods of political stability and low homicide rates among unrelated adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1088767912442501">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>It is also possible to study feelings and beliefs about government and society more directly. For example, thanks to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1088767912442501">Zelinsky (1988</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088767912442501">Merritt (1966</xref>), excellent measures are available of the degree to which citizens identified with the British Empire or the American nation and with national heroes—proxies for patriotic feeling and government legitimacy. Zelinsky traced the naming patterns of new counties from colonial times to 1920, including the proportion of new counties named for British notables or American notables; and Merritt traced the incidence of explicit or royal British symbols in American newspapers during the imperial crisis, 1735-1775. When the number of counties named for British heroes soared after the Glorious Revolution (a sign of patriotic solidarity), the homicide rate among unrelated European Americans fell. And when the number of counties named for British heroes fell during the imperial crisis (a sign of a decline in patriotic solidarity), the homicide rate rose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1088767912442501">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1088767912442501">7</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1088767912442501">4</xref></sup> The homicide rate also correlated with a decline in references to explicit British symbols such as the lion. At this time the number of counties named for American heroes had yet to rise to a high level (a sign that a new kind of patriotic solidarity had yet to form),</p>

Ngrams in its first iteration has limitations: the selection of books is far from complete before 1800, and it is impossible as yet to pull out strings of words that could reveal the context in which particular words were used. Ngrams cannot yet distinguish between a word used 100 times in a single book and a word used once in 100 books, nor can it account for the impact of new genres (novels, technical manuals, etc.) on the incidence of words that remain common in older genres. Ngrams is nonetheless a valuable new tool for tracing the incidence of words or phrases that constitute “hate speech” or “identity speech” in a particular time or place—yet another marker of division or unity within polities or communities.</p>
<p>The sudden decline in the homicide rate among unrelated European Americans at the end of the seventeenth century coincided with what humanistic historians have identified as a sudden upsurge in racial solidarity among whites, caused by the rise of racial slavery and the disastrous Indian wars of the 1670s, 1680s, and 1690s, and a lessening of hostility among whites along religious or class lines, caused by the decline in sectarian strife and a change in attitude toward the laboring poor, who were treated with contempt in the early and mid-seventeenth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1088767912442501">5</xref></sup> Ngrams shows that these shifts in feeling occurred precisely when humanistic historians said they did: in the 1670s and 1680s, when the homicide rate began to fall. Words like “heretic” and “zealot” and casual references to poor men and women as “rogue” or “whore” nearly disappeared from the lexicon as whites drew together across religious and class lines. Words like “slave” and “negro,” which bespoke a new kind of racial consciousness and solidarity, came to the fore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1088767912442501">Figures 8</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1088767912442501">10</xref>). At the same time, colonists stopped naming new counties with aboriginal terms, yet another sign of intensifying racial feeling. Prior to the disastrous conflicts with Native Americans in New England and the Chesapeake in 1675-1676, twelve percent of all new counties were named with aboriginal terms. But in the seventy-five years following King Philip’s War and Bacon’s Rebellion, only one new county—Nantucket—bore an aboriginal name, and that island had been named before those conflicts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1088767912442501">6</xref></sup> Once again, it appears that fellow feeling was essential for a low homicide rate within a particular group.</p>

<p>Similar indicators can be used to measure the degree of political stability and fellow feeling in the nineteenth century. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088767912442501">Turchin (2010</xref>) has developed an incident-based indicator of political stability and instability based on extra-legal killings by vigilantes and on homicides during riots or rebellions (drawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088767912442501">Gilje, 2011</xref> and from reports of riots in several electronically searchable newspapers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1088767912442501">Figure 11</xref>). Turchin’s indicator remains low through the early 1840s, except for a brief increase in the mid-1830s. But it turns suddenly upward during the Mexican War, spikes to its highest level during the Civil War, recedes slowly as Reconstruction came to a close, and rises again in the 1890s. That is precisely the course taken by the homicide rate among unrelated adults in the United States as a whole, which in the early nineteenth century had an extraordinarily low homicide rate in the North and the mountain South, and only a moderate homicide rate in the slave South (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912442501">Roth, 2009a</xref>, pp. 180-249, 297-434). The Turchin index of political stability supports the hypothesis that political polarization and instability caused the homicide rate to soar in the mid-nineteenth century and remain high through 1900.</p>

<p>The incidence of politically or racially charged words follows the same pattern in the 19th century. For example, consider the word “nigger,” which in daily use represented contempt and hostility both for African Americans and for whites who opposed the extension of slavery to the territories or favored the abolition of slavery and racial equality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1088767912442501">Figure 12</xref>). Or consider the phrase “slave power,” which represented hostility toward slave owners and toward politicians and political organizations that sought to secure or strengthen the institution of slavery within the Union (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1088767912442501">Figure 13</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1088767912442501">7</xref></sup> The spike in the use of these terms occurred during the Mexican War, which is precisely the point at which the homicide rate among unrelated adults jumped. This pattern also appears in the naming of new counties. The proportion of counties named for American heroes—a measure of faith in the nation and of a feeling of kinship with fellow Americans—peaked in the early nineteenth century, when the homicide rate in the United States was low. But the proportion fell sharply beginning in the 1840s, as the nation disintegrated, national feeling declined, and the homicide rate surged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1088767912442501">Figure 14</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1088767912442501">8</xref></sup></p>

<p>Quantitative measures are also available to test rival theories of homicide. Proponents of Norbert Elias’s “civilization thesis” argue, among other things, that the improvement of manners after the Middle Ages led to a higher degree of self-control and restraint, which in turn caused a gradual decline in the homicide rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088767912442501">Mennell 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088767912442501">Spierenburg 2008</xref>). Elias, in Mennell’s words, “linked changes in people’s everyday behavior, in the codes of manners they followed and in their typical feelings and emotions, to the formation of states with relatively effective monopolies of violence.” Over time, “social pressure towards self-constraint” tilted the balance “in favour of more demanding social standards of habitual self-control” and encouraged people to feel shame, embarrassment, disgust, or repugnance when those standards were violated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088767912442501">Mennell, 2007</xref>, pp. 1, 6-11). However, the diffusion of refined manners and the rhetoric of self-mastery and restraint, which Elias considered both causes and consequences of the civilizing process, had little impact on the level of violence in the United States. These cultural changes took hold in colonial America in the early and mid-eighteenth century, after the homicide rate had already fallen, and they failed to restrain interpersonal violence when the political order lost legitimacy and destabilized in the late 1760s and early 1770s. In the eighteenth century, words like “polite,” “manners,” and “refinement” assumed a more prominent place in British and American print, according to Google Ngrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1088767912442501">Figures 15</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1088767912442501">17</xref>). Colonists turned increasingly to civil courts to resolve disputes over slander, trespass, assault (which included threats and verbal abuse), and assault and battery (which included physical violence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912442501">Roth, 2009a</xref>, pp. 88-90). The movement toward restraint and refinement was evident as well in quantifiable changes in daily habits and material culture. Between the 1720s and the 1760s, colonists of all classes gradually stopped throwing their garbage into their yards and began to bury it neatly in deep garbage pits. They began to purchase chamber pots for the disposal of human waste. They moved away from the practice of eating with spoons out of communal trenchers and drinking out of communal cups, and embraced the modern practice of eating with forks and using individualized plates and cups. They ate fewer stews and potages, and more tripartite meals with discrete portions of meat, starch, and vegetables. Archaeologist James Deetz associates these changes with a movement toward “order, control, and balance”—away from the “medieval” emphasis on community and toward a modern emphasis on the individual, which he associates with the adoption of the cultural style of the Georgian-era British elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088767912442501">Deetz, 1996</xref>, pp. 63, 86, 185).</p>

<p>Elias’s theory associates these changes with a decrease in interpersonal violence, caused by the increase in self-monitoring and restraint. But as noted, these changes followed the sudden decrease in violence in the late 17th century, and they were powerless to prevent an increase in violence during the revolutionary period. Improvements in manners may have been a consequence of successful nation-building and a decline in interpersonal violence, rather than a cause. It may be that manners improved most rapidly during periods of political stability, government legitimacy, patriotic feeling, and low homicide rates, when members of the middle class and working class, because they felt an attachment to the nation’s elites, were more willing to adopt the elites’ “civilized” behaviors, purchase inexpensive copies of the elites’ “civilized” possessions, and turn to legal institutions run by the elites to redress their personal grievances.</p>
<p>Humanistic histories will remain, I believe, our best gauges of feelings and belief in the past. Social science history can progress only if it is committed to the humanities as well as the sciences. But quantitative measures of feelings and beliefs are important as well, not only because they can verify the findings of humanistic historians, but because they allow us to test theories of behavior more rigorously, whenever those theories suggest that changes in feeling or belief can change behavior, including the propensity to violence.</p>
