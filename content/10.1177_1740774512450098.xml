<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Clinical trials should employ an ITT analysis strategy, comprising a design that attempts to follow up all randomised individuals, a main analysis that is valid under a stated plausible assumption about the missing data, and sensitivity analyses that include all randomised individuals in order to explore the impact of departures from the assumption underlying the main analysis. Following this strategy recognises the extra uncertainty arising from missing outcomes and increases the incentive for researchers to minimise the extent of missing data.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis is essential in avoiding bias in the analysis of randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512450098">1</xref>]. The ITT principle states that all individuals randomised in a clinical trial should be included in the analysis, in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of any departures from the randomised treatment. By following this principle, data analysts preserve the benefit of randomisation in creating treatment groups that do not differ systematically on any factors except those assigned in the trial, whereas not following the ITT principle risks introducing selection bias.</p>
<p>One implication of the ITT principle is that investigators should aim to collect outcome data on all randomised individuals. It is essential to maximise the extent of outcome data collection by careful trial design, including appropriate eligibility criteria, attention to the burden of data collection on participants, and energetic measures to remain in contact with participants and regain contact with lost participants. Further information is given by Refs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512450098">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512450098"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512450098">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite investigators’ best efforts, missing outcome data are common. From a statistical perspective, any analysis of a clinical trial with incomplete outcome data makes untestable assumptions. For example, it is often assumed that the data are missing at random (MAR), which means that missing data are equal in distribution to observed data, conditional on other variables included in the analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512450098">5</xref>]. Some analyses may make the stronger assumption that the data are missing completely at random (MCAR), which means that missing data are unconditionally equal in distribution to observed data. It is essential that the assumptions made are transparent and plausible, based on knowledge of the trial and the subject-matter area.</p>
<p>A recent report by the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) for the US National Academy of Sciences clarifies many of the design and analysis issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512450098">4</xref>]. In particular, it stresses the importance of careful pre-specification of the causal estimands of primary interest (recommendation 1), choosing designs that minimise treatment withdrawal (recommendation 2), pre-specification of statistical methods and their assumptions in a way that can be understood by clinicians (recommendation 9), and collecting ancillary data that are associated with reasons for missing values, and/or intensively following up a sample of non-respondents (recommendation 15). It describes analysis methods for trials with incomplete data, focussing on methods that assume MAR (chapter 4). It then argues forcefully for analyses that explore the sensitivity of the results to departure from MAR (recommendation 16) and extensively describes how such sensitivity analyses could be performed (chapter 5), although methodology for sensitivity analysis is noted as requiring more statistical research (recommendation 20).</p>
<p>However, there is confusion about how the ITT principle should be applied in the presence of missing outcome data. A strict view would hold that no analysis with missing outcome data can be described as ITT, but such an unattainable standard is unhelpful. The explanatory article to the 2001 revision of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement suggested acceptance of an analysis of observed data: ‘Although those participants [who drop out] cannot be included in the analysis, it is customary still to refer to analysis of all available participants as an intention-to-treat analysis’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774512450098">6</xref>]. On the other hand, Hollis and Campbell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512450098">7</xref>] argued that ‘Complete case analysis, which was the approach used in most trials, violates the principle of intention to treat’. Often, ITT is taken to require imputation: the European Medicines Agency wrote ‘The statistical analysis of a clinical trial generally requires the imputation of values to those data that have not been recorded . . .’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512450098">8</xref>], and Altman wrote ‘No analysis option is ideal here; there is, in effect, a choice between omitting participants without final outcome data or estimating (imputing) the missing outcome data’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512450098">9</xref>]. In new advice, the European Medicines Agency takes a more relaxed view: ‘Full set analysis generally requires the imputation of values or modelling for the unrecorded data’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774512450098">10</xref>], and the 2010 CONSORT checklist no longer includes the ‘widely misused’ phrase ‘intention to treat analysis’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774512450098">11</xref>] and, instead, separately asks whether the analysis was by original assigned groups and what numbers were included in the analyses.</p>
<p>To resolve this confusion, we recently proposed a four-point <italic>ITT analysis strategy</italic> for trials with incomplete outcome data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512450098">12</xref>]:</p>
<list id="list1-1740774512450098" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1) Attempt to follow up all randomised individuals, even if they withdraw from allocated treatment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2) Perform a main analysis that is valid under a plausible assumption about the missing data and that uses all observed data.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3) Perform sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of departures from the assumption made in the main analysis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>4) Account for all randomised individuals, at least in the sensitivity analyses.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The aim of this article is to detail the rationale underpinning this strategy and to illustrate its application. We assume that interest lies in testing and estimating the effect of treatment assignment on clinical outcomes over all randomised individuals: this is the ‘ITT estimand’ or the ‘ITT treatment effect’ and is usually the most clinically-relevant and policy-relevant estimand in large-scale randomised trials. We do not consider other possible estimands discussed in the CNSTAT report, relating to subsets that adhere to treatment; estimating the causal effect of treatment itself, although this may be a useful ancillary analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774512450098">13</xref>]; or estimating the effect of treatment assignment on a composite outcome that includes missingness as one component (common in HIV trials aimed at comparing HIV RNA levels for antiretroviral drugs, where missing values are taken as failures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512450098">14</xref>], but difficult to interpret clinically).</p>
<p>Throughout the article, we consider an outcome either measured at just one time point or measured repeatedly where interest lies mainly in the treatment effect at the last time. Our arguments would apply equally when interest lies in an average outcome such as the area under the curve. We mainly discuss quantitative outcomes and consider other outcome types in the discussion. Our focus is on missing values in the outcome, although in our example, we also deal with missing values of baseline variables.</p>
<p>The article is organised as follows. In section ‘Methods and assumptions’, we describe various commonly used methods of analysis and their underlying assumptions. Section ‘ITT analysis strategy’ details the rationale underpinning the four points of the ITT analysis strategy. Section ‘Harmful consequences of requiring inclusion of all randomised individuals in the main analysis’ shows why the ITT analysis strategy does not require all randomised individuals to be included in the main analysis. Section ‘Case study: the UK700 trial’ uses the UK700 trial in mental health to exemplify the ITT analysis strategy and then to illustrate our argument. We conclude with a discussion in section ‘Discussion’.</p>

<sec id="section8-1740774512450098" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods and assumptions</title>
<p>In this section, we discuss various methods of analysis, noting whether they include all randomised individuals and elucidating their underlying assumptions.</p>
<sec id="section9-1740774512450098">
<title>Last observation carried forward</title>
<p>Last observation carried forward (LOCF) replaces missing final outcomes by the last observed outcome (which could be the baseline value of the outcome). While it is widely used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512450098">15</xref>], and is attractive because it usually allows all individuals to be included in the analysis, it has been widely criticised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774512450098">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774512450098"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774512450098"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774512450098"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774512450098"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774512450098">21</xref>].</p>
<p>The assumption underlying LOCF is often misstated. When the analysis is an unadjusted comparison of means or proportions, LOCF is unbiased if, in each randomised group, the mean of the unobserved values of the final outcome equals (in expectation) the mean of the last observed outcomes in the individuals who drop out. We call this the LOCF assumption. When the analysis is covariate-adjusted, the LOCF assumption is conditional on covariates. LOCF does not require the data to be MCAR, although some authors claim that it does [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774512450098">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774512450098">18</xref>]: MCAR would instead require the missing data to be equal to the observed data in expectation at the final time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512450098">5</xref>].</p>
<p>If the LOCF assumption is false, bias in the LOCF analyses can arise in various ways. If there is a treatment effect at intermediate times but not at the final time, then carrying forward intermediate values can artefactually create a treatment effect at the final time. If unobserved outcomes improve over time, then LOCF tends to favour treatment groups with less dropouts, while if unobserved outcomes deteriorate over time, then LOCF tends to favour treatment groups with more dropouts.</p>
<p>LOCF validly estimates weighted averages of subgroup-specific means at different time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774512450098">22</xref>], but the weights may differ between randomised groups, so this parameter lacks clinical interest and causal interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774512450098">19</xref>]. LOCF is also sometimes defended as being conservative: for conditions that tend to improve over time, it is indeed likely to be conservative for arm-specific mean outcomes, but its bias for the estimated treatment effect is not necessarily in a conservative direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774512450098">20</xref>]. An appropriate justification of LOCF should argue that the average <italic>unobserved</italic> outcomes within each randomised group do not change over time; we have never seen such a justification. Instead, analysts more commonly attempt to justify LOCF by the stability over time of <italic>observed</italic> outcomes, which is not a sufficient argument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774512450098">21</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1740774512450098">
<title>Missing = failure</title>
<p>In some clinical areas, it is common to assume that missing values represent failures. This is only possible when the outcome is categorical (usually binary): for example, in smoking cessation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1740774512450098">23</xref>]. ‘Missing = failure’ is the same as LOCF when the outcome is a measure of improvement observed at just one time point.</p>
<p>Like LOCF, ‘missing = failure’ makes it easy to include all randomised individuals in the analysis. However, the underlying assumption needs to be carefully justified. In particular, ‘missing = failure’ logically implies that every success is actually observed, often a rather implausible assumption. If the assumption is false then ‘missing = failure’, like LOCF, gives conservative estimates of outcomes within randomised groups but not necessarily a conservative estimate of the difference between groups, especially if the amounts of missing data, or their reasons, differ between randomised groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1740774512450098">
<title>Complete-case analysis</title>
<p>In a trial with outcome measured at one time point, a complete-case analysis typically involves a simple outcome comparison between groups or an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in which the outcome is regressed on randomised group, adjusted for baseline variables. These analyses are valid under the assumption that response is MAR given randomised group or given randomised group and baseline, respectively, and can be viewed as likelihood-based.</p>
<p>In a trial with outcomes measured repeatedly, a complete-case analysis would typically exclude any individual whose outcome was not observed at the final follow-up time. Excluding individuals whose outcome is observed at intermediate follow-up times is clearly inappropriate. However, in a survey of 35 such trials, 17 used a complete-case analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512450098">15</xref>]. Likelihood-based analysis of all observed data is preferable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1740774512450098">
<title>Likelihood-based methods</title>
<p>A likelihood-based analysis fits a suitable statistical model to all the observed data. Often this would be a linear mixed model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1740774512450098">24</xref>]. Likelihood-based analyses (including Bayesian analyses) implicitly assume that the data are MAR, unless the missing data mechanism is explicitly modelled. In the case of a trial with outcome measured repeatedly, this means that missing data are equal in distribution to observed data, conditional on the baseline and follow-up variables included in the analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512450098">5</xref>]. With non-monotone missing data patterns, the MAR assumption can be hard to interpret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1740774512450098">25</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1740774512450098">
<title>Multiple imputation</title>
<p>Multiple imputation (MI) is a broadly applicable technique for handling missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1740774512450098">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1740774512450098">27</xref>]. MI is usually able to include all randomised individuals in the analysis. Briefly, missing data are imputed more than once, in a way that reflects the uncertainty about the missing values. In Rubin’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1740774512450098">26</xref>] formulation, each imputed data set is analysed by standard methods, and the point estimates and standard errors (SEs) are combined to provide inferences that reflect the uncertainty about the missing values. Standard implementations of MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774512450098">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774512450098"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774512450098"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1740774512450098"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1740774512450098">32</xref>] assume MAR, although in principle MI may be performed under other missing data mechanisms. Other formulations of MI may provide more accurate SEs in some less-standard settings but are not available in standard software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1740774512450098">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Many MI analyses can be viewed as computationally convenient approximations to likelihood-based analyses based on the observed data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1740774512450098">34</xref>]. For example, if the variables used in imputing the missing data correspond to the variables in the analysis model and a (multivariate) normality assumption is made in both analyses, then an MI analysis approximates a likelihood-based analysis. The quality of the approximation is determined by the Monte Carlo error inherent in MI analysis, which decreases as the number of imputations increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1740774512450098">35</xref>].</p>
<p>In some cases, an MI procedure can be improved by including in the imputation model ‘auxiliary variables’ that are not in the analysis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774512450098">36</xref>, chapter 4]: auxiliary variables in a randomised trial might be secondary outcomes or compliance summaries. MI then produces estimates of the treatment effect that are genuinely different from a likelihood-based analysis, by incorporating information on individuals with missing outcome but observed values of auxiliary variables. However, in our experience, the contribution to such an analysis of individuals missing the outcome of interest is moderate unless correlations between the outcome and one or more auxiliary variables are substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1740774512450098">37</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1740774512450098">
<title>Illustration</title>
<p>Three different assumptions are explored in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774512450098">Figure 1</xref>, which depicts mean outcomes in one arm of a randomised trial. Higher outcomes are assumed to be worse. Individuals with complete data (the solid line) start with mean outcome 10 and improve by a mean of 2 units at time 1, with this improvement sustained at time 2. Individuals who drop out after time 1 started with a better mean outcome and also had a mean improvement of 2 units at time 1. An LOCF analysis (depicted in the left-hand panel) assumes that this mean improvement was sustained up to time 2. An analysis based on MCAR (such as a complete-case analysis) assumes that individuals who drop out after time 1 are similar to completers at time 2, which in this example corresponds to their improvement being transient (middle panel). An analysis based on MAR (such as a likelihood-based analysis) assumes that the missing outcomes at time 2 can be predicted using the relationship in completers between outcomes at the three times. Suppose that this relationship is <italic>E</italic>[<italic>Y2|Y</italic><sub>0</sub>,<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub>] = <italic>α</italic> + <italic>βY</italic><sub>1</sub> with <italic>β =</italic> 0.5, where (<italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub>,<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub>,<italic>Y</italic><sub>2</sub>) are the three outcomes. The observed mean difference between completers and dropouts at time 1 is 2 units, so the MAR assumption implies a mean difference of 2β = 1 unit at time 2 (right-hand panel).</p>

<title>ITT analysis strategy</title>
<p>Having discussed common analyses and their assumptions, we now discuss the rationale for the four-point ITT analysis strategy.</p>
<sec id="section16-1740774512450098">
<title>1. Attempt to follow up all randomised individuals, even if they withdraw from allocated treatment</title>
<p>This point refers to the design of trials in which patients may withdraw from their allocated treatment during the trial. Some trials do not attempt to follow up patients after treatment withdrawal. This has four serious disadvantages. First, it is contrary to the spirit of the ITT principle. Second, it means that all observed data are ‘on-treatment’, and so standard analyses based on observed data attempt to estimate an ‘on-treatment’ effect and not the ITT treatment effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774512450098">36</xref>]. (If the ‘on-treatment’ effect is really of interest, then a different approach to the design and analysis may be appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512450098">4</xref>].) Third, it often makes MAR less plausible because individuals who stop trial treatment are often more highly selected than those who are simply lost to follow-up. Fourth, even if it introduces no bias, it can reduce the power of the trial if treatment effects are long lasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774512450098">38</xref>].</p>
<p>We therefore believe that no primary analysis of such a trial should be described as ITT. Instead, trials should attempt to follow up all randomised individuals, including those who withdraw from treatment (an ‘ITT design’) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1740774512450098">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1740774512450098">40</xref>]. The individuals who have withdrawn from trial treatment tend to be harder to follow up, but if at least some data are collected, then analysis based on MAR can allow for treatment withdrawals and can attempt to estimate the ITT treatment effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774512450098">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1740774512450098">41</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1740774512450098">
<title>2. Perform a main analysis that is valid under a plausible assumption about the missing data and that uses all observed data</title>
<p>This point emphasises the importance of assumptions. Any trial report should state the assumption made about the missing data in the main analysis – for example, MAR or the LOCF assumption – and give reasons why the assumption is plausible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1740774512450098">42</xref>].</p>
<p>We require the inclusion of all observed outcome data. Analyses that exclude some observed outcome data would not be acceptable without strong rationale such as doubt over the integrity of the data. In particular, complete-case analysis of repeated measures data (section ‘Complete-case analysis’) would not be consistent with the ITT analysis strategy.</p>
<p>The controversial point here is that we do not require the inclusion of all randomised individuals in the main analysis – that is, we do not require inclusion of individuals with no outcome measures – because the validity of an analysis is determined by whether its assumptions are correct: a valid estimate of the ITT estimand is consistent with the ITT principle. Thus, analyses of all observed data (such as mixed models) should be acceptable if the MAR assumption is reasonably plausible in the clinical context. Harmful consequences of requiring the inclusion of all randomised individuals in the main analysis are given in section ‘Harmful consequences of requiring inclusion of all randomised individuals in the main analysis’. Of course, analyses that <italic>do</italic> include all randomised individuals are acceptable if they make a plausible assumption: for example, in a smoking cessation trial, it might be plausible to assume that all individuals with missing outcomes are still smoking.</p>

<title>3. Perform sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of departures from the assumption made in the main analysis</title>
<p>All analyses with missing data make untestable assumptions, so it is always important to perform sensitivity analyses exploring the impact of departures from the assumptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1740774512450098">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1740774512450098">44</xref>]. Appropriate sensitivity analyses should address departures from the assumptions that are relevant for the estimand at hand in an accessible way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many sensitivity analyses used in practice are inappropriate. For example, in one survey, the most common form of sensitivity analysis was LOCF when the primary analysis adopted a complete-case analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512450098">15</xref>]. Agreement between the results of the LOCF and complete-case analyses is not necessarily reassuring because the assumptions underlying the two methods could both be wrong, and so both results could be biased. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774512450098">Figure 2</xref> illustrates this problem. Although LOCF and MCAR impute the missing values at time 2 in different ways, they both impute the same mean value, 7. It would be wrong to derive reassurance from this agreement. In fact, an MAR analysis would impute a different value, 6.</p>

<p>Instead, a ‘principled’ sensitivity analysis should move smoothly away from the assumptions underpinning the primary analysis, in a way that is clinically plausible and accessible to those interpreting and using the study results. Kenward <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1740774512450098">45</xref>] describe the procedure as follows: ‘It is necessary to properly parameterise the set of models considered by means of one or more continuous parameters and then to consider all or at least a range of models along such a continuum’. For example, one might define a parameter δ equal to the difference between the mean of the observed data and the mean of the unobserved data, adjusted for other observed variables. Under an MAR analysis, δ is assumed to be zero. A sensitivity analysis would consider plausible alternative values of δ. It is important to consider the possibility that δ differs across randomised groups: for example, missing data after a psychological intervention may be further from MAR than after no intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1740774512450098">46</xref>]. This idea underlies computational [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1740774512450098">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1740774512450098"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1740774512450098">49</xref>] and graphical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1740774512450098">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1740774512450098">51</xref>] approaches to sensitivity analysis.</p>
<p>We have focussed here on sensitivity analyses to the untestable assumptions about the missing data; it is also important to verify testable assumptions, such as a normality assumption for outcome data, or the way baseline covariates are entered in the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512450098">4</xref>], although estimated treatment effects are usually far more robust to departures from testable than untestable assumptions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1740774512450098">
<title>4. Account for all randomised individuals, at least in the sensitivity analyses</title>
<p>A key feature of a principled sensitivity analysis as described above is that all individuals must be included in the analysis. For example, if δ ≠ 0 so that missing values differ from observed values, then a complete-case analysis is no longer acceptable. Thus, although an analysis based on MAR need not include all randomised individuals, analyses assuming departures from MAR must include them.</p>
<p>This point provides a key link with previous conceptions of ITT analysis: inclusion of all randomised individuals is important, but the place of that inclusion is in the sensitivity analysis.</p>

<title>Harmful consequences of requiring inclusion of all randomised individuals in the main analysis</title>
<sec id="section21-1740774512450098">
<title>Implausible assumptions</title>
<p>We compare the LOCF and likelihood-based analyses (noting that complete-case analysis of a trial with outcome measured at one time point is effectively a likelihood-based method). The different assumptions underlying these methods were described above. The methods also differ in which randomised individuals are included: if the baseline observation is complete, then LOCF includes all individuals in the analysis, but likelihood-based methods exclude individuals who provide no post-baseline outcome data.</p>
<p>The MAR assumption is often seen as a natural starting point for analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774512450098">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1740774512450098">52</xref>]. A stronger belief in MAR than other assumptions led Molenberghs <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774512450098">17</xref>] to write that ‘A likelihood based ignorable analysis should be seen as a proper way to accommodate information on a patient with postrandomization outcomes, even when such a patient’s profile is incomplete’ and ‘This fact, in conjunction with the use of treatment allocation as randomized rather than as received, shows that [a mixed model analysis] is fully consistent with ITT’. These authors do not explain what they mean by ITT but seem to be arguing that if an analysis is suitable, it must conform to ITT.</p>
<p>We avoid blanket statements about the plausibility of particular assumptions: this must instead be determined in each trial using subject-matter knowledge. However, in some trials, MAR is more plausible than the LOCF assumption. In such trials, an MAR-based analysis excluding individuals who provide no post-baseline outcome data would be preferable to an LOCF analysis including them. Thus, requiring inclusion of all randomised individuals in the main analysis would invite analysts to adopt a less plausible assumption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1740774512450098">
<title>Unnecessary complexity</title>
<p>We now describe two situations where simple analyses that do not include all randomised individuals are approximately equivalent to, and make the same assumption as, more complex analyses that do include all randomised individuals.</p>
<p>First, when a likelihood-based analysis is used, baseline values of the outcome can be included either as a covariate or as an outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1740774512450098">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1740774512450098">54</xref>]. For example, a trial with outcome measured at baseline and one follow-up time can use either an ANCOVA or a mixed model with baseline and follow-up as a bivariate outcome. These methods give identical point estimates and very similar SEs when the baseline is complete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1740774512450098">53</xref>]. They also give very similar results when the baseline is incomplete, provided a suitably modified ANCOVA avoids dropping individuals with missing baselines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1740774512450098">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1740774512450098">56</xref>]. However, the analysis using baseline as an outcome includes all individuals with the outcome observed at baseline or follow-up, whereas the analysis using baseline as a covariate includes only those individuals with the outcome observed at follow-up.</p>
<p>Second, MI may be a computationally convenient alternative to a likelihood-based analysis (section ‘Multiple imputation’), and it typically includes all individuals in the analysis; but in the absence of strong auxiliary variables, MI may be inferior to likelihood-based analysis unless the number of imputations is large enough to minimise Monte Carlo error. However, authors’ desire to include all randomised individuals in the analysis favours MI: for example, in a trial of a web-based self-help intervention for problem drinkers, the authors claimed, ‘We then performed intention-to-treat analysis, using MI to deal with loss to follow-up’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1740774512450098">57</xref>].</p>
<p>In both cases, requiring all randomised individuals to be included in the analysis would invite analysts to adopt an unnecessarily complex analysis, with consequent greater opportunity for human error.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section23-1740774512450098">
<title>Case study: the UK700 trial</title>
<p>We use the UK700 trial to illustrate both the ITT analysis strategy and our arguments above. This trial compared intensive case management with standard case management for 708 people with severe mental illness living in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1740774512450098">58</xref>]. We consider two outcomes here as follows: psychopathology score (Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS)) and satisfaction with services (SAT), which were measured in interviews at baseline, year 1, and year 2. A third outcome, days in hospital for mental health reasons (HOS), was recorded at baseline and year 2 from hospital notes and therefore had few missing values.

<title>ITT analysis strategy for UK700</title>
<p>For point 1, attempts were made to follow up all randomised individuals. For point 2, we need a plausible assumption for a main analysis. In this mental health setting, individuals with missing values may have worse psychopathology and greater dissatisfaction than observed individuals, and their psychopathology and dissatisfaction may have worsened over time. Thus, neither the LOCF assumption nor MAR seems entirely satisfactory. The published analysis was based on an MAR assumption, and here we follow that, recognising that sensitivity analysis to departures from MAR will be essential. We can make the MAR assumption more plausible (and possibly gain precision) by including in the analyses the third outcome, HOS, which is more completely observed than CPRS and SAT; this will be done in a sensitivity analysis. The assumption underlying LOCF cannot be amended to account for the HOS.</p>
<p>The chosen main analysis is therefore a mixed model for CPRS or SAT, using all the observed data at all three time points, and is adjusted for trial centre and the baseline value of the outcome variable. The covariate effects vary by year (i.e., the model includes interactions between year and covariates); treatment effects also vary by year but are absent at baseline. The outcome covariance matrices are unstructured but equal across arms. The estimated intervention effect (95% confidence interval) is −0.39 units (−2.40 to + 1.62) on CPRS and −0.35 (−1.15 to + 0.45) on SAT.</p>
<p>For the SAT analysis, 101 randomised individuals have missing baseline values but one or more observed outcomes. Suitable methods for including these individuals in the analysis can be surprisingly simple because the role of baseline covariates in randomised trials is only to increase power and not to remove confounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1740774512450098">55</xref>]. Thus, mean imputation methods, which are inappropriate for missing covariates in nonrandomised studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1740774512450098">59</xref>], are appropriate for missing baseline values in randomised trials, provided that the imputed values respect the independence of the baseline values and randomised group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1740774512450098">55</xref>]. In the analysis described above, missing baseline values of SAT were imputed by the centre-specific mean of the observed baseline values.</p>
<p>For point 3, we require sensitivity analyses exploring the impact of departures from the MAR assumption: we illustrate them for the CPRS outcome. The main analysis assumed that <italic>δ</italic> = 0, as defined above. Positive values of <italic>δ</italic> indicate that missing individuals have worse psychopathology than observed individuals, which seems the likely direction of departure from MAR in a mental health context. Let <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> be the fractions of individuals with missing outcome at the final time in the intervention and control arms, respectively. In the UK700 data, <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.12 and <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.20. The sensitivity analysis is done by adding a quantity Δ to the treatment effect estimated under the MAR assumption, where Δ = <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>δ</italic> if data depart from MAR in the intervention arm only, Δ = -<italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>δ</italic> if data depart from MAR in the control arm only, and Δ = (<italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub> – <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub>)<italic>δ</italic> if data depart from MAR in the same way in both arms. We allow <italic>d</italic> to take values from 0 to 10: since the standard deviation (SD) of CPRS is 13.8 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774512450098">Table 1</xref>), this represents a fairly wide range. We make the approximation that the SE of the parameter estimate is unaffected by the sensitivity analysis: other work, the subject of a future report, shows that this approximation works well over a wide range of <italic>δ</italic>. More generally, we could allow <italic>δ</italic> to take values <italic>δ</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>δ</italic><sub>0</sub> in the intervention and control arms, respectively, so that Δ = <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>δ</italic><sub>1</sub> – <italic>f</italic><sub>0δ</sub><sub>0</sub> . A fuller treatment of sensitivity analysis, including expert elicitation of the range of values for <italic>δ</italic>, is given in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1740774512450098">60</xref>].</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740774512450098">Figure 3</xref> shows how the estimated intervention effect varies in the sensitivity analyses. Departures from MAR have more impact in the control arm than in the intervention arm because <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> &gt; <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub>. Under MAR, the trial shows no significant benefit of intervention. For this conclusion to be changed would require missing CPRS values to average some 8 points (more than half a SD) more than the observed values in the control arm only, which seems relatively implausible.</p>

<p>A second sensitivity analysis uses MI with auxiliary variables to make better use of the observed data and to make the MAR assumption somewhat more plausible. The auxiliary variables are the baseline and follow-up values of the other two outcomes (HOS and CPRS for SAT; HOS and SAT for CPRS). MI is implemented by the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774512450098">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1740774512450098">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1740774512450098">62</xref>]. Monte Carlo error is reduced by using 1000 imputed data sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1740774512450098">63</xref>]. The estimated intervention effect (95% confidence interval) is −0.43 units (−2.43 to + 1.58) on CPRS and −0.40 (−1.20 to + 0.39) on SAT, which show much less difference from the main results than does the sensitivity analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740774512450098">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
<p>For point 4, all randomised individuals are included in this set of analyses, because each missing individual contributes to one of the quantities <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub> or <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub>.</p>

<title>Comparison of different analyses</title>
<p>We further perform mixed model, LOCF, and MI analyses to illustrate our arguments about the harmful consequences of requiring inclusion of all randomised individuals in the main analysis.</p>
<p>We first consider analyses ignoring the year 1 data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1740774512450098">Table 3</xref>, top part), thus illustrating results for a trial with outcome measured at one time point. ANCOVA with mean-imputed missing baselines and a mixed model with baseline as outcome give almost identical results for CPRS and very similar results for SAT; greater differences are expected for SAT since it has more missing values at baseline. MI, using a basic imputation model including all variables from the analysis model, gives results very similar to the other methods. However, these three analyses that give similar results, and rest on similar assumptions, include very different numbers of individuals.</p>

<p>We next consider analyses using data from all three time points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1740774512450098">Table 3</xref>, lower part). The LOCF estimate differs substantially from all the other estimates for CPRS, and has smaller SE because its implicit assumption allows more information to be drawn from individuals with missing data: this suggests that greater caution needs to be attached to the LOCF analyses. The mixed model analysis of available cases gives very similar estimates whether baseline is included as a covariate or as an outcome. MI using a basic imputation model agrees closely with mixed model analysis of available cases, and MI using the extended imputation model shows small changes as noted above. Again, methods based on the same missing data assumption – mixed models on available cases, whether with a baseline as outcome or covariate, and with MI using the basic imputation model – give very similar answers, as theory suggests, despite including very different numbers of individuals.</p>
<p>These results illustrate that the choice of assumption matters far more than how many individuals are included in the analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We believe that excessive focus on including all individuals in the analysis of randomised trials with missing outcomes can lead to a choice of analysis that rests on implausible or unnecessarily complex imputation. In the ITT analysis strategy, we have therefore proposed that the main focus in choosing the analysis should be the plausibility of its assumptions, while inclusion of all randomised individuals is a requirement only for sensitivity analyses.</p>
<p>Our approach has been to obtain the best possible estimate of the intervention effect. Some analyses, particularly LOCF, are popular because they are believed to be conservative, but this is misguided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774512450098">20</xref>]. It is hard to be sure that an analysis is conservative without attempting to compare it with an unbiased estimate of the intervention effect. We believe that conservatism is best achieved by attempting unbiased estimation but appropriately allowing for the uncertainty due to the missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1740774512450098">46</xref>].</p>
<p>We have discussed incomplete quantitative outcomes. Our proposal for an ITT analysis strategy applies equally well with other types of outcome. However, some different modelling issues arise. For trials with repeatedly measured incomplete binary outcomes, when interest lies in a treatment effect on the log odds scale, complications arise because of the differences between ‘population-averaged’ and ‘subject-specific’ approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1740774512450098">64</xref>]. The goal of ITT analysis is usually a population-averaged odds ratio, which can be directly estimated by generalised estimating equations and MI, but not by mixed models, which directly estimate the subject-specific odds ratio. For trials with time-to-event outcomes, the missing data are the censored outcomes, and in practice, the plausible assumption about the missing data is nearly always that censoring is non-informative (similar to an MAR assumption). Methods for sensitivity analysis to informative censoring are not well developed.</p>
<p>Our considerations have led us to propose a framework for ITT analysis with missing data that complements and extends the CNSTAT report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512450098">4</xref>]. We believe that if trialists follow this framework, then there is scope for considerable improvement in the appropriateness, consistency, and reporting of ITT analyses when outcomes are missing. However, the best approach to missing data is always to design and conduct the trial to maximise data collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512450098">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512450098">3</xref>]. A careful ITT analysis strategy, and in particular an appropriate sensitivity analysis, recognises the increase in uncertainty that arises from missing outcomes, and therefore increases the incentive for researchers to maximise their data completeness.</p>
