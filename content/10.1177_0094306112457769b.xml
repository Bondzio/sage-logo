<p>This slim volume contains the results of a mixed-method empirical examination of important questions about how we should think about the consequences of men’s physical violence and control on women’s poverty and on women’s ability to comply with welfare eligibility requirements. These questions, of course, are of obvious practical importance given the 1996 laws requiring women receiving welfare to move quickly into employment. Questions about relationships between poverty and abuse have been of continuing theoretical importance because factors contributing to poverty also are associated with abuse, making it difficult to untangle causal mechanisms.</p>
<p>Lisa Brush’s argument takes place over 126 pages of text separated into six chapters, followed by a methodological appendix, extensive reference list, and notes. The methodological appendix contains a detailed explanation of the multiple data sets used in this analysis. First, there are longitudinal interviews (one initial and a maximum of three follow-up) with 40 women transitioning from welfare to work. Snippets from these interviews appear throughout the book. Second, there is a “person-period” data set (assembled by Brush from several sources) including repeated measures of petitions for protection from abuse court orders from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, all welfare recipient records (AFDC/TANF) from the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, and quarterly data on earnings from the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry’s Bureau of Unemployment and Benefits Administration. The final data set containing these wage and welfare data on 27,017 women across a five-year time span is used in the text to discuss statistical relationships between poverty, abuse, and welfare. Third and finally, there are data from a “community literacy project” led by the author and her colleague, English professor Lorraine Higgins. Eight women receiving welfare worked on a eight-week writing project, crafting their personal stories. These data are used to demonstrate critical differences between policy assumptions about women’s experiences and women’s understandings of their own lives.</p>
<p>The main text is laid out in six chapters. Chapter One is an introduction presenting an overview of the study and its topics, including what we know about how battering interferes with women’s employment. The goal of the analysis is described as bringing new data to bear on the connections among battering, work, poverty, and welfare (p. 17). Chapter Two, “Conventional Wisdom and Its Discontents,” begins by describing—and challenging—popular beliefs such as: poverty has individual-level causes, work decreases women’s vulnerability to abuse, and individual women should be “empowered” to demand the end of abuse. A feminist structural analysis follows as an alternative approach for thinking about poverty, welfare, and abuse and this is used to examine the key characteristics of welfare and abuse policy. Chapter Three, “What Happens When Abusers Follow Women to Work?” draws from interview data to explore the multiple ways in which abuse interferes with women’s employment—there are conflicts about work, conflicts and abuse that interfere with women’s ability to work, and abusers and abuse that follow women to work. Chapter Four, “Calculating the Costs of Taking a Beating,” uses the longitudinal quantitative data to address a range of questions: Which comes first, petitioning for a protective order because of violence or going on welfare? How do welfare recipients who petition for protective orders differ from other welfare recipients? Did changes associated with welfare rescission have the same effect on the earnings of welfare recipients who do and do not petition for protective orders? Chapter Five, “Welfare Recipients Talk Back,” turns to data from the writing project to address how women, themselves, understand their life histories and how they think about their problems and needs. Finally, Chapter Six is a relatively short summary of empirical findings and ends with a call to bring a social justice approach to the public policy surrounding welfare.</p>
<p>This book contains a great many insights about relationships among poverty, welfare, and abuse. For example, we learn that in the long run, women known to be experiencing abuse work just as much as women not reporting abuse, that emphasizing employment does not offer the key to resolving the interrelated problems of poverty and battery—even though women themselves believe employment is the key to their autonomy. Furthermore, the quantitative, longitudinal data do not support the conservative hypothesis that welfare causes battering, and they show that welfare and restraining orders are important resources for women attempting to escape the traps of poverty and abuse. The chapter featuring women’s stories as they write them also vividly demonstrates of how public notions of women’s lives can be far different from those lives as actually lived and experienced.</p>
<p>Most certainly, this book will be an important resource for scholars interested in the perplexing problems of relationships between abuse and poverty and how the organization of U.S. welfare policy influences women’s abilities to escape both. At the same time, it likely will not attract a more general audience. Simply stated, while packed with insights, this book is not easy to read. Descriptions of the statistical manipulations of longitudinal data in the appendix, as well as discussions of the perils of measuring the “costs” of abuse in the text are examples of careful scholarship, yet they require a considerable understanding of measurement and advanced knowledge of statistics. In the same way, the complexity of argument, detailed examinations of theoretical underpinnings, and discussions of contradictory research findings and thought on relationships between poverty and abuse require careful, slow reading to comprehend. Yet while I would not recommend this book for undergraduates it might be an excellent book for graduate students because, in addition to covering obviously important content, it could be used to demonstrate how sociology can be both theoretically sophisticated and relevant to the practical issues of public policy. This is an example of carefully done and precisely written scholarship. I predict it will win well-deserved honors.</p>
