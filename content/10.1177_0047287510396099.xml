<abstract>
<p>Why do travel and tourism consumers appraise products as more or less favorable, and what makes them change their appraisals over time? In addressing these two fundamental questions, we focus on the construct of consumer value, a construct often regarded as pivotal in determining customer satisfaction and loyalty. In this article, we propose and test a model of the antecedents and consequences of change in consumer value. We used a key sector of the tourism industry, timeshare, as the context for this research. Self-report data were obtained from 580 owners of timeshare on two occasions, 12 months apart. Results from this longitudinal study showed that selected consumer, product, consumption experience, and learning experience factors predicted changes in value, and these value changes, in turn, predicted shifts over time in satisfaction and repurchase intent. The findings provide new insights as to the role of value in consumer appraisals and actions.</p>

<body>
<p>Why do tourism consumers appraise products more or less favorably? One factor underlying these appraisals is the value derived from purchase, ownership, and use of a product. The concept of consumer value has attracted considerable attention in recent years, with several scholars regarding it as critical to both consumer behavior and organizational success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287510396099">Ruiz, Gremler, Washburn, and Carrion 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287510396099">Smith and Colgate 2007</xref>). While authorities typically view value as something that changes and can be modified to enhance customer satisfaction and company profitability, most have studied it using cross-sectional research designs that do not capture its dynamic quality. In contrast, we report a two-wave longitudinal study that examined changes over time in consumer value and probed the causes and consequences of these changes. Our central research questions were as follows: How does value change for the tourism consumer? What antecedent factors explain this change? And how do changes in value relate to changes in outcomes such as customer satisfaction and repurchase intent?</p>

<title>Consumer Value: Definitions, Dimensions, Antecedents, and Consequences</title>
<p>Values are enduring beliefs that have motivational properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287510396099">Rokeach 1973</xref>). Tourism researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287510396099">Gallarza and Gil-Saura 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287510396099">Petrick 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287510396099">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287510396099">Oh 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287510396099">Sanchez et al. 2006</xref>) have made important contributions to knowledge of consumer value. However, issues relating to the definition, dimensionality, antecedents, and consequences of value remain unresolved. These issues are introduced in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>Definitions of consumer value abound. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287510396099">Holbrook (1999)</xref> described it as a consumer’s relative preference for an object or experience, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287510396099">Woodall (2003)</xref> defined it as a “personal perception of advantage arising out of a customer’s association with an organization’s offering” (p. 21). Some writers conceive of value simply in monetary terms (financial value), or as the ratio of quality to monetary and other costs (exchange value) (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287510396099">Johnson, Herrmann, and Huber 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287510396099">Oh 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287510396099">Sweeney, Soutar, and Johnson 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287510396099">Zeithaml 1988</xref>). For the purpose of this study, we follow the approach of Holbrook and Woodall: value is a benefit or advantage, something consumers prize over other things. It is a subjective, contextually based, comparative judgment that varies widely between individuals, between groups, and over time.</p>
<p>Conceptions of the dimensionality of value vary, with a trend toward increasing complexity in recent years (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287510396099">Ruiz et al. 2008</xref>). The dominant contemporary position is that the value consumers derive from a product or service extends beyond financial benefits to include a range of tangible, social, emotional, and other advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287510396099">Smith and Colgate 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287510396099">Sparks, Butcher, and Bradley 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287510396099">Woodall 2003</xref>). The number of value dimensions proposed to pertain to a single product varies from one to more than a dozen. The nature of these value dimensions also varies: types commonly proposed include monetary, functional, emotional, prestige/reputational, and symbolic/self-expressive (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287510396099">Gallarza and Gil-Saura 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287510396099">Holbrook 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287510396099">Lemmink, de Ruyter, and Wetzels 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287510396099">Petrick 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287510396099">Sanchez et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287510396099">Ruiz et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287510396099">Sweeney and Soutar 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287510396099">Woodall 2003</xref>). Indeed, there currently exists no agreed list or typology of customer value. Notwithstanding this, useful attempts to impose order in this field have been made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287510396099">Smith and Colgate (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287510396099">Holbrook (1999)</xref>, who have proposed robust two- and three-dimensional (respectively) conceptual frameworks of consumer value.</p>
<p>Another divisive set of issues pertains to the sources or antecedents of consumer value. Authorities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287510396099">Gronroos 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287510396099">Payne, Storbacka, and Frow 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287510396099">Smith and Colgate 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287510396099">Vargo and Lusch 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287510396099">Woodall 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287510396099">Zeithaml 1988</xref>) variously view consumer value as a property inherent in the product; as resourced, facilitated, and/or created by firms and their marketers; as derived by consumers through product purchase, use, and/or experience; and as <italic>co</italic>-created through interaction and dialog between producers and consumers. Our research is premised on the view that value is multidetermined: consumers anticipate and derive value through many sources—product search, marketing messages, product purchase, direct experience and usage, word-of-mouth advice, and so on. Later in this article, we present a model of changes in value that includes several of these forces.</p>
<p>Debate also exists as to the conceptual and temporal place that value occupies in relation to other marketing and tourism concepts such as quality, trust, satisfaction, loyalty, commitment, (re)purchase intentions, and recommendations to others. There is abundant evidence of positive correlations between these constructs (e.g., Lee, Yoon, and Lee 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287510396099">Lemmink, de Ruyter, and Wetzels 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287510396099">Oh 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287510396099">Ruiz et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287510396099">Upchurch and Rompf 2006</xref>). There is also considerable support for what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287510396099">Gallarza and Gil-Saura (2006)</xref> call a “quality-value-satisfaction-loyalty chain,” that is, a unidirectional causal sequence that leads from product or service quality to the value customers derive, and then to customer satisfaction and other outcomes such as intention to repurchase. Evidence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287510396099">Gallarza and Gil-Saura 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287510396099">Lemmink et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287510396099">Ruiz et al. 2008</xref>) that the links between value and loyalty/repurchase intentions are weaker than those between value and satisfaction is consistent with the idea that satisfaction mediates the value–loyalty relationship.</p>

<title>Value as a Dynamic Construct, and the Need for Longitudinal Research</title>
<p>Most authorities agree that consumer value changes over time. Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287510396099">Sanchez et al. (2006)</xref> observed, value is a “dynamic variable, experienced before purchase, at the moment of purchase, at the time of use, and after use” (p. 394). Despite this likelihood of change, most past studies have used cross-sectional designs and taken only a single measure of value, as if it is an entirely static phenomenon (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287510396099">Lemmink, de Ruyter, and Wetzels 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>This is surprising because longitudinal designs have two major advantages over cross-sectional alternatives. First, they enable many extraneous (“nuisance”) variables to be controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287510396099">Menard 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287510396099">Zapf, Dormann, and Frese 1996</xref>). For example, because longitudinal designs involve measuring predictor and criterion variables at different points in time, the biasing effect of common occasion factors is minimized. If the criterion is also measured at Time 1 and its effects are statistically controlled, researchers can potentially rule out the possibility that Time 2 levels of this variable are due simply to a carryover from Time 1. The influence of response biases, demographic characteristics, personality factors, and other unmeasured variables may also be effectively controlled if it can be assumed that these factors have effects on the criterion that are constant over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287510396099">Menard 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287510396099">Zapf, Dormann, and Frese 1996</xref>). Cross-sectional studies, in comparison, offer few such opportunities for control over nuisance variables.</p>
<p>The second major advantage of longitudinal designs is that they help to identify temporal relations between events. Cross-sectional studies may show, for example, that consumer value, satisfaction, and loyalty covary, but they cannot identify the order in which these phenomena unfold. Longitudinal studies not only demonstrate covariation but can also resolve issues of temporal sequence and, if supported by sound theory and effective control over extraneous variables, can provide strong evidence of causal relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287510396099">Menard 2002</xref>). Such inferences can be made the more compelling by tests that assess and disconfirm models proposing reverse directions of causation.</p>

<title>The Timeshare Industry as a Context in Which to Study Value</title>
<p>Our study was contextualized within the timeshare and holiday ownership industry, an important but underresearched tourism product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287510396099">Upchurch and Rompf 2006</xref>). Given its size and significance, and the many different types of value potentially offered to consumers, the timeshare industry is an ideal context in which to study consumer value. Like other tourism entities, timeshare aims to provide positive vacation experiences in which value is derived from a mix of relaxation and active leisure pursuits, as well as from family and wider social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287510396099">Lawton, Weaver, and Faulkner 1998</xref>). Further to this, unlike many tourism products, timeshare is “owned” for use year after year. Because owners expect value to be derived over a considerable period, timeshare is well suited to longitudinal research. Moreover, timeshare represents an asset, the ownership of which can confer social prestige or status value. Timeshare can also be loaned, or given away as a present. This potential for gift-giving is a source of value to many owners.</p>
<p>In its formative years, timeshare involved ownership of the right to use a “home” resort for a fixed period of time on an annual basis. Gradually, exchange companies entered the market, enabling owners to swap time at their home resort for an equivalent period at another resort. Over the past few decades, these “weeks-based” timeshare products have been purchased less often than have so-called points-based products, in which a bundle of points is purchased and later traded for other products. Whereas once consumers could request to exchange their timeshare only for another form of accommodation, they can now go online and exchange their timeshare for a diverse range of products (e.g., a cruise, car hire). These and other developments have implications for consumer value. For example, with the widening range of options available to owners, the flexibility value of the product has been enhanced; as booking systems are modified, its convenience value changes; and, as resort locations multiply, the product becomes more valuable as a provider of new experiences.</p>
<p>It follows from the above that the value derived from timeshare extends beyond the financial to include a range of other benefits, all of which may be experienced differentially by individual timeshare owners. We focus on 11 dimensions of value: financial, quality, fun activities, rest and relaxation, gift-giving, flexibility, new experience, status and esteem, family, socializing, and convenience value. In our past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287510396099">Sparks, Butcher, and Bradley 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287510396099">Sparks, Bradley, and Jennings, forthcoming</xref>), we have developed and refined a self-report instrument to measure value in this tourism context. We have demonstrated the structure of our value model to be robust across owner groups (including groups of non–timeshare owners) and have shown each of the value dimensions to be associated with owner satisfaction and willingness to recommend timeshare. Prior to the current work, however, we have not explored change over time in consumer value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0047287510396099">
<title>Theoretical Model of Change</title>
<p>Underpinning this research is a theoretical model that identifies four kinds of factors that drive change in consumer value. From the most proximate to the most remote, these sources of change are as follows: direct consumption experiences, experiences learning about the product, consumer and product characteristics, and broader contextual and historical factors (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287510396099">Payne, Storbacka, and Frow 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287510396099">Smith and Colgate 2007</xref>). Below, we elaborate on these sources of change, and we illustrate each by reference to some specific variables within each category that were measured in the current study. While the model of change is applied here to value derived through timeshare ownership, it is applicable to other products and services.</p>
<p>The first likely source of change is the quality and quantity of consumers’ direct, personal experiences (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287510396099">Berry 2000</xref>). Consumers’ perceptions of value can change through experiences buying, using, and in other ways interacting with a product. In the context of timeshare, the experience of a pleasant vacation is likely to enhance consumer value, while vacations that do not meet expectations, or vacations that are postponed or cancelled because of resort unavailability, are likely to adversely affect value perceptions. Importantly, different types of experiences affect different types of value: a timeshare vacation that entails nonstop adventure or cultural activities, for example, may enhance assessments of new experience value but weaken convictions as to the rest and relaxation opportunities provided by timeshare. Our research thus involved asking owners about their recent timeshare experiences, and predicting value change based on their responses.</p>
<p>The second category of influence on change in perceived value is the learning experiences consumers have in relation to the product. In contrast to “firsthand” personal experiences of a product, this source is vicarious or “secondhand”: it relies on information obtained from other people (e.g., sales personnel) or media (e.g., instruction manuals, product websites). The importance of this source is likely to increase with product complexity. Within the timeshare context, examples include product information received when attending sales presentations, advice for effective timeshare use provided as part of owner education seminars, and word-of-mouth recommendations from fellow owners. Thus, we asked owners about their experiences learning about the benefits (and costs) of timeshare, and we predicted that such exposure would precipitate value change.</p>
<p>The third broad category of factors relates to characteristics of the consumer and of the product. The inclusion of this source of influence is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287510396099">Holbrook’s (1999)</xref> notion that value is personally and situationally dependent: all consumers have their own value priorities, and all products offer differentiated value possibilities. In our research, we examined the impact on value of several demographic, vacation preference, vacation expectations, and timeshare product variables. While each of these antecedent variables may have direct and moderating effects on value, the emphasis in our model is on their indirect effects, that is, those effects that are mediated through consumption experiences.</p>
<p>We illustrate first using some attributes of consumers. As a first example, there is likely to be divergence between the value assessments of owners who are highly restricted in their vacation options and those of owners who have greater flexibility as to when and where they holiday. In times of high demand for accommodation, the more flexible group, but not the more restricted group, is likely to secure accommodation that they deem acceptable. As a consequence, the two groups will have different vacation experiences, and these will likely result in different value judgments. As a second example, perceptions of value may vary with the expectations consumers hold of a product: perceived value is likely to be higher when expectations are modest and hence readily met. In the timeshare context, owners who expect to secure accommodation at a premium resort with little advance notice are likely to report declining ratings of value if their last-minute requests for accommodation exchanges are denied and their vacation experiences are less than satisfactory as a consequence.</p>
<p>Changes in consumer value also vary as a function of the product owned. In the context of timeshare, the most important product distinction is between the ownership of weeks-based and points-based entitlements. Type of product may affect many aspects of the timeshare experience, and these varying consumption experiences may, in turn, produce different kinds or rates of change in value perceptions. For example, compared to owners of weeks-based products, owners of points-products are likely to visit more resorts, in different locations, and this is likely to contribute to sustainably high ratings of flexibility value and new experience value. In contrast, these kinds of value may decline over time among owners of weeks-based products.</p>
<p>Another product variable likely to have a mediated effect on changes in value is duration of ownership. Immediately after purchase, consumers may experience a “honeymoon period” during which they report particularly positive value perceptions. Over the next period of ownership, consumers may become increasingly adept at optimizing the utility of their product. In the timeshare context, for example, owners may develop strategies for securing exchanges into highly sought-after resorts. Successful exchanges are likely to result in enhanced consumption experiences that, in turn, lead to elevated perceptions of value. However, later in the ownership cycle, the product may lose its freshness appeal. Novel experiences may occur with decreasing frequency, and value assessments may decline accordingly.</p>
<p>The fourth broad category of factors affecting change relates to economic, cultural, and historical events. An example pertinent to the current study is the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, an event that had its major impact at a time between our first and second waves of data collection. Value perceptions may decline to the extent that this crisis placed financial stress on timeshare owners. Other contextual factors possibly affecting change in value perceptions include changes in demand for accommodation from international tourists and exposure to extreme weather conditions.</p>
<p>In sum, we expected that most timeshare owners’ perceptions of value would change over the one-year period of our study. Such changes are likely to be caused partly by direct personal experiences, partly by communications from others, partly by characteristics of the consumer and/or the product owned, and partly by external events.</p>

<title>Aim and Hypotheses</title>

<italic>Hypothesis 1(d)</italic>: increases over time in value ratings are more evident in owners who report few (rather than many) restrictions in their vacation preferences.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Our second hypothesis was based on the proposition that value ratings vary with the learning and consumption experiences consumers have with a product. Specifically, we predicted that the value derived from timeshare becomes more favorable following involvement in these learning experiences:</p>

<p>In addition, we predicted the following:</p>

<p>Our final hypothesis was based on the proposition that value affects satisfaction directly and that it affects repurchase intent only indirectly, through satisfaction. Specifically, we predicted the following:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0047287510396099">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were recruited in two ways. First, three timeshare companies, a timeshare exchange company, and a timeshare resale company randomly selected samples of existing timeshare owners from their databases. The second recruitment strategy involved the same timeshare companies mailing a questionnaire to all people who purchased from them during the most recent three-month period. All owners who completed questionnaires in response to either of these approaches were invited to complete a second questionnaire, approximately 12 months after their initial involvement. In total, 704 people returned a completed questionnaire on both occasions. Response rates were 15% to 25%, but are uncertain for several reasons. For example, to comply with privacy legislation, the companies were entrusted with questionnaire dispatch, resulting in uncertainty as to the number of questionnaires sent in total and the number sent to incorrect addresses and ineligible persons.</p>
<p>Inspection of the questionnaires returned on both occasions revealed some data that were missing not completely at random. Deletion of problematic cases resulted in a final sample of 580 owners of timeshare (129 of whom were recent purchasers at Time 1). This sample was gender-balanced: 288 males (49.7%) and 292 females (50.3%). Ages ranged from 21 to 84 years (<italic>M</italic> = 52.9 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.0). Approximately two-thirds (69.2%) of respondents were born in Australia. While the majority (81.2%) were married, only one-third (33.8%) had children younger than age 18 years living with them. About half (52.6%) were employed full-time, with most of these working in professional or managerial positions. In terms of education and income, 39% held a university degree and 33% reported an annual household income in excess of AU$100,000. Almost one-third (31.1%) owned a weeks-based timeshare product, with 64.1% owning a points-based product and 4.8% owning both types of timeshare. At Time 1, duration of timeshare ownership ranged from one week to 33 years (<italic>M</italic> = 6.4 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0047287510396099">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>At the two data collection points, participants completed a 12-page questionnaire. Unless otherwise specified, items were identical on the Time 1 and Time 2 questionnaires. Responses to the value, satisfaction, and repurchase intent items were on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>
<sec id="section9-0047287510396099">
<title>Consumer value</title>
<p>The scale measuring consumer value has been developed and validated by the current authors over several years using classic scale construction techniques (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287510396099">Netemeyer, Bearden, and Sharma 2003</xref>). We began with reviews of the literature, individual and focus group interviews, and expert panels and proceeded through a series of quantitative studies of timeshare owners and nonowners in which the scale’s factorial structure, reliability, and validity were established and confirmed. See Sparks, Butcher, and Bradley (2007) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287510396099">Sparks, Bradley, and Jennings (forthcoming)</xref> for further details and a copy of the full scale.</p>
<p>Three scale items measured each of 11 dimensions of value. Respondents indicated the value they derive from timeshare, using the following statement as a precursor: “I feel that I receive VALUE out of the USE of my timeshare ownership because. . . .” Sample items (and the value dimensions they represent) are “It makes me relax” (rest and relaxation), “It is great value for money” (financial), “I can meet and socialize with new people on my holiday” (socializing opportunities), and “It offers the opportunity to experience new places and ways of life” (new experiences).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0047287510396099">
<title>Satisfaction</title>
<p>Three items measured global satisfaction with timeshare (“Overall, I am satisfied with my timeshare ownership,” “Overall, timeshare meets my expectations,” and “Overall, I am happy with my timeshare”). This three-item scale has been used in our previous studies and has demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0047287510396099">
<title>Repurchase intent</title>
<p>Two items were used to measure intent to purchase additional timeshare (“I intend to buy additional timeshare sometime soon” and “I may purchase additional timeshare some time in the future”). These two items correlated <italic>r</italic> = .74, at both times.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0047287510396099">
<title>Vacation preferences/expectations, and recent timeshare experiences</title>
<p>Four questions were included on the Time 1 questionnaire to assess vacation preferences and expectations (e.g., “How flexible are you with the places you go on holidays?”), and twelve items were included in the Time 2 questionnaire to assess consumption and learning experiences of timeshare within the preceding year (e.g., “Since [one year earlier], have you participated in education/information seminars on how to use your timeshare more effectively?” “Since [one year earlier], how often, if at all, have you attempted to exchange your timeshare weeks/points for another resort or product, but were unsuccessful in this attempt?”). Happiness with recent timeshare use was assessed by way of a three-item scale (e.g., “I really enjoyed my recent timeshare experience”; Cronbach’s alpha = .91). In addition to these 12 items, others (e.g., one relating to recent discussions with family and friends about timeshare) failed to discriminate and are not discussed further.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0047287510396099">
<title>Demographic characteristics and timeshare ownership details</title>
<p>Items were included in the Time 1 questionnaire to gather information about the respondent’s gender, age, marital status, family status (1 = <italic>have children under 18 years coresiding</italic>, 0 = <italic>do not</italic>), employment status (employed full-time vs. not), educational attainment (6-point ordinal scale), household income (6-point ordinal scale), type of timeshare product owned, and duration of ownership.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0047287510396099">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All data were collected via anonymous questionnaires, with respondents recording unique codes to permit matching of their Time 1 and Time 2 responses. At both times, questionnaires were sent and returned by the same medium, either by mail (35%) or online (65%). Lottery tickets and offers of a summary of the study findings were used as incentives to encourage participation. Time 1 survey packages were sent at various times between November 2007 and July 2008, with Time 2 questionnaires distributed 50 to 54 weeks later. This time lag provided an adequate opportunity for respondents to use their timeshare and for their experiences to have an effect, it was a sufficient duration to neutralize short-term testing effects, it ensured that any extraneous seasonal influences were stable, and it avoided the large participant attrition and memory lapse problems likely to be associated with longer interwave intervals. Completed questionnaires were accepted for six weeks after being sent. For owners who received their questionnaire by e-mail, participating companies were requested to send a reminder e-mail two weeks after initial dispatch.</p>

<title>Confirmatory Factor Analyses</title>
<p>Our first analyses were multigroup CFAs that tested the stability of the measurement model pertaining to the dimensions of value, satisfaction with timeshare, and repurchase intent. Within this model, all scale items were specified as loading on a single designated factor, and all cross-loadings and error covariances were constrained to zero. The Satorra-Bentler robust chi-square statistic was interpreted (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287510396099">Du Toit et al. 1999</xref>). Matrices from Time 1 and from Time 2 were stacked in a single analysis, and maximum likelihood estimation procedures were employed. In the base model, item loadings and factor variances and covariances were estimated freely for each wave of data collection. Fit statistics pertaining to this model are given in the first row of results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287510396099">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>As can be seen, the model provided a very good fit to the data, indicating that the hypothesized thirteen-factor model was valid at Times 1 and 2. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287510396099">Byrne (1998)</xref>, in a second multigroup analysis, corresponding Time 1 and Time 2 factor loadings were constrained to be equal. See row 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287510396099">Table 1</xref>. The chi-squared difference test revealed that this restriction resulted in a nonsignificant reduction in model fit, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(25) = 45.8, <italic>ns</italic>, thereby evidencing invariance of the loadings over time. In a third multigroup analysis, the variances of, and covariances between, the latent variables were also constrained to be equal across times. This restriction yielded a nonsignificant increase in chi-square compared to the second model, Δχ<sup>2</sup> (91) = 27.5, <italic>ns</italic>, evidencing no reduction in model fit when these further equality constraints were applied. In sum, the 13-factor structure, the size of the factor loadings, and the size of the latent variable variances and covariances did not differ significantly between waves of data collection. Measurement stability was thus established. In two additional CFAs (shown in the lower half of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287510396099">Table 1</xref>), the fit of the measurement model was very good at Time 1 and at Time 2.</p>

Correlations between the value scales ranged from .21 to .65. Stability coefficients (i.e., autocorrelations from Time 1 to Time 2) ranged from .56 (for quality and flexibility values) to .68 (for status and esteem value). The stability coefficient for satisfaction with timeshare was .68 and for repurchase intent was .64.</p>

<title>Time 1 consumer and product variables as antecedents of the consumption experience, learning experience, consumer value, and dependent variables</title>
<p>Analyses were conducted to assess relationships between seven demographic variables (gender, age, marital status, family status, employment status, education, and income), four vacation preference/expectation variables, and two timeshare product variables (type and length of ownership), on one hand, and the remaining study variables, on the other. Among the analyses involving consumer and product variables, the following were most significant: (1) age was positively correlated with frequency and duration of timeshare use, but negatively correlated with the proportion of exchange attempts that were successful; (2) compared to lower-income owners, higher-income owners were less likely to have attended a sales seminar but more likely to have experienced success in their exchange attempts; and (3) owners of weeks-based products and longer-term owners reported greater timeshare use, whereas points-based owners and recent purchasers more often attended sales and education seminars and reported success in timeshare exchange.</p>
<p>Difference scores in each of the value dimensions and DVs were computed by subtracting respondents’ Time 1 score from their corresponding Time 2 score. Analyses were performed to assess the associations between the change-in-value variables and the demographic and timeshare ownership variables. These analyses include tests of Hypothesis 1. The demographic and ownership variables were unrelated to change in 8 of the 11 value scales. Of particular note, contrary to Hypothesis 1(a), there was no association between changes in new experience value and type of timeshare owned. The demographic and ownership variables were, however, associated with change in three values—financial, quality, and flexibility. Ratings on these three values declined more markedly among owners of points-based products than among owners of weeks-based products. Mean changes for these two ownership groups were, respectively, (a) financial: –0.38 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.19) and –0.12 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.03), <italic>p</italic> = .013; (b) quality: –0.37 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.13) and –0.05 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.02), <italic>p</italic> = .001; and (c) contrary to Hypothesis 1(b), flexibility: –0.33 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.14) and +0.23 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.07), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Duration of ownership was positively correlated with the same three change-in-value scores: financial value (<italic>r</italic> = .11), quality value (<italic>r</italic> = .13), and flexibility value (<italic>r</italic> = .18). In these cases, respondents who had owned timeshare for longer durations reported smaller declines in value. Change in flexibility value also varied with age (<italic>r</italic> = –.10) and income (ρ = –.12), and was greater among those who reported having coresiding children (<italic>M</italic> = −0.28, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.16) than among those without (<italic>M</italic> = −0.06, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.12), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .028.</p>
<p>Change in satisfaction with timeshare was associated with two of the demographic and product variables: it was positively correlated with duration of ownership (<italic>r</italic> = .09; longer-term owners displayed smaller declines in satisfaction), and it was greater among respondents who were not employed on a full-time basis (<italic>M</italic> = −0.42) than among those employed full-time (<italic>M</italic> = −0. 20), <italic>t</italic>(578) = 2.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Change in repurchase intent was positively correlated with ownership duration (<italic>r</italic> = .10; large reductions in repurchase intent were most evident among those who had owned fewer than five years), and it was greater among owners of points-based timeshare than among owners of weeks-based products (<italic>M</italic>s = −0.40 vs. –0.15, respectively), <italic>t</italic>(549) = 2.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>The upper section of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287510396099">Table 3</xref> summarizes the results of tests of the effects of the vacation expectations and preference variables on changes in each of the 11 value variables and the DVs. As can be seen, consistent with Hypothesis 1(c), as Time 1 expectations of booking duration increased, the Time 1–Time 2 change in four of the value dimensions became more positive (or, actually, less negative). Contrary to Hypothesis 1(d), change in two value dimensions varied with owner interest in making diverse use of their timeshare: those less interested reported smaller declines in value over time.</p>

<p>In sum, the major correlates of change in the value dimensions and in the dependent variables were the product variables (type and duration of timeshare ownership), with declines in customer evaluations most evident among respondents who owned a points-based product and/or who had owned for shorter periods.</p>

<sec id="section19-0047287510396099">
<title>Timeshare consumption and learning experience variables as antecedents to the value dimensions and dependent variables</title>
<p>In this section, we examine the role of 11 consumption and learning experience variables (measured, through retrospective account, at Time 2) as possible influences on change in consumer value and the two DVs. These analyses include tests of Hypothesis 2. The lower section of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287510396099">Table 3</xref> summarizes the results of tests of the impact of the experience variables on changes in each of the value variables and DVs. Several conclusions can be drawn. First, all but one of the 11 experience variables was associated with significant changes over time in at least one of the criterion variables (the exception was the number of successful timeshare exchanges in the past year). Second, consistent with Hypothesis 2, ratings of at least some of the values became more favorable following each of (1) exposure to sales presentations, (2) attendance at educational seminars, (3) high ratings of the usefulness of seminars, (4) purchase of additional timeshare, (5) few failures in achieving sought-after timeshare exchanges, (6) extent and duration of recent timeshare usage, and (7) satisfaction with recent usage. Third, consistent with our fully mediated causal model, only two of these variables were associated with changes in satisfaction and none was associated with changes in repurchase intent.</p>

<title>Consumer Values as Antecedents to Satisfaction and Repurchase Intent</title>
<p>Correlations were computed between all possible pairs of <italic>changes in</italic> the value dimensions and <italic>changes in</italic> the DVs. In accord with Hypothesis 3, all correlations between changes in value and change in satisfaction were positive and significant (all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001, mean <italic>r</italic> = .33), with the strongest links to change in satisfaction associated with changes in financial (<italic>r</italic> = .53), convenience (<italic>r</italic> = .50), and flexibility (<italic>r</italic> = .47) values and the weakest associated with gift-giving value (<italic>r</italic> = .14). Consistent with Hypothesis 4, change in satisfaction was positively correlated with change in repurchase intent (<italic>r</italic> = .30). The consumer value–repurchase intent correlations ranged from .21 for financial value to –.02 for gift-giving value (mean <italic>r</italic> = .10). The modest size of these correlations, relative to the corresponding value–satisfaction correlations, is consistent with Hypothesis 5b.</p>
<p>Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to identify a parsimonious subset of the values that predict change in each of the DVs. The first analysis sought to predict change in satisfaction with timeshare. Predictors were entered as follows: (Step 1) Time 1 satisfaction, (2) demographic and timeshare ownership variables that had previously been shown to correlate with the criterion, and (3) the 11 change-in-value variables. Results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0047287510396099">Table 4</xref>. As shown, with all variables entered, Time 1 satisfaction, employment status, and changes in each of financial, convenience, flexibility, rest and relaxation, quality, and status value contributed significantly to the prediction of Time 2 satisfaction. The finding that six of the change-in-value dimensions predicted changes in satisfaction is consistent with Hypothesis 3.</p>

<p>A second regression analysis was conducted with change in repurchase intent as the criterion. One modification was made to the predictor set, namely, change in satisfaction was added at a fourth step (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0047287510396099">Table 4</xref>). At Step 3, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> change = .04 (vs. .22, in the equation predicting satisfaction). After Step 3, change in only one of the value variables (financial value) predicted Time 2 repurchase intent. After Step 4, change in satisfaction was significant but change in financial value was not. These findings support Hypothesis 5.</p>

<title>Putting It All Together: Modeling the Antecedents and Consequences of Change in Consumer Value</title>
<p>Results reported in the previous section provide evidence consistent with the causal model that specifies links from consumer value, through satisfaction, to intentions to purchase additional timeshare. The final stage of the data analysis involved testing a series of structural models of the antecedents and consequences of consumer value. Selection of variables to be included in these models was based on the findings reported above.</p>
<p>Eighteen of the study variables were excluded from the structural models because of large amounts of missing data and/or failure to predict the DVs. The remaining demographic variable (income), two timeshare ownership variables (type and duration), two vacation preference/expectation variables (flexibility over timeshare usage, and estimated booking period), three consumption experience variables (recent purchase, recent use, and number of recent unsuccessful exchange attempts), six value dimensions (measured at Times 1 and 2), and the two DVs (also measured at both times), were included in all models. Duration of timeshare ownership was square root–transformed to reduce skew. After listwise deletion, 399 cases were available for analysis.</p>
<p>The value dimensions and the DVs were treated as latent variables; all other variables were measured. All variables measured at Time 1, plus recent timeshare purchase at Time 2, were exogenous. The remaining Time 2 variables were endogenous. Covariance matrices were used as input and maximum likelihood estimation procedures applied. All models included paths between correlated exogenous variables, and auto-covariances between the disturbances of each latent variable measured on both occasions.</p>
<p>Five models were tested in an order consistent with the causal links specified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287510396099">Figure 1</xref>. The first model included the measurement parameters, the covariance paths listed in the previous paragraph, and the Time 1–Time 2 stability paths for each of the latent value and dependent variables. All stability parameters were highly significant (<italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001), and the model provided a good fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(1325) = 2557.1, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.93, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .040, comparative fit index (CFI) = 1.00, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .057. In Model 2, based on the earlier bivariate analyses, three paths were added as predictors of consumption experiences: income as a predictor of number of unsuccessful exchange attempts, duration owned as a predictor of recent timeshare usage, and product type also predicting recent usage. The first two, but not the third, of these parameters were significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The addition of these paths resulted in a model fit that was superior to that of the first model, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 107.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In Model 3, the antecedents of value change were added. This involved freeing up the 14 paths to the Time 2 latent value variables from the vacation preference/expectation and timeshare experience variables that were shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287510396099">Table 3</xref> to predict change in value. This model fitted the data better than did Model 2, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(14) = 110.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, with 9 of the 14 additional paths significant.</p>
<p>Model 4 assessed whether the six value dimensions predicted change in satisfaction. Addition of a path from each of the Time 1 values to Time 2 satisfaction yielded a model that better fitted the data than did Model 3, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(6) = 40.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Significant effects on satisfaction were found for each of rest and relaxation value, financial value, and status value (although the latter had a negative sign, indicating a likely suppression effect). Quality, convenience, and flexibility value did not contribute significantly. Finally, our hypothesized model, Model 5, additionally tested whether satisfaction predicted change in repurchase intent. The fit of this final model was very good, χ<sup>2</sup>(1301) = 2287.4, 1, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.76, RMSEA = .036, CFI = 1.00, SRMR = .055, Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) = 2655.4. Adding the single path from Time 1 satisfaction to Time 2 repurchase intent resulted in a better fit than in Model 4, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 11.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Finally, we compared the fit of our hypothesized model with several reciprocal and reverse-direction alternatives. Results were consistent with our theoretical model of change. Details are available from the first author.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Consumer value has been posited as a core construct within marketing and tourism, yet knowledge of its dimensionality, stability, antecedents, and consequences is uncertain. The current study sheds light on these issues.</p>
<sec id="section23-0047287510396099">
<title>Structure and Stability of Consumer Value</title>
<p>Consistent with the views and data reported by others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287510396099">Gallarza and Gil-Saura 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287510396099">Holbrook 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287510396099">Smith and Colgate 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287510396099">Woodall 2003</xref>), our study was premised on the belief that consumer value is multifaceted, subjective, product-dependent, and variable over time. In the current research, we tested and confirmed an 11-factor model, further validated our scale measuring these dimensions of value, and provided evidence that our measurement model is stable over time. While our study was contextualized in the timeshare industry, many of the value dimensions (e.g., financial, convenience, quality, social), and the findings pertaining to them, are relevant to other tourism products. We focused on changes in value ratings, and observed that owners’ evaluations of timeshare declined remarkably during the year-long study period. Significant reductions were evident in 8 of the 11 dimensions of perceived value. This is a substantively interesting finding, especially in the light of evidence that the decline does not appear to be due to an attrition bias or to a testing effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0047287510396099">
<title>Antecedents of Change in Consumer Value</title>
<p>We developed and provided an initial test of a general theoretical model of the antecedents of change in consumer value. Correlates of change were found belonging to several variable categories in our model: consumption experiences, learning experiences, product factors, and consumer factors.</p>
<p>Within the category of consumption experiences, for example, changes in value were associated with use of timeshare in the preceding year, duration of any such use, and participant happiness with the nature of this use. In addition, experiences exchanging timeshare had significant effects on value change, albeit asymmetrical ones, with unsuccessful attempts associated with marked declines in rest and relaxation, socialize, quality, and convenience value, while successful exchanges were essentially unrelated to changes in perceived value.</p>
<p>Numerous learning experience factors were also predictive of change in perceived value. For example, attending either a sales presentation or an owner education seminar during the study year was associated with increases in two types of value (gift-giving and family): perhaps these two areas are the ones that are emphasized in these presentations, or perhaps the potential for deriving value of these two types is not apparent to owners without strategic intervention from timeshare company personnel. Changes in value also varied with ratings of the usefulness of the education seminars. These findings have practical implications for industry managers and marketers in that they suggest avenues through which consumer value can be enhanced.</p>
<p>Several of the timeshare product factors and timeshare owner (“consumer”) factors were associated with changes in perceived value. For example, type of timeshare owned (whether weeks- or points-based) was predictive of changes in three of the value variables. However, the nature and direction of the findings were not as expected. Thus, contrary to Hypothesis 1(a), declines in new experience value did not vary with type of timeshare owned, and contrary to Hypothesis 1(b), flexibility value declined more markedly among points-based than among weeks-based owners (when the reverse was expected). The finding that financial and quality value perceptions also declined to a greater extent in points-based than in weeks-based owners is worthy of further investigation. If replicated elsewhere, this has possible implications for the future configuration of products offered by timeshare companies. In other findings, value ratings varied with owners’ vacation booking expectations and vacation flexibility. These expectations and lifestyle flexibility factors predate timeshare ownership, thus suggesting that only some of the influences upon value are within the scope of managerial intervention.</p>
<p>Not only were variables within our model predictive of value change, but findings were broadly consistent with our view that consumer- and product-related effects are indirect; that is, they affect value perceptions by influencing the nature and extent of timeshare consumption experiences. For example, duration of ownership predicted a range of <italic>consumption</italic> experiences (e.g., extent of recent timeshare use, number of unsuccessful exchange attempts) and <italic>learning</italic> experiences (e.g., education seminar attendance) that, in turn, predicted changes in the perceived value of timeshare. Similarly, ratings of three values declined more markedly among owners of points-based products than among weeks-based owners. This may be explained by findings that weeks-based owners were more likely than points-based owners to have used their timeshare, and thus had more satisfying consumption experiences during the study period. Furthermore, type of timeshare ownership was related to expectations of the period of time owners needed to book in advance, and, as noted above, these expectations were positively correlated with change in value.</p>

<sec id="section25-0047287510396099">
<title>Consequences of Change in Consumer Value</title>
<p>If consumer value is indeed a pivotal variable within consumer behavior, it should have important consequences. Prior cross-sectional research provides only weak evidence of such consequences in the form of contemporaneous correlations between value, satisfaction, and other outcomes. We expected and found that at both Times 1 and 2, all 11 value dimensions were positively related to owners’ satisfaction and repurchase intentions. This aspect of our research, like past studies, leaves unresolved the temporal ordering of key variables.</p>
<p>The longitudinal design of our study enabled us to extend past research and begin identifying temporal relations. Consistent with Hypothesis 3, changes in all 11 value dimensions were correlated with change in satisfaction. Follow-up multiple regression analyses revealed that 6 of the values predicted satisfaction. Each of the value dimensions that was a significant and unique predictor represents a specific example of one of the broader categories of value proposed in models proposed by past writers (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287510396099">Smith and Colgate 2007</xref>). These convergent findings offer partial confirmation of both the current and the past conceptualizations of consumer value.</p>
<p>As hypothesized, structural equation modeling confirmed that (a) consumption experience variables predicted change in the value dimensions; (b) the values predicted satisfaction; and (c) with satisfaction in the model, the values did not have significant direct effects on repurchase intent. These findings provide general support for the quality → value → satisfaction → repurchase full-mediation model proposed by other writers. Past studies have found cross-sectional evidence consistent with this sequential model when applied to cruise vacationers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287510396099">Petrick 2004</xref>), luxury hotel patrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287510396099">Oh 1999</xref>), student travelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287510396099">Gallarza and Gil-Saura 2006</xref>), and other tourism segments. A major contribution of the current research is to confirm this model in a different field of tourism (timeshare) using longitudinal data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0047287510396099">
<title>Evaluation of the Study and Recommendations for Future Research</title>
<p>Four aspects of the current study warrant critical examination. First, the research design had both strengths and limitations. On the one hand, our non-experimental method prevented causal relations being inferred. On the other hand, however, our panel design permitted firmer conclusions about temporal sequencing than has been the case in past research into consumer value. In future research, attempts should be made to collect data at multiple points in time, separated by varying intervals, in order to track the rate and direction of change. Second, data were obtained exclusively through self-report measures. This meant that response biases may have influenced the assessment of single variables, and common method variance may have affected the assessment of relations between variables.</p>
<p>Third, Australian timeshare owners comprised the entire sample. A possible advantage of such a homogenous sample and narrow product focus is that the confounding effects of some extraneous variables (e.g., cultural differences, socioeconomic factors) are reduced. Nonetheless, the collection of data in relation to other travel and tourism products, from consumers in other countries, is required to test the robustness of our theoretical model. Finally, we relied on participating companies for questionnaire distribution. This resulted in some loss of data. While the total sample size was adequate for present purposes, the use of larger samples in future research will enable more predictors of value to be included in the models and will permit finer-grained testing of between-subgroup differences in value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0047287510396099">
<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>Two of the major lessons from this research are as follows. First, consumer value is not necessarily stable; it can deteriorate quite quickly over time. Second, value is positively linked to satisfaction and, in turn, to repurchase intent. Therefore, from the perspectives of both customers and companies, consumer value is a volatile, yet pivotal, thing. The current findings can assist in identifying those specific dimensions of value that are most likely to change over time, and those most likely to affect satisfaction and repurchase. In the current study, for example, financial value was more highly correlated with change in satisfaction than was any of the other value dimensions. However, our regression analyses revealed that other dimensions of value (e.g., rest and relaxation, quality, convenience, and flexibility value) independently predicted increases in owner satisfaction. To the extent that financial value is a <italic>necessary</italic> condition for customer satisfaction, firms need to manage their product in ways that minimize costs; to the extent that financial value is not a <italic>sufficient</italic> condition for satisfaction, firms also need to be alert and responsive to diverse opportunities to use value to build customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>In addition to these implications relating to the <italic>effects</italic> of value on satisfaction, the current findings pertaining to the <italic>antecedents</italic> of value have implications for value creation. Most authorities agree that value is cocreated by consumers and the firms with which they interact, and that both parties can thus play a role in establishing and sustaining value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287510396099">Gronroos 2008</xref>). Many examples of ways in which timeshare companies can act as value facilitators and value cocreators can be offered. Timeshare companies can, for example, provide advice regarding efficient use of booking systems so as to help create convenience value; they can package their products in new and innovative ways to enhance flexibility value; they can host “welcome” cocktail parties for new owners and thus build socializing value; they can organize tours and cultural displays, participation in which will enhance new experience value; and through their marketing, they can associate their brand with high-status people and locations, thus building esteem value. Furthermore, given the current findings that education seminar attendance is positively associated, and experience of failed attempts at timeshare exchange is negatively associated, with perceptions of value, these owner experiences require particularly careful management.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study has made several contributions to our understanding of consumer value. First, we provided evidence in support of an 11-factor model of value and the further validation of a self-report scale to measure these value dimensions. Second, we presented a general model of factors underpinning change in consumer value, and we illustrated the application of this model to a major industry within the tourism sector. Third, we provided an initial test of this model. Using longitudinal data, we identified several antecedents (consumption experiences, learning experiences, consumer, and product factors) and consequences (satisfaction, repurchase intent) of change in consumer value. The study is a rare example of longitudinal research into tourist behavior. It provides a base for future multiwave studies of consumer value and suggests some practical implications for managers interested in enhancing, and benefiting from, consumer value.</p>
