<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this concept analysis of good death was to examine the attributes of a good death and explore the changes of the concept over time and its impact on terminally ill patients. The method used for this analysis was the Rodgers’ evolutionary method. A literature search was completed using Medline Ovid and Journal Storage (JSTOR).The findings describe the evolution of the good death concept over time from the prehistoric era followed by premodern, modern, and postmodern times. In addition, information is presented about surrogate terms, attributes, antecedents, and consequences associated with good death followed by analysis and discussion of the findings. General attributes of a good death include pain and symptom management, awareness of death, patient’s dignity, family presence, family support, and communication among patient, family, and health care providers.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>In 2009, approximately 2.5 million people died in the United States. The 3 leading causes were cardiac disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory diseases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111434976">1</xref>
</sup> During the period from 2003 to 2007, almost 29% of patients with cancer died in hospitals in the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111434976">2</xref>
</sup> Of note, the New Jersey and New York regions had higher rates of mortality of patients with cancer in hospitals (41%-47%) than in the Iowa region (7%).<sup>2(p4)</sup>
</p>
<p>Studies suggest that too often patients die in hospitals with poor quality of life. The Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) found that a large number of critically ill hospitalized patients experienced prolonged deaths with the use of invasive life-sustaining medical treatments and that the communication among physicians, patient, and family was deficient.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111434976">3</xref>
</sup> Other studies have reported similar findings, including poor pain and symptom management in hospitalized seriously ill patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111434976">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111434976"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111434976">6</xref>
</sup> and lack of effective communication between intensive care unit (ICU) physicians and families.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111434976">7</xref>
</sup> Currently, the advances in science and medicine have made “living easier and dying harder.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111434976">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Throughout history, humans have always tried to answer questions about death and dying: who are we? How should we live our lives if we are going to die? Is there anything after death?<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111434976">9</xref>
</sup> To answer those questions, the concept of good death has been investigated by various disciplines including sociology, anthropology, psychology, and theology. Sociology and anthropology have explored the influence of cultural values on death and dying; psychology has concentrated on the emotional responses related to death; and theology has provided probably the most significant contribution about the influence of religion on coping with death.<sup>9(p19)</sup> Recently, a critical review of the literature integrated the viewpoints of Christian theology, medicine, and nursing, and all disciplines agreed that a good death comprises the following elements: making appropriate preparations, control of symptoms, presence of social support, and being spiritually at peace.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111434976">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The purpose of this article was to explore the concept of good death in terminally ill patients. The concept of good death touches the core of the dying experience and involves a combination of factors including the occurrence of physical symptoms, feelings of loss and grief, existential concerns, family and community support, satisfaction with life, and the hope for a good journey after death. Following the growth of the palliative care movement over the last decade and the concomitant increased awareness of the right-to-die movement, exploring the concept of good death in terminally ill patients is indeed timely.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A literature search was conducted with Medline Ovid and JSTOR databases using a combination of keywords death and dying, quality care, concept exploration, and history. The only limits included humans and English. A wide time frame between 1950 and 2010 was considered appropriate to capture concept changes over time. The 198 publications from Medline Ovid were reviewed against the inclusion criteria resulting in a total of 39 publications. The search in JSTOR combined the keywords good death and definition with a result of 4201 publications. The first 100 abstracts were reviewed against the inclusion criteria resulting in 10 publications. Each publication was assigned to 1 of the 3 categories—nursing (11), medicine (23), and sociology (15). During the reviewing process of the identified articles, other appropriate articles were identified and added to the relevant citations.</p>
<p>The evolutionary method by Rodgers<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111434976">11</xref>
</sup> was used to conduct this concept analysis. This method is an inductive and circular approach to analysis. The purpose of which is to identify the <italic>state of the art</italic> regarding the concept. The evolutionary method includes the following activities: (1) identify the concept of interest and surrogate terms, (2) identify and select setting and sample for data collection, (3) identify attributes of the concept, (4) identify antecedents and consequences of the concept, (5) analyze data regarding the above characteristics, (6) identify exemplar of concept, and (7) identify hypotheses and implications for further development of the concept.<sup>11(p85)</sup>

<title>Good Death: The Evolution of a Concept Over Time</title>
<p>The concept of good death has changed over generations. A historical review of the death and dying experience including good death will follow.</p>
<sec id="section4-1049909111434976">
<title>Prehistorical Time (2500000-4000 BCE)</title>
<p>Tens of thousands of years ago, in the <italic>Stone Age</italic>, one of the most important aspects of the history of death occurred: the <italic>anticipation</italic> of death and dying as a human experience.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111434976">12</xref>
</sup> Different from other animals, humans were able not only to recognize death but also to anticipate it. Anticipation of death impacted humans in 2 ways: one, they became aware of danger, so they worked to protect themselves better; and two, they began to inquire about life after death. This was evident in prehistoric cave drawings of burial rites as a first attempt to understand death.<sup>12(p27)</sup> During the Stone Age, death occurred very suddenly by either accidents or human and animal predation, allowing no time for preparation or reflection. In this context, a time of social transition for the dying person did not happen as a predeath experience. Instead, the dying experience was viewed as a postdeath activity depending on how the survivors behaved on behalf of the dead.<sup>12(p25)</sup> A <italic>good passing</italic> in the Stone Age was not defined by how well the person died but rather by the type of good or bad journey he or she would have in the other life based on the survivors’ beliefs.<sup>12(p29)</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049909111434976">
<title>Historical–Premodern Time (3500 <sc>bc</sc>-15th century)</title>
<p>After the hunters and collectors of the Stone Age, human culture developed into the <italic>Pastoral Age</italic> characterized by sedentism, peasantry, and farming.<sup>12(p67)</sup> Different from the Stone Age, the dying experience in peasants and farmers involved more predicted deaths, mostly associated with infectious diseases such as smallpox, malaria, and dysentery among others.<sup>12(p83)</sup> These diseases led to a <italic>gradual</italic> <italic>dying</italic> process that allowed the person to actually participate in his or her own dying.<sup>12(p84)</sup>
</p>
<p>In the Pastoral Age, a death that allowed the dying to prepare for death with the assistance of family and community was considered a <italic>good death</italic>.<sup>12(p86)</sup> In addition, the belief was that life itself was the preparation for death; in other words, a good death was the result of a life well lived.<sup>12(p85)</sup> Similarly, Aries<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111434976">13</xref>
</sup>described death in the Middle Ages as a communal event where the dying person was accompanied by family and friends, which the author labeled <italic>tamed death</italic>. Further, the concept of good death of peasants and farmers was transformed in the early years of the 20th century as a consequence of various social and political events, such as the rise of the industrial revolution, the occurrence of wars, and the changes in healthcare systems.<sup>12(147),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909111434976">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049909111434976">
<title>Historical–Modern Time (16th–20th Century)</title>
<p>At the turn of the 20th century, the good death of the Pastoral Age that occurred at home transitioned to another type of good death that took place in medical institutions. The healthcare system in the United States developed rapidly after World War II, with hospitals assuming a critical role in the delivery of health care.<sup>14(p25)</sup> Health care’s principal focus on acute care changed the death experience from home-based death to medicalization of death that occurred in hospitals for most cases (Foley &amp; Gelband, 2001). Death in the hospital became a technical event controlled by the medical team.<sup>13(p88)</sup>
</p>
<p>According to Kellehear,<sup>12(p149)</sup> the concept of good death transitioned to <italic>managed death</italic> which included awareness of dying and participation of healthcare professionals in the event of dying through managing different aspects of the dying process. Death was no longer viewed as part of the journey of life but rather as a medical failure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111434976">15</xref>
</sup> However, not everybody agreed with the institutionalization of death. Indeed, the power of doctors over the dying person by taking over the hospitalization and making the decision of where the patient should die was considered by some to be a type of depersonalization and marginalization of patient and family.<sup>9(p72)</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049909111434976">
<title>Postmodern Time (1950-Present)</title>
<p>In the middle of the 20th century, the values and attitudes regarding the modern concept of death were challenged by professionals from different disciplines. Glaser and Strauss<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049909111434976">16</xref>
</sup> influenced by the fact that American people did not talk about death and dying decided to conduct a large field observational study at 6 hospitals in the San Francisco metropolitan area. The investigators examined the type of interactions between dying patients and health care professionals. The central finding was that any difference among disciplines was highly related to the degree of awareness about the patient’s dying. There was an <italic>open awareness</italic> when both patient and healthcare providers knew that the patient was dying and the dying process was made transparent.<sup>16(p79)</sup>
</p>
<p>The awareness of the dying theory generated a dramatic change in the attitudes and practices of health care providers toward death and dying.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909111434976">17</xref>
</sup>This change is reflected in the definition of good death by the Institute of Medicine, “<italic>decent or good death</italic> is one that is free from avoidable distress and suffering for patients, families, and caregivers; in general accord with patients’ and families’ wishes; and reasonably consistent with clinical, cultural, and ethical standards.”<sup>8(p 24)</sup>
</p>
<p>Parallel to Glaser and Strauss’ work, the hospice and palliative care movement developed as a result of recognized inadequacies in the care provided to dying patients in the medical curative system.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049909111434976">18</xref>
</sup> In 1967, the opening of St Christopher’s hospice in London by Cicely Saunders marked not only the beginning of the hospice movement worldwide, but most importantly the creation of a framework of care for the dying.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049909111434976">19</xref>
</sup> Saunders<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049909111434976">20</xref>
</sup> developed the concept of total pain that included the physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of the dying person and emphasized on the importance of symptom control and the use of a team approach to meet the needs of patients and families at the end of life. Similarly, Elizabeth Kübler-Ross<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049909111434976">21</xref>
</sup> worked in New York with terminally ill patients and developed the theory of the stages of dying, which included a series of emotional conditions in those who are dying with the ultimate goal of reaching peace by accepting death.</p>
<p>Later the World Health Organization (WHO)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049909111434976">22</xref>
</sup> expanded the definition of palliative care beyond the care of dying patients to the care of any patient affected by a life-threatening illness. Palliative care is an interdisciplinary approach that focuses on the improvement of quality of life of patients and their families through prompt identification and management of physical symptoms, and psychosocial and spiritual needs.<sup>22(p1)</sup> The WHO emphasized that a fundamental element of a good death was the relief of pain, so the patient would be physically and emotionally able to accomplish his or her goals before death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049909111434976">23</xref>
</sup> In the United States, after the publication of the SUPPORT study in 1995, the palliative care movement gained momentum resulting in the implementation of an increased number of palliative care programs in hospitals throughout the country.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049909111434976">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, the right to die movement has used the concept good death synonymous with euthanasia. In fact, the term euthanasia comes from the Greek words <italic>eu thanatos</italic> that means good death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049909111434976">25</xref>
</sup> Euthanasia has been defined as “active mercy killing and as personal freedom from unwanted interference in one’s own life.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049909111434976">26</xref>
</sup> Hardwig describes good death as the new art of dying which is about “the deeply human task of recognizing the right time and then bringing a life to a close.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049909111434976">27</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, euthanasia is legal and widely accepted; considered essential, by some, for a good death. For example, Rietjens and collaborators<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049909111434976">28</xref>
</sup> found that the majority of participants in a Dutch study believed that euthanasia was an acceptable option to achieve the desired characteristics of a good death such as saying farewell, dying pain free, with dignity, and maintaining control.</p>
<p>Similarly, at the center of the palliative care philosophy is the belief that each of us has the right to die pain free and with dignity, and patients' preferences for care ought to be honored.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049909111434976">29</xref>
</sup> Thus, while there is agreement between the right to die and palliative care movements as to what constitutes a good death; there is disagreement as to the means to achieve such death.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049909111434976">
<title>Surrogate Terms and Related Uses of Good Death</title>
<p>Surrogate terms help to express the concept of good death by using other descriptive words or phrases. Surrogate terms enhance the concept of good death by enlarging its contextual basis.<sup>11(p92)</sup>
</p>
<p>Callahan<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049909111434976">30</xref>
</sup>discussed a <italic>peaceful death</italic> and how at the end of this process the outcome can be either positive or negative. The outcome is positive when in fact a peaceful death is accomplished. A peaceful death combines personal, medical, and social elements, such as finding meaning in one's own death; being treated with respect, sympathy, and dignity; hoping that one's own death matters to others; not being abandoned; not being a burden to others; being conscious and mentally intact until the very end; and hoping for a quick death with no pain or suffering. The outcome is negative when <italic>dying is deformed</italic> by altering the dying process, the dying self, or the community of the living. Deforming the dying process is the result of excessive medical interventions that leads to a prolonged period of suffering before death. Deforming the dying itself occurs when fear of death takes control of individuals’ self-worth, making them think of only their losses and failures. Deforming the community of the living is when the fear of death and suffering give way to social and political changes created to relieve pain and suffering at all costs including assisting in suicide. Walters<sup>15(p408)</sup> introduced the concept of <italic>dying with panache</italic> which refers to a more realistic way of dying than having a good death. Dying with panache means to die on one’s own terms. This may include components of disapproval and uneasiness as well as expressions of anger and humor, and likely with some unresolved business but with integrity and honesty. <italic>Smooth death</italic> is considered a positive death by physicians, when the patient dies comfortably and the dying is not prolonged.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049909111434976">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Hales, Zimmermann, and Rodin<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049909111434976">32</xref>
</sup> differentiated among 3 major end-of-life concepts: quality of life at the end of life, quality of dying and death, and quality of care at the end of life. <italic>Quality of life at the end of life</italic> includes physical, psychosocial, and spiritual domains. <italic>Quality of dying and death</italic> integrates the domains of quality of life with other domains relevant to dying such as life closure, death preparation, and conditions of death. <italic>Quality of care at the end of life</italic> contains all the domains related to the dying experience, but it refers to how the health care system meets the needs of the dying person and his or her family. Similarly, Stewart, Teno, Patrick, and Lynn<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049909111434976">33</xref>
</sup> stated that the concept of <italic>quality of life of dying patients</italic> includes domains that are usually found in health-related quality-of-life concepts, but the difference lies in how the domains are defined and operationalized. The domains include physical comfort, psychological well-being, social functioning and well-being, spiritual well-being and meaningfulness of life, physical functioning, cognitive functioning, overall perceived quality of life, and quality of dying of patients. For example, physical functioning traditionally assesses limitations in walking, reaching, climbing stairs, and so forth; but in terminally ill patients, physical functioning focuses mostly on activities of daily living. In addition, the domain quality of dying of patients refers to “being free of avoidable distress and suffering for patients and families, in accord with patients’ and families’ wishes, and reasonably consistent with clinical, cultural, and ethical standards.”<sup>33(p100)</sup> Overall, quality of life at the end of life focuses more on being at spiritual peace and comfort.</p>
<p>Moreover, Patrick, Engelberg, and Curtis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049909111434976">34</xref>
</sup> stated that <italic>quality of life at the end of life</italic> differs from quality of dying in that quality of life focuses on actions and experiences while living with a terminally ill disease, and <italic>quality of dying</italic> focuses on getting ready for experiencing death itself. In summary, surrogate terms to the good death concept provide a wide range of terms that go from the identification of key elements of a peaceful death, to the quality of the dying process itself, thus expanding the concept of good death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049909111434976">
<title>Attributes of a Good Death</title>
<p>Good death is defined by its attributes. A review of the literature on good death identified common attributes to a good death from the point of view of health care providers, patients, and families: relief from pain and suffering, being aware of dying, accepting the timing of one’s death, acceptance and autonomy, keeping hope alive, preparing for departure, and making the decision about where to die.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049909111434976">35</xref>
</sup> In addition, the\ literature revealed that most of what is known about good death comes from families’ and healthcare providers’ opinions but very little from patients’ opinions.<sup>35(p104)</sup> Because of the subjective character of the dying experience, these attributes may vary depending on whose perspective it is, patient, or family, or health care provider. The attributes of good death from the perspectives of the health care provider, and patient and family are described below and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049909111434976">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Health Care Provider</title>
<p>Nurses are likely the professionals who have closely observed more deaths than any other profession. From the nurses’ perspective, a good death requires high standard of care which involves optimal symptom management and holistic care provided to both patient and family.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049909111434976">36</xref>
</sup> Palliative care nurses identified attributes of a good death related to the patient, the family, the team, type of death, and the death scene<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049909111434976">37</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049909111434976">Table 1</xref>). Further, nurses believe that a good quality of death must include the following elements: availability of a protocol for end-of-life care, a higher nurse-to-patient ratio, anticipation of death by the nurse, having a surrogate decision maker designated by the patient, having a do-not-resuscitate order or advanced directives, optimal pain control, and family presence at the time of death.<sup>5(p870)</sup>
</p>
<p>Nurses agree that a good death is more likely to occur in the hospice setting<sup>36(p1504)</sup>; however, it can also take place in any hospital setting. Nurses working on acute care units are confronted with providing high standards of end-of-life care in a curative-oriented environment. A grounded theory study of nurses working in acute medical settings revealed that nurses created a <italic>haven for safe passage</italic> when caring for terminally ill patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049909111434976">38</xref>
</sup> This <italic>haven for safe passage</italic> is characterized by 4 processes that nurses identify as important to provide good quality of care at the end of life: one, <italic>facilitating and maintaining a lane change</italic> refers to the open recognition of imminent death by the patient, family, and clinicians, and therefore, changing the goals of care from curative to palliative; two, <italic>getting what’s needed</italic> refers to developing an appropriate care of plan for the dying person that focuses on symptom management and comfort care; three, <italic>being there</italic> refers to provide support to patient’s family; and four, <italic>manipulating the care environment</italic> refers to making changes in the physical setting to create a peaceful and private atmosphere for patient and family.<sup>38(p172)</sup>
</p>
<p>Physicians are major players in patients’ dying process. A mixed qualitative and quantitative study was conducted in two large academic hospitals in the United States<sup>31(p942)</sup> on the topic of how physicians described the most powerful death experienced during their professional careers. The findings indicated that physicians’ perceptions of patient deaths were grouped into categories of time and process, medical care and treatment decisions, and communication and negotiations. Good death encompassed expected, peaceful, and timely death; rational/coherent, appropriate comfort care; and effective communication with patient, family, and providers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049909111434976">
<title>Patient and Family</title>
<p>Two additional qualitative studies described attributes related to a good death according to the patients’ and families’ perspectives. These attributes included appropriate pain and symptom management, avoiding prolonged dying process, attaining a sense of control, alleviating burden, and strengthening relationships with family and friends.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049909111434976">39</xref>
</sup> Further, Nelson and collaborators<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049909111434976">40</xref>
</sup> identified 4 major domains related to high quality of palliative care: (1) well-timed, clear, and compassionate communication by clinicians, (2) patient-focused decision making that refers to respecting patient’s values and treatment preferences, (3) clinical care of the patient that refers to physical comfort, and respect for dignity, personhood, and privacy, and (4) care of family that refers to facilitate access and proximity of family to patients, and emotional support to family during the critical period of disease progression and the dying process.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049909111434976">
<title>Antecedents</title>
<p>In sum, a good death is the result of a number of factors that can be grouped into patient factors, organization performance, and health care provider factors.</p>
<sec id="section13-1049909111434976">
<title>Patient Factors</title>
<p>Patient factors comprise personal and social environment consisting of patient’s clinical condition (diagnosis, severity, and trajectory of illness), patient’s and family’s financial situation and concomitant life issues.<sup>33(p95)</sup> In addition, cultural values and religious beliefs of patients and families play a significant role in promoting a good death. For example, families embracing Buddhist philosophy of peaceful death used the law of karma and reincarnation to facilitate the spiritual journey of their loved ones who were dying of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049909111434976">41</xref>
</sup> Moreover, the type of disease affects individuals’ dying experience because of both the distinctive dying trajectory and the severity of symptoms. For example, while patients with cancer usually lose function in the last month of life, patients with cardiac disease may decline for years and then die suddenly of arrhythmias.<sup>33(p105)</sup> Also, patients with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often experience more severe symptoms of dyspnea and anxiety than patients dying of other medical conditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049909111434976">42</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The disease trajectory affects the decision concerning the site where people may die. Although many people would prefer to die at home, they often die in institutions mostly in long-term care facilities not necessarily because of the acuity of the disease but because of its chronic nature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049909111434976">43</xref>
</sup> The results of a study of family members of patients with late-stage dementia found that 28% of the family caregivers felt that a good death cannot happen for a person with dementia or who dies in a nursing home because of both the suffering associated with a prolonged disease and the institutionalized character of the nursing home.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049909111434976">44</xref>
</sup> Additionally, a qualitative study looking at the attitudes of elderly individual in relation to home as a place for a good death suggest that for older people home was more than a physical place, home also denotes meaning familiarity, comfort, and the company of family and friends.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049909111434976">45</xref>
</sup> In fact, older people would prefer not to die at home because of fear of becoming a burden to family, but they would like to have the presence of their loved ones at the time of their passing.<sup>45(p463)</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049909111434976">
<title>Organization Performance</title>
<p>A good death for terminally ill patients can be affected by a number of elements that impact the dying process including the structure and processes of care.<sup>33(p95)</sup> The <italic>structure of care</italic> consists of access to end of life care, organization of care provided by healthcare professionals, availability of support services, and the physical environment to provide optimal quality of care to the dying.<sup>33(p95)</sup> The <italic>process of care</italic> involves technical process (appropriate symptom management and coordination of care), decision making process (opportune communication, honor of patient’s preferences, and advance care planning), information and counseling to patient and family, and compassion and cultural sensitivity.<sup>33(p97)</sup> Similarly, Trotta (2007) described 3 relevant factors that play an important function in providing a good quality death: context, conditions, and processes. The <italic>context</italic> refers to the environment in which the dying occurs, such as, policy and regulations of the institution, institutional culture and characteristics, clinical staff education, and role and staffing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049909111434976">46</xref>
</sup> The <italic>conditions</italic> refer to the processes that assist or impede a good death, such as the personal attribute of humanism of the healthcare providers necessary for advance care planning and determination of trajectory and prognosis.<sup>46(p1120)</sup> Health care professional’s misconceptions can negatively affect the care they provide to patients at the end of life. For example, physicians tend to assume that cognitively impaired patients do not have any meaning in living and have no control in their lives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049909111434976">47</xref>
</sup> Finally, the <italic>processes</italic> comprise pain and symptom management, psychosocial issues, and holistic care.<sup>46(p1122)</sup>

<sec id="section15-1049909111434976">
<title>Consequences</title>
<p>Little is known about the impact of a good death on the major stakeholders such as patient’s families, health care professionals, and health care institutions. However, efforts have been made to measure the quality of dying or quality of care at the end of life. Family satisfaction is a principal approach to evaluate various aspects of the dying process including staff’s interpersonal skills, technical expertise, and provision of comprehensive care. However, for families a good death may include other aspects of care related to emotional support during and after death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049909111434976">48</xref>
</sup> For example, the Veterans Affairs health care system developed a family satisfaction assessment tool to measure the quality of care of veterans at the end of life nationwide.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049909111434976">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049909111434976">50</xref>
</sup> Other studies have developed different methods to measure end of life care outcomes including conceptual models.<sup>34(p721),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049909111434976">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049909111434976">52</xref>
</sup>; mixed measurements integrating professionally determined measures and patient and family-centered measures<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049909111434976">53</xref>
</sup>; a theory-based quality of dying and death questionnaire<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049909111434976">54</xref>
</sup>; and a disease-specific questionnaire for end-stage renal diasease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049909111434976">55</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, Hattori, McCubbin, and Ishida<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049909111434976">56</xref>
</sup> suggest that consequences of a good death include family satisfaction and healthy bereavement process, work satisfaction for health care providers, and positive patient outcomes for health care institutions.</p>

<sec id="section16-1049909111434976">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The concept of <italic>good death</italic> has changed significantly over time. From the prehistoric time when death was nonparticipatory, meaning that the dying person did not play a part in his or her own death, but rather death was experienced by his or her survivors; to the premodern time, when death happened at home involving the dying person, the family, and the community; to modern time, when death occurred in hospitals controlled by physicians, with little or no participation of the dying person and his or her family in determining goals of care; to nowadays, a death that occurs both at home and institutions with a major emphasis on patient’s autonomy and respect for patients’ preferences.</p>
<p>Currently, decisions regarding death and dying are more difficult due to a number of circumstances: high utilization of medical technology, a variety of dying sites (home, hospitals, nursing homes, and hospices), the growth of palliative care programs, and the strengthening of the right-to-die movement. Advances in medicine have generated a different type of death which is illustrated by Pascalev<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049909111434976">57</xref>
</sup> in 2 ways, one is the metaphor of war, meaning death is the enemy; therefore, it is necessary to use all the technology available to fight death; and two is the cheechee metaphor, meaning death is torture, which refers to the recognition of the imminent death; however, death must be preceded by intensive treatment. The cheechee metaphor comes from a popular joke in which tribal natives captured 2 people. The natives asked the first person whether he wanted cheechee or death, the person answered “cheechee.” The natives proceeded to torture the person using horrible techniques. Then, the natives asked the second person the same question: cheechee or death? After having seen what cheechee meant, the second person answered: “death.” The natives said yes, but first a little cheechee. The cheechee metaphor describes the impression that clinicians are providing a treatment that is both futile and painful.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049909111434976">58</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Further, the parallel growth of both the palliative care movement and the right-to-die movement has created ambivalence about new paths of dying. What is striking is that these 2 movements endorse patient’s autonomy in decision making as a major priority.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049909111434976">59</xref>
</sup> This is important especially when patients choose not to follow the good death route as described by the majority of people and decide to fight death until the end. Saunders, Ross &amp; Riley<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049909111434976">60</xref>
</sup> question the <italic>normal</italic> <italic>of a good death</italic> depicted in a case in which the patient is a young man who decides that he wants to live. “Suppose he died an awful death (as perceived by healthcare professionals) in the ambulance. He might consider this a good death because he would have died fighting for his life.”<sup>60(p205)</sup>
</p>
<p>In sum, the attributes of good death found most frequently in the analysis of this article are the following: pain and symptom management, patient’s dignity, family presence, family support, awareness of death, and good communication among patient, family, and health care team. These are the attributes of the ideal good death. However, as it was stated above, the definition of good death is subjective, and it may vary from person to person, and may be fighting until the end for some could be another attribute of a good death as well.</p>
<p>The antecedents of a good death are clearly linked to both patient’s characteristics and organization performance. If the health institution has the correct infrastructure and processes in place to provide excellent care to the dying patient, the result is a good death. The consequences of a good death are connected to patient outcomes but mostly to family satisfaction. However, there are few studies investigating the impact of a good death on the survivors, the health care professionals, and the health organizations.</p>

<sec id="section17-1049909111434976">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article provides an evolutionary concept analysis of good death in terminally ill patients. The concept of good death transitioned over time. A distinction is made between the current definitions of good death by the palliative care movement and the right-to-die movement. While both movements respect patient’s decisions and have as ultimate goal, a good and peaceful death, the means to accomplish it are substantially different.</p>
<p>The antecedents and consequences of a good death identified through this analysis offer implications for further research. For example, antecedent studies looking at patient factors and organization structure could identify predictors of either a good death or a bad death. Similarly, outcome studies investigating the impact of a good death on patients, families, and organizations are crucial.</p>
