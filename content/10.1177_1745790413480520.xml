<abstract>
<p>We describe patterns of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with biologics in the United States during 2000–2010 using longitudinal data in the IMS LifeLink™ health plan claims database. Rheumatoid arthritis prevalent and incident cases were identified by ICD-9 diagnostic codes. The proportion of prevalent rheumatoid arthritis cases using biologics increased from 18.7% in 2005 to 26.3% in 2010. Tumor necrosis factor α antagonists constituted 99.1% of biologics in 2005 and 84.4% in 2010. During 2000–2010, 58.1% of incident cases were treated with 1st-line non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or corticosteroids and 36.5% were treated with 1st-line synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Biologics constituted 5.4% of 1st-line therapies for incident rheumatoid arthritis cases and 30.9%–56.3% of 2nd-to-≥5th line therapies. For those who started on 1st-line non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/corticosteroids, the duration of pharmacotherapy before switching to biologics was 7.2 years for those starting biologics in 2005–2007 and 4.2 years for those starting biologics in 2008–2010. In summary, the use of biologics as 1st-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis remained relatively constant at about 5%, but the durations of treatment with other pharmacotherapies before starting biologics shrank.</p>

<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease in which chronic inflammation in the synovium causes pain, progressive destruction of the joints, and disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1745790413480520">1</xref></sup> Estimates of the prevalence of RA in the US adult population range from 0.6% to 1.1%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1745790413480520">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1745790413480520">3</xref></sup> The age of disease onset is typically in the fifth decade of life and both prevalence and incidence rates are 2- to 4-fold higher in women than in men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1745790413480520">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1745790413480520">5</xref></sup> The direct and indirect societal costs of RA in the United States are estimated to be $8.4 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively, in 2005 dollars, totalling $19.3 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1745790413480520">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used to control pain in early or mild disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1745790413480520">7</xref></sup> Low-dose corticosteroids, i.e., prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone usually administered orally, but occasionally via intra-articular, intramuscular, or intravenous routes, are used in short courses to reduce inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1745790413480520">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1745790413480520">8</xref></sup> Drugs that slow the progression of joint erosion are known as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The traditional DMARDs are synthetic chemicals—methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, and parenteral gold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1745790413480520">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1745790413480520">8</xref></sup> More recently, several biologic drugs have been approved for the treatment of RA, and they also have demonstrated disease-modifying abilities. The biologics are protein macromolecules that act at various points in the immune and inflammatory responses. They belong to several classes, most prominently the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antagonists. The TNF-α antagonists—adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab—produce their primary effect by blocking TNF from interacting with cell surface TNF receptors. There are several other classes of biologics. Anakinra and tocilizumab are inhibitors of the cytokines interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, respectively. Abatacept inhibits T-cell activation, while rituximab acts to reduce circulating CD20 + B-cells.</p>
<p>Guidelines in the United States recommend biologics as 2nd-line treatment, following traditional synthetic DMARDs, for established RA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1745790413480520">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1745790413480520">10</xref></sup> Biologics are also recommended as an option for 1st-line treatment of early RA in patients with high disease activity and features of poor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1745790413480520">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1745790413480520">10</xref></sup> Cross-sectional studies of US health insurance claims data in 2001–2004 indicated that 12%–14% of RA patients used biologics, predominantly TNF-α antagonists,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1745790413480520">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1745790413480520">12</xref></sup> but there is comparatively little information about how biologics are used to treat RA in the United States.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine patterns of biologic use by RA patients, in terms of: (1) time trends in the prevalence of biologics use; (2) biologic, synthetic DMARD, and symptom-modifying drug use by line of treatment of incident RA cases; and (3) the duration of treatment of incident RA cases with non-biologics (NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and synthetic DMARDs) before beginning a biologic.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1745790413480520"><title>Study design</title>
<p>This is a descriptive analysis of longitudinal data in the IMS LifeLink™ health plan claims database for years 2000–2010. IMS LifeLink™ is a database of fully adjudicated medical and pharmaceutical claims for over 70 million patients in 75 health plans across the United States. The database comprises linked data sets of patient demographics and eligibility information, diagnostic (ICD-9-CM) and procedural (CPT-4 and HCPCS) codes for each patient encounter, and retail and mail order prescription records containing the NDC code and the quantity of the medication dispensed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1745790413480520"><title>Study sample</title>
<p>Biologic utilization was determined for two patient samples: the prevalent sample, in which RA cases were identified for each calendar year from 2005 to 2010, and an incident sample, in which incident cases occurring between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2009, were followed longitudinally. For both samples, the date of the first occurrence of an RA diagnostic code was designated the index date. Prevalent RA cases were identified as of January 1 of each calendar year from 2005 to 2010. Incident RA cases had an index RA diagnosis between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2009.</p>
<p>RA cases were identified by an ICD-9 diagnostic code for RA (ICD-9 714, 714.0, 714.2, 714.4, 714.9). Prevalent RA cases were adults at least 18 years of age on January 1 of the measurement year, with continuous enrolment and no RA medical claim for the 6 months prior to the index date. Incident cases were adults at least 18 years of age on the index date, with continuous enrolment and no RA medical claims for 12 months prior to the index date. Both prevalent and incident cases were also required to have either an RA medical claim or a prescription for an RA medication (a corticosteroid, DMARD, or biologic, identified by NDC code as well as HCPCS and CPT<sup>®</sup> Drug and Product Codes) in the 12 months following the index date.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1745790413480520"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The proportions of RA prevalent cases using biologics were computed for each calendar year from 2005 to 2010 and projected onto the US population of RA patients. Drug category (NSAIDs/corticosteroids, synthetic DMARDs, biologics) use by incident RA cases was calculated by treatment line (1st through ≥5th line). The duration of treatment before commencing biologic drug therapy was computed for RA incident cases by 1st-line drug category (NSAIDs/corticosteroids, synthetic DMARDs, biologics).</p>
<p>Prevalent cases were analyzed for each calendar year from 2005 to 2010. Patient age was calculated from the patient’s date of birth. The presence of selected co-morbidities was based on pharmacy and/or medical claims in the period between the index date and the end of the measurement year(s). Pharmacy claims were used for medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and depression. Rates of use of biologics were projected from prevalent cases to the US population of adults with RA. This projection was based on sales of biologics in the United States, using data in the IMS MIDAS® drug sales database for 2005–2010. The projection was based on a four-step calculation as follows. In step 1, the average cost per patient of each biologic was determined for each year. The average cost per patient represented actual utilization taking into account medication adherence, persistency, and dose changes. In step 2, the number of patients in the United States taking each biologic was calculated by dividing the total US sales of each biologic by the average cost per patient determined in step 1. In step 3, the percent of patients using each biologic who had RA was calculated from the US prevalence of adult RA<sup>3</sup> and number of US patients taking each biologic calculated in step 2. Finally, in step 4, the numbers of US RA patients taking each biologic were summed to calculate their total biologic use.</p>
<p>Incident cases of RA were followed from the index date to either the end of the study period (December 31, 2010), disenrollment from the health plan, or death. The sequence of drug therapies following the index date was determined by drug category, i.e., NSAIDs/corticosteroids, synthetic DMARDs, and biologics. If patients used drugs from more than one category concomitantly, a hierarchical system of assignment was applied: if NSAIDs/corticosteroids and synthetic DMARDs were used concomitantly, the treatment was assigned to DMARDs; if biologics were used concomitantly with synthetic DMARDs and/or NSAIDs/corticosteroids, the treatment was assigned to biologics. In the first analysis, the percentage of patients on each category of RA drug was determined by line of therapy: 1st through ≥5th line. In the second analysis, the average duration of treatment with NSAIDs/corticosteroids and/or DMARDs before progressing to a biologic drug was determined. Kaplan-Meier survival plots with right censoring were conducted for time-to-event analyses, to estimate mean durations of biologic and non-biologic treatments. To examine time trends, this analysis was conducted for years 2000–2010, 2005–2007, and 2008–2010.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the prevalent RA population samples for years 2005–2010 are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1745790413480520">Table 1</xref>. Patient characteristics remained relatively constant during this time period. The proportion of female patients stayed with the range of 72.3%–72.7% and the mean age in the range 56.2–57.4 years. Comorbidities varied little, with the most frequent comorbidity, hypertension, remaining in the range of 34.7%–38.5% of patients. The patient N increased from 16,093 in 2005 to 76,049 in 2010 and the geographic distribution of patients varied, reflecting changes in the health plan composition of the IMS LifeLink™ database.

<p>The percentage of incident RA cases using biologics as 1st-line therapy was 5.4% in 2000–2010 and remained constant at 5.4% in the periods 2005–2007 and 2008–2010. However, the durations of pharmacotherapy before initiating biologics as ≥2nd-line treatment decreased during the decade. Hence, in the period 2008–2010, patients who initiated pharmacotherapy with an NSAID/corticosteroid spent a total of only 4.2 years on pharmacotherapies (2.2 years on NSAIDs/corticosteroids, 2.0 years on synthetic DMARDs) before initiating biologics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1745790413480520">Figure 4</xref>, lower panel), and those who initiated with a synthetic DMARD spent only 2.4 years before initiating a biologic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1745790413480520">Figure 4</xref>, lower panel). This is compared to 7.2 years for those who started on NSAIDs/corticosteroids and 3.7 years for those who started on synthetic DMARDs, before receiving a biologic in the 2005–2007 timeframe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1745790413480520">Figure 4</xref>, middle panel).</p>

<p>The data in IMS LifeLink™ indicate that an increasing number of prevalent RA cases received biologics during the study period, from less than 20% in 2000 to over 25% in 2010. This is consistent with a time trend of gradually increasing biologic use in the decade since year 2000. Cross-sectional studies reporting biologic drug use in the earlier part of the decade are consistent with this time trend. In studies of MarketScan administrative data for 2001–2004 and a state Medicaid program (West Virginia) for 2003, biologics were used to treat, respectively, 14.8% (TNF-α antagonists, 13.5%; other biologics, 1.3%) and 12% of RA patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1745790413480520">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1745790413480520">12</xref></sup> These two studies reported data for 7965 and 1157 RA patients, respectively. In two smaller studies of about 300–330 RA patients in the United States, the percentages treated with biologics were 28.8% in 2006 and 33% in 2005–2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1745790413480520">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1745790413480520">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, the percentage of patients treated with biologics as 1st-line treatment was 5.4%. This percentage remained constant in the periods 2000–2010, 2005–2007, and 2008–2010, suggesting a consistency of use for a select subset of RA patients. This is likely in accord with US guidelines recommending biologics as 1st-line treatment only for the minority of early RA patients with high disease activity and features of poor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1745790413480520">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1745790413480520">10</xref></sup> Consistent with biologics use as ≥2nd-line therapy, cross-sectional studies of patients initiating TNF-α antagonists during 2000–2006 showed that virtually all patients had previously taken other drug categories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1745790413480520">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1745790413480520">16</xref></sup> In a private health insurance claims database analysis of RA patients initiating TNF-α antagonists, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, methotrexate, and other synthetic DMARDs had been used by 49%–60%, 45%–53%, 44%–52%, and 29%–41% of patients, respectively, in the prior 3 months (the ranges depending on the specific TNF-α antagonist—etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1745790413480520">16</xref></sup> And in the CORRONA registry, two thirds (67.8%) of RA patients initiating a TNF-α antagonist had previously received methotrexate and one third (36.9%) had received prednisone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1745790413480520">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present longitudinal study shows that the duration of treatment with other pharmacotherapies before initiating biologics decreased sharply during the decade 2000–2010. In 2008–2010, RA patients spent an average of 2.2 years on NSAIDs/steroids and 2.0–2.4 years on synthetic DMARDs before initiating biologics, values about half the average for the decade 2000–2010. The data also suggest that patients spent less time on NSAIDs/steroids prior to initiating a synthetic DMARD, which is consistent with American College of Rheumatology guidelines recommending treatment with DMARDs soon after diagnosis.</p>
<p>Analyses of administrative health claims data sets have inherent limitations. Administrative claims databases do not include the detailed clinical information that would explain treatment decisions. Patients in the LifeLink™ Health Plan Claims Database are generally demographically representative of the national, commercially insured population, but the database does not include Medicare or Medicaid patients (other than Medicare Risk plans) and is not necessarily socioeconomically or geographically reflective of the US population of RA patients. Furthermore, the diagnosis of RA is often difficult and may take time to fully confirm. However, a Veterans Affairs study has demonstrated that ICD-9 and pharmacy codes can be reliably used to diagnose RA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1745790413480520">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the use of biologics to treat established RA increased during 2000–2010. Use of biologics as 1st-line treatment remained relatively constant at about 5%, in accord with treatment guidelines, but the durations of treatment with NSAIDs/corticosteroids or conventional DMARDs prior to starting biologics decreased.</p>
