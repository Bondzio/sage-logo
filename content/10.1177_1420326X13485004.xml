<sec id="sec1-1420326X13485004"><title>The Present Operation of IBE</title>
<p>I begin this editorial by introducing to you a talented young lady whom I met when I was attending the “Healthy Buildings 2012” conference held on July 8–12, 2012, in Brisbane, Australia. I was impressed by her quiet confidence and her intellectual assertiveness. She speaks good Cantonese and has a good command of English language. I attended her presentation of her paper on “Simulation based validation of two CO<sub>2</sub>-based demand controlled ventilation control logic for multiple-zone VAV system” and was impressed by her knowledge and command of her subject.</p>
<p>The reason I am introducing her to you in this editorial is that she has been appointed as the Deputy Editor to assist me with the editing of papers for journal publication. Her name is Dr Josephine Lau. She is an Assistant Professor at the Charles W Durham School of Architectural Engineering and Construction, University of Nebraska-Lincoln of the USA. She, like me, was originally from Hong Kong. She was a first class honours graduate and a Master (with distinction) of Building Services Engineering from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University before she went to the USA where she obtained a further Master degree in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University and a Doctorate degree in Architectural Engineering from Pennsylvania State University where she was also a graduate teaching assistant. She had won many awards for her thesis dissertations in America and for being an outstanding student when she was in Hong Kong. At a relatively young age, she has already established herself internationally. She is a technical committee member of the Environmental Health Committee of ASHRAE and she is an Associate Editor of the <italic>Journal of Architectural Engineering</italic>. She has published widely and internationally on a wide variety of subjects on Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) air cleaners, ventilation, floor supply displacement ventilation, HVAC systems, CFD simulation of temperature and airflow in multi-zones environments, energy efficiency and indoor air quality, in various journals and conference proceedings. I believe her expertise covers about 75% of the subject areas of our journal which has made her an ideal candidate to be the deputy editor. About 90% of papers submitted to our journal are within the subject areas of her interest, knowledge and expertise.</p>
<p>I would also like to introduce to you Dr Zhishi Guo. He is from the US EPA Office of Research and Development, National Risk Management Laboratory, Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division (APPCD), Indoor Environment Management Branch (IEMB). He is retiring this year and he has agreed to join the editorial team of the journal as one of the deputy editors to help me with editing of papers. Zhishi does not really need introduction to many of you who know him as one of the leading experts in indoor source characterization of particulate matters, VOCs and SVOCs, modelling of VOC emissions in built environments and indoor air quality simulation. He was responsible for the US EPA simulation tool kit for indoor air quality and inhalation exposure (IAQX). He is also a technical committee member of the ASTM Committee D22 on Air Pollution and Subcommittee D22.05 on Indoor Air.</p>
<p>IBE is going from strength to strength. There were 35,712 downloads in 2012, which is a 22% increase from 2011. There were 245 submissions to the SAGETrack, a 33% increase of submission from the previous year of 2011; plus there were about 80 submissions for the CSHeB Special Issue publication in 2012. The rejection rate of the journal is now about 70%. The impact of the journal has been increasing dramatically and I believe we are making good progress delivering a quality journal for the academic research and development in our subject areas of the built environment. The journal website is frequently registering visits from more than 173 countries all over the world, particularly from USA (19%), UK (8%), India (7%), China and Hong Kong (6%), Malaysia (4%), Canada, Korea, Turkey and Australia.</p>
<p>The increase in popularity of the journal has therefore increased the work load for the editor. I therefore have decided to recruit help from Josephine and Zhishi. The editorial team is now composed of me, being the editor-in-chief, Josephine and Zhishi as the deputy editors and Yan Cheng (Associate Professor of the School of Human Settlements and Civil Engineering at Xi’an Jiaotong University, China) as the assistant editor. The production editor of the journal is Divya Munjal of SAGE India.</p>
<p>I believe many of you are now familiar with the operation of the journal. All manuscript submission should go via SAGETrack (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ibe">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ibe</ext-link>). The papers received will go to the administration center for processing by our Assistant Editor, Dr Yan Cheng, who will initially screen the papers for appropriateness and whether the papers are within scope and have the right scientific content and reasonable level of English technical writing. She will also do a research on the manuscript to see whether the paper has been published elsewhere or if it is a duplicate submission. We cannot accept papers that have already been published elsewhere and do not accept duplicate submissions. Yan will also allocate the paper to an Associate Editor (members of the editorial board) to start the peer review process. The Associate Editor (AE) oversees the peer review by inviting reviewers for the paper and the AE will review the comments received from the reviewers and make a recommendation (Acceptance, Minor Revision, Major Revision or Rejection) to the Editor. The recommended paper would go to the editing center and the editorial team of Chuck, Josephine and Zhishi will scrutinize the paper for style, scientific correctness and English language before the paper can be accepted for publication. The editor may in some instances overrule the recommendation given by the AE and reject or accept or to request further revision for the paper. All papers should be approved by the editor-in-chief (EiC) before this is accepted and forwarded to production. The papers authored or co-authored by the EiC will be approved by the appropriate Deputy Editor. The EiC or the deputy editors would not have access to the peer review system for their own submitted papers.</p>
<p>From 2014, we hope to expand the journal to 8 issues per year to reflect the increase in high quality submissions to the journal. This year, we are publishing a special issue on the state-of-the-art development in architectural engineering, social and healthy building environment for sustainable development in Korea. I have currently agreed a proposal to produce an annual special issue on developments in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan on healthy built environments and impacts on environmental health. I have also agreed an intention with the UK Indoor Environment Group (UKIEG) to publish a bi-annual special issue focusing on the low carbon housing developments and healthy buildings.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X13485004"><title>Indoor and Built Environment: A Short History</title>
<p>Recently I have been approached regarding the historical links the journal is purported to have with the tobacco industry. In 2005, the <italic>Lancet</italic> [1] published an article which details links between the contemporaneous Editorial Board, sponsoring society and the tobacco industry. Whilst there is evidence that those links did exist in the very early stages of the journal's development when it was titled <italic>Indoor Environment</italic> (1992--1996) as the journal of the learned society “Indoor Air International” (IAI), following 2003 when SAGE began publishing the journal any such links that may have existed have been severed and a new editorial board has been appointed. The journal has full editorial independence, but both SAGE and the Editorial Board feel able to state categorically that there are no such links between the present IBE and the tobacco industry, or any other industry. Please note that IAI was closed in 1994 and the subsequently formed society “International Society of the Built Environment” (ISBE) was also closed in 2002.</p>
<p>2013 is the 10th anniversary of the IBE journal published by SAGE.</p>
<p>The present IBE Editorial Board is composed of distinguished academics from a broad range of University institutions, as well as established building and environmental consultant companies and government and international agencies from across the globe. Our Editorial Board has representatives from Europe, North America, East Asia and Australasian countries, with affiliations such as: US EPA and US Green Building Council of the USA, NRC of Canada; BRE, IEH, CIBSE and Scottish Energy Centre of the UK; TNO of Netherlands, BAM, TUM and The Federal Environment Agency (AgBB) of Germany; SBI of Denmark, CSHeB of Korea, ISPRA of the European Commission and the UN Habitat Korean Coalition. We aim to continue to develop a diverse and internationally representative Editorial Board with a range of expertise within the Building and Environment disciplines. I have worked for over 20 years at the BRE in the UK. I became the Editor-in-Chief of the journal in 2009 and I also re-launched the previously defunct society that year, as the new International Society of the Built Environment (ISBE), which is a not for profit company (not associated with any industry) with the following missions:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Promote sustainable development of buildings</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide a forum for information transfer and education of architects, building technologists, environmental engineers, environmental health practitioners and environmental scientists</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Foster international collaboration in research and development, building and environmental design, government policy, regulation and guidelines</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Promote “Health &amp; Wellbeing” for built environments for all cultures and nationalities.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Since the journal joined SAGE in 2003 it has continued to evolve from a journal which focussed on indoor air pollution with a medical health perspective, to a journal with an increasing emphasis on the performance and functioning of different types and aspects of built environment and urban development, indoor environmental air quality and the health and wellbeing of those people living and working within those environments. Since 2009, when I took my position as Editor in Chief, peer review criteria has been set as follows:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The potential future applicability of the research paper for building design, urban planning, government regulations, standards and guidelines</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The potential impact of the paper in academic learning</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Relevance of the paper to the current interest in global development; e.g., sustainable development and environmental quality issues</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Quality, originality and scientific merit.</p></list-item>
</list>

<sec id="sec4-1420326X13485004"><title>Papers of the Year, 2012</title>
<p>An annual award of IBE papers of the year was started in 2011. The award has highlighted well-deserved papers published by IBE. This year the nomination of IBE Papers of the Year follows the same criteria that were set out in the last year award [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X13485004">2</xref>]. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X13485004">Table 1</xref> shows the nominations given by the editor and the editorial board members. Please note that I used my own discretion for the December issue papers as these papers would not have the same exposure as the other issue papers for readers’ download.
