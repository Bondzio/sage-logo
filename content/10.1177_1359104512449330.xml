<p>There is plenty to admire about <italic>The Bipolar Teen</italic> by David Miklowitz and Elizabeth George. The style of writing is approachable, not heavily laden with medical or psychiatric jargon and remains informative and practical throughout. I would even add ‘reassuring’ to this description as it constantly gives the message that there are skills and strategies which you can use to help your child with bipolar and, in addition, breaks these down for people at a variety of points during the course of dealing with a teenager who has bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The book is laid out in three sections, the first, ‘Understanding bipolar disorder’, describes the common onset and concerns that initially arise when a teenage begins having mood difficulties. Chapter 2 describes the mood symptoms of bipolar disorder in more detail but, in addition, makes them specific to adolescents, for example discussing the appearance of grandiosity that may be out of synch with school performance, unusual irritability that occurs alongside symptoms of mood disruption. This is particularly useful given that so many parents express difficulty in knowing which symptoms are beyond the normal spectrum of behaviour for moody adolescents.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 then focuses on outlining the DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder and explaining how to obtain a diagnosis, mentioning some useful information to assemble prior to appointments. The latter focuses on the US context but generally the ideas presented are of some interest to parents, wherever they are reading the book. The final chapter in this section of the book outlines what parents can expect now they have obtained a diagnosis of bipolar disorder for their child. Although much of this is obvious, there is definitely a normalising quality to mentioning these common difficulties and acknowledging the strain it can place on parental and sibling relationships.</p>
<p>The second part of the book covers ‘Treatment of bipolar disorder’ in adolescents. Chapter 5 is probably the weakest point in the book. When discussing the reasons people develop bipolar disorder it remains general to the point of becoming slightly unclear. A large emphasis is placed on stress as causing the disorder and the concept of ‘expressed emotion’ is referred to but not clarified particularly well. Chapter 6 returns to form, with emphatic support given to the role of medications in treating bipolar disorder with a complete absence of scaremongering. Alongside this, the chapter includes excellent tips to enhance medication success and clear information about the most common medications used for treatment. Another strength of this chapter is that presentation of information regarding side effects and dosing of medication, is separate from information and findings relating to efficacy.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 contains a good synopsis of the prominent psychotherapies on offer and highlights the utility of Miklowitz’s Family Focused Therapy (FFT) in particular. It is important to note that the guide to professional qualifications is US-specific and is not generalisable to the UK or other countries. Chapter 8 focuses on practical tips to solving compliance or ‘accordance’ difficulties with medications in teenagers while Chapter 9 elaborates further on FFT and the principles of applying it in challenging family contexts.</p>
<p>The concluding section of the book ‘Helping your teen stay well’ contains excellent tips for enhancing both parents’ and teen’s recognition of early warning signs and using this information to put mechanisms in place to prevent deterioration. The suggestions are accepting of the struggles adolescents are going through to achieve freedom and independence and therefore much more likely to be palatable to both parents and teens alike. A useful chapter deals with the stress of suicidality and outlines how to make contingency plans in a realistic and collaborative style and the final chapter makes some suggestions for dealing with the school context.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this book is an excellent first step for any parent facing diagnosis of their child with bipolar disorder. It provides a wealth of practical and relevant information about the disorder and most importantly for parents, does so in a ‘hands on’ way with plenty of suggestions for ways to make the journey with the disorder easier for all parties involved.</p>
