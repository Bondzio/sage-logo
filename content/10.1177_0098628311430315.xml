<abstract>
<p>Abnormal psychology instructors often use traditional and personal methods to educate students about and improve student attitudes toward mental illness and professional help-seeking. Data from abnormal psychology students (<italic>N</italic> = 190) were used to determine if and how students’ attitudes toward mental illness and professional help-seeking attitudes change over time. The study also examined whether stigma-related variables were influenced by student presentations about personal experiences with mental illness. With few exceptions, stigma-related variables did not change over time or in relation to student presentations. Implications for research and teaching to improve attitudes toward mental illness and professional help-seeking are discussed.</p>

<p>The stigma of mental illness encompasses negative stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination against individuals with mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628311430315">Goffman, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0098628311430315">Link &amp; Phelan, 2001</xref>) and discourages help-seeking for mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0098628311430315">Satcher, 2000</xref>). Abnormal psychology courses highlight the insidious effects of stigma and expose students to accurate information about mental illness. Some writers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628311430315">Curtin, Martz, Bazzini, &amp; Vicente, 2004</xref>) have noted the importance of examining if the content of abnormal psychology courses reduces mental illness stigma and improves attitudes toward seeking professional help among students. The purpose of this study was to examine the degree to which abnormal psychology students’ levels of mental illness stigma and help-seeking attitudes change over time and in response to student presentations about personal experiences with mental illness.</p>
<p>Abnormal psychology instructors use traditional and more personal teaching methods to educate students about mental illness. Traditional teaching methods emphasize intellectual learning and memorizing facts (e.g., instructor lecture, reading textbooks, hearing third-person accounts of mental illness). Personal teaching methods emphasize experiential learning and attaching personal meaning to the course content (e.g., reading first-person accounts of mental illness, listening to audio recordings of therapy sessions, experiencing disability or mental illness via simulations). Both traditional and personal teaching methods may affect attitudes toward mental illness. Some studies have found courses can improve attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628311430315">Costin &amp; Kerr, 1962</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628311430315">1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0098628311430315">Mino, Yasuda, Kanazawa, &amp; Inoue, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0098628311430315">Mino, Yasuda, Tsuda, &amp; Shimodera, 2001</xref>), but others suggest null (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0098628311430315">Graham, 1968</xref>) or adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0098628311430315">Sadow, Ryder, &amp; Webster, 2002</xref>). Several studies have explored the influence of particular personal teaching methods. Reading first-person accounts of mental illness increased student empathy toward mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628311430315">Banyard, 2000</xref>), and experiencing disability simulations increased student empathy and improved attitudes toward mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0098628311430315">Wurst &amp; Wolford, 1994</xref>). Experiential methods, such as listening to therapy sessions of suicidal patients, improved knowledge about suicide risk factors and dispelled myths about suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0098628311430315">Domino, 1980</xref>). Personal teaching methods were more effective than traditional methods at reducing preferred social distance from people with mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0098628311430315">Mann &amp; Himelein, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although personal methods may at times improve attitudes toward mental illness, a competing viewpoint suggests that personal methods might worsen attitudes toward mental illness. For example, attitudes toward schizophrenia actually worsened when undergraduate students used devices that simulated visual and auditory hallucinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628311430315">Brown, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0098628311430315">Yager (2007)</xref> also expressed concern that exposure to first-person accounts of mental illness may cause unintended, adverse consequences. For example, having students listen to their fellow students present about mental illnesses such as eating disorders may be contraindicated because such presentations may be biased, promote myths about eating disorders, and give the audience ideas about new ways to binge, purge, and restrict their eating.</p>
<sec id="section1-0098628311430315">
<title>Present Study</title>
<p>The first goal of this study was to explore how student attitudes regarding mental illness and professional help-seeking change over time in an abnormal psychology course. Second, we tested the effects of a personal teaching method—student presentations about firsthand experiences with mental illness—on mental illness stigma and attitudes toward seeking help. This teaching method was designed to educate students about mental health issues through contact with a classmate whose life has been directly affected by mental illness. Research suggests that this strategy of combining education and contact with someone of equal status often produces the most effective anti-stigma interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0098628311430315">Corrigan &amp; Penn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0098628311430315">Holzinger, Dietrich, Heitmann, &amp; Angermeyer, 2008</xref>). We hypothesized that students in classes who heard student presentations would report less mental illness stigma and have better attitudes toward seeking professional help than students in classes who did not hear student presentations.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0098628311430315">
<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were 190 students (33 men, 157 women) enrolled in undergraduate abnormal psychology courses at a large public university. Ages ranged from 18 to 59 (<italic>M</italic> = 23). The participants were recruited from five semester-long sections of abnormal psychology taught by four different instructors. Two sections featured firsthand student presentations (<italic>n</italic> = 59); the other three sections did not have presentations (<italic>n</italic> = 111). We excluded 20 participants who reported they had attended fewer than half (three) of the personal presentations in their class.</p>
<p>Students who gave informed consent completed the Time 1 Internet survey (<italic>n</italic> = 190) at the beginning of the semester, the Time 2 survey (<italic>n</italic> = 173) the week before the student presentations began, and the Time 3 survey (<italic>n</italic> = 162) after the presentations were completed. The second author and one other instructor each taught a course with student presentations. In these courses, students were allowed to choose one of two versions of an assignment: to write a paper analyzing a case or to propose a personal presentation about their own experience. Instructors screened these proposals and then scheduled them throughout the second half of the semester, so that they could fit with what was being covered in the class. Students were not required to present specific information about their experience. The 15-minute presentations focused on personal or family member struggles with schizophrenia, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder, delusional disorder, and alcohol dependence.</p>

<sec id="section4-0098628311430315">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>We assessed mental illness stigma with seven subscales (Treatability, Relationship Disruption, Hygiene, Visibility, Anxiety, Recovery, and Professional Efficacy) from the Mental Illness Stigma Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628311430315">Day, Edgren, &amp; Eshleman, 2007</xref>) and the social norm of having psychological problems (adapted from a similar item in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430315">Bayer &amp; Peay, 1997</xref>). We assessed attitudes toward seeking psychological help with the Stigma Scale for Receiving Psychological Help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0098628311430315">Komiya, Good, &amp; Sherrod, 2000</xref>), the Self-Stigma of Seeking Help scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0098628311430315">Vogel, Wade, &amp; Haake, 2006</xref>), the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628311430315">Fischer &amp; Farina, 1995</xref>), the social norm of seeking help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430315">Bayer &amp; Peay, 1997</xref>), the Intention of Seeking Counseling Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628311430315">Cash, Begley, McCown, &amp; Weise, 1975</xref>), and the Disclosure Expectations Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0098628311430315">Vogel &amp; Wester, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="section6-0098628311430315">
<title>Attitude Change Over Time in Abnormal Psychology</title>
<p>Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to test for patterns of linear change in mental illness stigma and help-seeking attitudes over time in the abnormal psychology course (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628311430315">Table 1</xref>
). Visibility of mental illness increased significantly over time. Although this result would be considered a sign of increased stigma by the scale developers, agreement with some subscale items may instead reflect students’ increased knowledge about mental illnesses (e.g., “It is easy for me to recognize the symptoms of mental illnesses”). Participants also experienced significantly decreased self-stigma for seeking professional help but a significantly decreased utility of self-disclosing psychological problems. Thus, participants became more accepting of themselves if they were to seek help even though they increasingly questioned the utility of doing so. Most results were nonsignificant, however. Although participants likely improved their knowledge of mental illness by taking the abnormal psychology class, it appears much easier to improve knowledge than to change attitudes.</p>

<title>Attitude Change With Student Presentations</title>
<p>We conducted a quasi-experiment to test the effects of student presentations. Before conducting the main analyses, we considered the possibility that effects of the class presentations were confounded with differences resulting from specific instructors. Univariate ANCOVAs determined that there were no significant differences in any of the Time 3 dependent variables among the four instructors above and beyond the effects of presentations.</p>
<p>We did not find statistically significant (α = .05) differences in attitudes after students heard the presentations. Trends suggested that participants viewing presentations found it less risky to self-disclose psychological problems and found mental illness less visible. The lowered visibility may reflect a trend toward improved attitudes, according to the scale developers, or perhaps less knowledge about mental illnesses.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0098628311430315">
<title>Implications for Teaching Methods</title>
<p>With few exceptions, the results suggested that attitudes and stigma-related beliefs do not change over time in abnormal psychology courses and do not change in relation to student presentations about personal or family struggles with mental illness. The few significant findings should be interpreted with caution because of the number of statistical tests conducted.</p>
<p>Although the current presentations did use equal status contact, which research generally has shown to improve attitudes, it seems possible that unscripted presentations may involve material that does not meet other conditions that tend to produce positive effects. The present results suggest that psychology instructors must consider their pedagogical goal in using personal teaching methods. If the goal is for students to gain a realistic understanding of the experience of having psychological problems, unscripted presentations may be a good option. If the goal is to improve attitudes and decrease obstacles toward help-seeking, a different pedagogical approach may be more effective.</p>
<p>It is possible that presentations would have a different effect if they are screened with an eye toward managing and framing the information presented. For example, some students in personal presentations describe negative experiences with mental health providers, negative side effects of medications, or their own belief that they needed to rely only on themselves to cope with symptoms. Although instructors would not want to stifle such voices by presenting a biased picture of students’ experiences, they must also weigh how such material is included in presentations, mindful of the potential for mixed or negative effects on attitudes and behavior.</p>
<p>Impressionistically, in the experience of the second author, who uses student presentations in her class, there are impacts of these presentations that the current study could not capture. For example, the student presenters have reported great personal impact, in terms of both gaining a deeper understanding of themselves or their family members and feeling that they have used painful experiences to give something useful to others. There is also the possibility that students hear presentations in a unique way based on their own experiences. For example, students sometimes connect with each other during the presentation and exchange contact information. Such individual interchanges could not be captured in the current study, which evaluated the aggregate impact of presentations.</p>
