<p>The human body is complex and intricate; in order for it to function optimally, every macro- and micronutrient is needed in the correct amounts. This issue focuses on micronutrients and what can happen when there is a deficiency or imbalance of micronutrients. The first article of the issue, by Dr McClain and associates, addresses zinc and liver disease. The authors discuss the metabolism of zinc as well as the manifestations and effects of zinc deficiency, including zinc’s role in hepatic encephalopathy. The article then highlights zinc metabolism and supplementation in several types of liver disease such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, Wilson disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The next micronutrient addressed in this series is selenium. Dr Hardy et al provide an overview of selenium requirements, functions, and its role in critical illness. The authors review studies in which selenium was supplemented as monotherapy or as an antioxidant cocktail to critically ill patients. Dr Skipper addresses hypophosphatemia as a complication of refeeding syndrome. The author describes refeeding syndrome and summarizes 27 case studies of refeeding syndrome as reported in the medical literature. Drs Sriram, Manzanares, and Joseph review the role of thiamine in their article. The authors give a historical report of thiamine deficiency followed by a summary of thiamine absorption and biochemical actions. They then review thiamine deficiency—risk factors, diagnosis, deficiency signs, and deficiency associated with specific conditions. The authors conclude with a brief section on the appropriate thiamine dosage for maintenance and treatment of deficiency. The Pivotal Paper by Suzie Ferrie evaluates the first case reports of thiamine deficiency in 3 patients receiving thiamine-free parenteral nutrition. Considering the recent parenteral micronutrient shortages, it is a reminder to us of the importance of micronutrients and the severity when they are not made available in some form. The final themed paper of this issue is the CAM Corner by Dr Mullin. In this issue, he addresses anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the role of iron, folate, and vitamin B12 in anemia and the likelihood and mechanisms of deficiency in individuals with IBD.</p>
<p>The remainder of the issue contains several additional articles addressing topics related to enteral nutrition access, complications, and formulas; supplementation of specific nutrients, including fish oil and essential amino acids; vitamin C and D insufficiency in specific conditions; programs for educating parents with children who have feeding difficulties; and book reviews.</p>
<p>The year 2011 was successful for <italic>Nutrition in Clinical Practice</italic> (<italic>NCP</italic>), with the greatest number of submitted manuscripts in its 26-year history as well as an expanded peer reviewer pool. You may have also noticed the new look to <italic>NCP</italic>. The cover and article format have been updated for 2012. We look forward to continued growth with <italic>NCP</italic> this coming year.</p>
