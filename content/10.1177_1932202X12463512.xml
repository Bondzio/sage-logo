<p>Emily Hailey and her fellow research team members Callahan, Azano, and Moon offered an empirical investigation of test speededness in this issue’s feature article, “An Evaluation of Test Speededness in a Third-Grade Gifted Assessment.” The distinction between tests of speededness and tests of power has been noted frequently in the context of IQ testing and gifted identification, but with this contribution, the authors extend the concept to classroom-based assessment.</p>
<p>Kevin Besnoy and his coauthors Dantzler and Siders contributed “Creating a Digital Ecosystem for the Gifted Education Classroom.” The authors explore the idea that a constellation of environmental features may interact to influence teachers’ decisions about whether and how they will utilize technology in the classroom.</p>
<p>Matthew McBee, Elizabeth Shaunessy, and Michael Matthews contributed “Policy Matters: An Analysis of District-Level Efforts to Increase the Identification of Underrepresented Learners.” In this article, we explored the impact of the adoption of a plan designed to recruit more African American and low-income students into gifted education programs. Although the design of the study was quasi experimental, the authors used propensity score matching to attempt to estimate the causal effect of the policy. We would like to point out that Jill Adelson served as the action editor for this submission and that the authors were not involved with the editorial or review process.</p>
<p>We again remind authors and readers of the forthcoming special theme issues that are in the planning stages. Special Issue topics will include: Common Core Standards and Student Assessment; Implications of the Achievement Gap for Advanced Academics; Increasing Achievement and Access to College for Special Populations; and Advanced Placement Programming. Please tell us in your cover letter if you wish your submission to be considered for one of these issues so we can communicate your intent to the appropriate guest editor.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this issue and will continue to submit your work to <italic>Journal of Advanced Academics</italic>.</p>
