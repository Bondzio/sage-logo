<abstract>
<p>Providing drug information has become one of the essential job functions of a community pharmacist. To ensure the availability of up-to-date information, pharmacists should have access to reliable drug information. The current study was an effort to explore the use of drug information resources at a community pharmacy in Penang Island, Malaysia. This study also explores nonprescription requests, with a special emphasis on pharmacists’ agreement to dispense medicines without a prescription. A cross-sectional study was performed among the community pharmacists practicing in 3 populous areas of Penang Island. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a 24-item questionnaire. The response rate was 67.3%. Online drug information, compared with other resources, was preferred by a majority of pharmacists (n = 19, 51.4%). Of the pharmacists, 28 (75.7%) mentioned that patients often make a nonprescription drug request for anti-inflammatory agents, painkillers, and medicines for cough and flu. In about 59.5% of the cases, pharmacists dispensed the requested medicine without question. Most of the pharmacists stated they have dispensed painkillers, creams and ointments, antifungals, body tonics, and inhalers without prescription.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The nonprescription sale of drugs is a major challenge around the globe. In recent years, the over-the-counter (OTC) sale of drugs has increased markedly and has emerged as a major economic market.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512462214">1</xref>
</sup> In the United States, the nonprescription sale of drugs in 2009 amounted to more than US$30 billion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512462214">2</xref>
</sup> In these circumstances, the community pharmacist plays a major role in ensuring the safe use of such drugs, and community pharmacists have become a vital source of drug information for consumers. The community pharmacist’s skills and knowledge about drugs are essential to ensure optimal safety in the use of medications.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512462214">3</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512462214">4</xref>
</sup> The developing roles of the community pharmacist have increased the need for up-to-date information to share with colleagues and to educate consumers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512462214">5</xref>
</sup> In their efforts to be current, pharmacists should have access to the different resources available in the medical literature: primary (original articles authored by researchers), secondary (eg, review articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and referenced articles), and tertiary (collections of primary and secondary resources such as textbooks, encyclopedia articles, guidebooks, and handbooks). In addition, they should also know which literature resource will best answer the drug information request. Therefore, it is essential for a community pharmacist to have the most current electronically available drug information resources. A Swiss study showed that national drug reference books were not up to date and that pharmacists were requesting information from pharmaceutical drug manufacturers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512462214">5</xref>
</sup> Similarly, in Hong Kong, lack of time and absence of drug information resources were the common challenges noticed to the drug information process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512462214">6</xref>
</sup> Moreover, with advances in technology, traditional resources such as textbooks<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512462214">7</xref>
</sup> are being replaced with recent electronic databases and software.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512462214">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512462214"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512462214">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>When looking at the issue of drug information in the context of the Malaysian community pharmacy in particular, the use of tertiary resources was reported by a majority of pharmacists.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512462214">11</xref>
</sup> However, much is still not known about OTC drug information activity. This study is another effort to explore the use of drug information resources and drug information activity at a community pharmacy in Penang Island, Malaysia. In addition, the study aims to explore nonprescription requests by patients, with a special emphasis on pharmacists’ agreement to dispense medicine without a prescription.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A cross-sectional study was performed among community pharmacists practicing in 3 populous areas of Penang Island. Penang is one of the thirteen states of Malaysia and comprises 2 parts, the Penang mainland and Penang Island.</p>
<sec id="section3-0092861512462214">
<title>Study Tool</title>
<p>The study tool comprised 3 sections. The content of the tool was adopted from previous research<sup>

</sup>
<sup>-</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861512462214">13</xref>
</sup> and modified as per local needs. Detailed information about the sections of the tool is as follows:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Section 1:</italic> Section 1 consisted of 9 items that focus on the demographic information associated with the community pharmacy or the pharmacist. Details are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512462214">Table 1</xref>.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Section 2:</italic> Section 2 comprised 8 items covering routine drug information and patient activity at community pharmacies: how many prescriptions are filled in daily practice, for how many patients counseling is performed, drug information resources that are available at the pharmacy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512462214">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Section 3:</italic> Section 3 comprised 4 main items. This section focused on nonprescription, OTC drug requests by patients. The first item inquired about routine nonprescription drug requests. A 2-item scale (yes-no response) was provided for the respondents’ convenience to disclose their responses. The second item was an open-ended question asking the pharmacists how they ensure the safe use of a nonprescription drug request (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512462214">Table 3</xref>). The third item inquired about commonly dispensed nonprescription drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861512462214">Figure 1</xref>). The last item aimed to explore the pharmacists’ views about which drugs could be prescribed without a prescription.</p>

<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>The sample for this study was calculated assuming a total of 200 pharmacies on Penang Island.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861512462214">14</xref>
</sup> The sample size for the study was calculated using the Raosoft online sample size calculator (http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html). The estimated sample size for this study was 54, with a confidence interval and response distribution of 95.0%. The 3 most populous areas on Penang Island were selected (George Town, Gelugor, and Bukit Jambul), and 55 pharmacies were approached for their participation in this study. Of these, 37 pharmacies showed a willingness to respond to our survey. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using the 24-item questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0092861512462214">
<title>Ethical Approval and Data Analysis</title>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the administration of the Island College of Technology, Balik Pulau, Penang Island. Furthermore, written informed consent was also obtained from the respondents who contributed to the study. Descriptive analysis was performed by calculating numbers and percentages. Data were coded using SPSS version 13 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-0092861512462214">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The response rate for this study was 67.3%. The majority of the community pharmacists were Chinese females aged 36 to 45 years. Almost 70.3% of the pharmacists disclosed that they were working as the chief pharmacist, and about 23 (62.2%) of them had job experience in community pharmacies for more than 20 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512462214">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>While inquiring about the patient activity on the pharmacy, it was seen that in most of the cases the patient load for an average pharmacy was 50 to 100 patients a day. Of the pharmacists, 17 (45.9%) disclosed that they were performing counseling for the consumers. Most of the pharmacists (23, 62.2%) conducted counseling for an average of 5 to 10 minutes. In terms of drug information activity, it was seen that 33 (89.2%) had access to the Internet, and most of them (19, 51.4%) were using online resources to fulfill a drug information request. However, the <italic>British National Formulary</italic> (BNF) and the <italic>Monthly Index of Medical Specialties</italic> (MIMS) were the commonly mentioned tertiary resources (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512462214">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In response to questions about medication request without a prescription, it was seen that nearly 28 (75.7%) of the pharmacists mentioned that patients often make a drug request without a prescription. The commonly requested medicines without a prescription are anti-inflammatory agents, painkillers, and medicines for cough and flu. In about 59.5% of the cases, pharmacists have straightaway dispensed the requested medicine. However, 8 (21.6%) of the pharmacists preferred to ask about signs and symptoms before dispensing the medicine. Most of the pharmacists agreed to dispense painkillers, creams and ointments, antifungals, body tonics, and inhalers without a prescription.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0092861512462214">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many consumers and patients visit community pharmacy to fill their prescriptions. Drug requests can be either prescribed or without prescription. However, in both cases one needs some information from the community pharmacist for the safe use of drugs. Not only the consumer but also health care professionals can benefit from drug information services provided OTC.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512462214">12</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092861512462214">15</xref>
</sup> To ensure availability of these services, up-to-date knowledge and access to reliable drug information resources are 2 vital elements. In general, pharmacists often use multiple drug information resources to fulfill a drug information request.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861512462214">13</xref>
</sup> However, online resources (19, 51.4%) were preferred over tertiary resources. These finding contradicts the previous finding<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512462214">11</xref>
</sup> that tertiary resources were used by the majority. In current practice, pharmacist reliability over electronic resources has increased greatly.<sup>

</sup>
<sup>-</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512462214">10</xref>
</sup> This change might be due to the availability of the Internet; 33 (89.2%) of the pharmacists had Internet access at their pharmacy. Another reason behind this change might be immediate access to the relevant information, that is, adverse effects and drug interactions, which have promoted the use of online resources.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512462214">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the case of antibiotics, 14 (37.8%) were willing to dispense them, keeping in view the patient condition. Almost the same behavior was seen for antihypertensive, antidepressant, and antianxiety agents. In the case of minor ailments such as headache and cough pharmacist recommendation for medicine to ease the symptoms is helpful, whereas for serious complications such as depression and hypertension expert consultation is superior to consultation with a pharmacist. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the regulatory authorities to ensure systems of checks and balances are in place in the community to promote the safe use of drugs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0092861512462214">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Community pharmacists in Penang prefer to use online resources over other available resources. There were frequent nonprescription requests for OTC painkillers. Furthermore, most of the pharmacists believed that there is no need for a prescription if the patient requests painkillers, antifungals, and body tonics.</p>
<sec id="section9-0092861512462214">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>A small sample size is one of the main limitations of this study. In addition, this study was conducted in only a single state. From a policy point of view, future studies should focus on conducting studies at the multistate level to illustrate the variation in drug information practices across Malaysia.<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0092861512462214"/>
