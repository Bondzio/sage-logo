<abstract>
<p>This article describes the synthesis of dispersions consisting of irradiated poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) micropowder in an ester oil (Synative ES TMP 05) and presents their results of the characterization in terms of stability and rheology.</p>
<p>The degree of PTFE micropowder in the dispersion was gradually increased from 10 wt% to 25 wt%. In addition, two additives based on phosphoric acid were used to study whether they are able to affect the properties of the dispersion with the lowest concentration of PTFE micropowder.</p>
<p>The amount of irradiated PTFE micropowder affects the stability against separation. The dispersion with the lowest concentration of PTFE micropowder (10 wt%) showed the highest stability due to the pronounced high fine fraction of PTFE particles (Ø: 0.2–0.5 µm). On the other hand, the PTFE/oil dispersions with higher concentrations own a distinctive amount of greater particles (Ø: 0.3–3.0 µm), suggesting a negative influence on the stability of the dispersions. Nevertheless, these dispersions can stabilize themselves by these structures.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1350650111429915" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Irradiation of commercially poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) represents the usual way to obtain PTFE micropowder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650111429915">1</xref></sup> Such an PTFE micropowder is commonly used as an additive in a wide variety of applications, for example, as an additive in lubricants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650111429915">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650111429915">3</xref></sup> The preparation of PTFE micropowder by irradiation involves the generation of functional groups (carbonyl fluoride and carboxylic acid) and peroxy radicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650111429915">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650111429915">8</xref></sup> These radicals are statistically formed in the PTFE grain. However, only a small radical concentration was kept in the decomposed PTFE grain after the irradiation. These radicals are necessary for the coupling reactions between PTFE primary particle surfaces and oils having single or multiple olefinic non-saturated groups. Radical concentration of &gt; 5 × 10<sup>17</sup> spin/g of PTFE has proved as sufficient for coupling reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650111429915">9</xref></sup> A new covalent bond arises, in which a permanent separation of charge between the non-polar PTFE particle surfaces and the olefinic non-saturated groups of the polar ester oil molecules exists and a fine dispersion of the PTFE articles in the oil is achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650111429915">10</xref></sup> In this manner, stable dispersions originate, in which this chemical compatibilization reaction between ester oil and PTFE micropowder prevents the phase separation between both components.</p>
<p>We have studied the effect of the amount of PTFE micropowder as well as the influence of additives on the rheological properties (structural changes, dispersion stability) of the resulting PTFE/oil dispersions. Our investigations can contribute to an enhanced comprehension for the relationship between the amount of PTFE micropowder and the degree of coupling to the ester oil molecules as well as the extent of resulting structure in the oil dispersion on their rheological behaviour.</p></sec>

<p>These coupling reactions are dependent on what extent the used dispersion technique favors the reaction between the radicals of the PTFE primary particles with the double bonds of the oil molecules. The accessibility of the radicals is the important pre-condition for such radical-induced coupling reactions. Satisfying results are obtained using temperatures higher than 100 °C, namely an appropriate shear strain using an Ultra-Turrax disperser (IKA, Germany) in the dispersion, and an adequate long dispersion period according to the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650111429915">10</xref></sup> The reaction pathway is schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111429915">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>An evaluation of the degree of coupling is possible if the intensities of the ester bands in the FTIR spectrum of all extracts (Nos 1–6) were determined and compared with each other. As expected, the differences are low between the dispersions, because the coupling degree primarily depends on the duration of preparation and the temperature that were kept constant in all cases. However, the additives in the dispersions No. 2 and No. 3 can influence this result disadvantageously and disturb the reaction between the radicals and the olefinic non-saturated groups of the oil, in which the hydrophobic chains of the additives insulated the PTFE grain. Both these dispersions show the lowest intensity of the absorption band at 1747 cm<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>By the use of the relative signal intensity per milligram sample of the dispersions, tracing of the radical concentration was possible by means of ESR spectroscopy before and after these coupling reactions. In the initial state, MP 1100 possesses a radical concentration of (746 mg/spin). After the coupling reaction, e.g. with 25 wt% MP 1100 in TMP 05, a strong drop of the radical concentration was observed (4 mg/spin).</p>
<p>The characterization of the separation stability as well as the rheological and tribological properties was directly performed in the PTFE/oil dispersions.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec17-1350650111429915"><title>Separation stability tests</title>
<p>The PTFE-containing dispersions were characterized in terms of stability, the effect of the PTFE concentration, and the structure of PTFE which has formed in the oil dispersions. The influence of the additives on the dispersion stability was studied as well.</p>
<p>The investigation was started at 2300 × <italic>g</italic> for 2 h. The separation behaviour of the dispersion No. 1 points out that the PTFE particle separates roughly at the same velocity. This dispersion has the lowest separation velocity as the result of the large amount of fine and well-distributed PTFE particles. Both dispersions, which contain additional additives, show the quickest separation. Their separation behaviour is typical for flocculated particle networks, i.e., the resistance against further compression increases with the degree of the separation. Although the differences are relatively low between the additives, the dispersion with Crafol AP-24 separates faster. This is caused by the forced separation of the fine fraction, which is not firmly bound on the particle network. This fine fraction is stronger in the dispersion containing the additive Crafol AP-63. The other dispersions, which have higher PTFE concentrations, are polydisperse and show a similar separation behaviour. According to their PTFE concentrations, the height of the sediment varies.</p>
<p>For conducting the investigation of the shear-dependent separation, the measurements were repeated at lower centrifugal acceleration and longer measuring time (at 328 × <italic>g</italic>, for 15 h). Only the dispersion No. 1 possesses a steady separation behaviour independent of the acceleration. The other dispersions show shear thinning behaviour, because the degree of separation decreases. At the dispersions with high PTFE concentrations, the separation of the fine fraction becomes higher with partly distinctive polydisperse separation character. The large fine fraction (0.2–0.5 µm) of 70% in the dispersion No. 1 might be responsible for the higher stability against separation in comparison to the other dispersions, in which particle dimensions in the range 0.3–3 µm were detected and roughly the same distribution was found. Only the dispersion No. 6 (25 wt% PTFE) owns higher coarse fraction. In both dispersions containing additives, particle distributions in the range 0.25–2.5 µm were proved. The dispersion with the additive Crafol AP-63 is shifted to smaller particle dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650111429915">Figure 4</xref>).

<p>Both additives increase the separation velocity clearly and change the separation behaviour of the PTFE/oil dispersion (No. 1) from a steady separation behaviour to flocculated particle networks. That means that a change of the kinetic of the sedimentation process occurred by a modification of the particle interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350650111429915">13</xref></sup> The kinetic of the separation shows a ranking order of the separation stability that is independent from the centrifugal acceleration.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec18-1350650111429915"><title>Rheological characterization</title>
<p>These PTFE-containing oil dispersions were followed by the DSO option in oscillating mode both as amplitude-sweep and as frequency-sweep at ϑ = 20 °C. In the DSO mode, a stress τ(<italic>t</italic>) is applied at the time (<italic>t</italic>) and the resulting strain <italic>γ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is measured. The structural properties of the dispersion were characterized into the dependence of the deformation (<italic>γ</italic>) (by means of amplitude-sweeps) and into the dependence of the angular frequency (<italic>ω</italic>) (using frequency-sweeps), as well. Detailed information is given in the following literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650111429915">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In particular, an influence on the long time stability of the dispersions is expected by the temperature gradient and the concentration of the micropowder. In addition, the effect of two of phosphoric acid-containing additives (Crafol AP-24, Crafol AP-63) on the rheological behaviour (elastic behaviour) of the dispersion, which characterizes the lowest PTFE amount, was additionally examined.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111429915">Figure 5</xref>, the storage modulus (<italic>G</italic>′) and the loss modulus (<italic>G</italic>″) are plotted versus the deformation.

<p>An increased amount of deformation energy was consumed to achieve the yield point during the shear process. This behaviour is typical of many dispersions and it is shown by the rise of the loss modulus (<italic>G</italic>″) near the cross-over points of the dispersions No. 5 and No. 6. However, the course of the loss modulus of such dispersions is different and does not directly depend on the PTFE amount applied, as shown by the dispersion No. 6, which was characterized by the longest LVE area. Thus, no direct influence of the amount of PTFE micropowder on the structural strength is visible since counter-moving processes superimpose this influence.</p>
<p>The curves of the PTFE/oil dispersions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111429915">Figure 5</xref> can be divided based on their curve course into three groups. The dispersions of the first group do not differ from the rheological behaviour of the ester oil. This group has a completely viscous behaviour and shows no yield point. The second group reflects the influence of the additives on rheological properties of dispersion No. 1, which undergoes a considerable increase in structural strength and exhibits a yield point. In the third group, the increasing influence of the PTFE concentration becomes clear in the dispersions, in which viscoelastic fractions was induced by the increased PTFE concentration in the dispersion. In addition, the 25-wt% dispersion (No. 6) showed a cross-over point at the lowest deformation and the highest amount for the deformation work that possibly represents the effect of the varying PTFE particle sizes, which had been identified in the separation tests.</p>
<p>The effect of Crafol AP-24 as an additive in the dispersion No. 1 clearly appears by the shift of the curve to higher shear strain values and a yield point is additionally visible. Although both additives possess a similar chemical structure, the extent of the impact on the rheological properties, e.g. the yield point, of the dispersion No. 1 is different, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111429915">Figure 5</xref>.</p>
<p>Another way to represent the properties of the PTFE/oil dispersions in the amplitude-sweep is by drawing the plot of the loss factor (tan <italic>δ</italic>) versus the deformation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650111429915">Figure 6</xref>. The loss factor is calculated as the quotient of the loss and the stored deformation energy and indicates the relationship between the viscous and the elastic parts of the viscoelastic deformation behaviour. The viscous part of the viscoelastic deformation predominates in the PTFE/oil dispersions No. 1, No. 3, and No. 4. Particularly, the PTFE/oil dispersions (No. 5 and No. 6) exhibit a pronounced elastic part at tan <italic>δ</italic> ∼ 0.1 that is independent from the deformation up to 0.06%.

<p>As already described, the influence of the additives on the viscoelastic behaviour of the PTFE/oil dispersion No. 1 is clearly observable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650111429915">Figure 6</xref>. The effect of the additive Crafol AP-24 is strong enough to induce an elastic part in the PTFE/oil dispersion No. 1.</p>
<p>The viscoelastic behaviour of No. 1 is characterized only by the viscous part, in contrast to the PTFE/oil dispersions No. 5 and No. 6, which displayed the highest concentration of PTFE micropowder. Here, the elastic part is more pronounced. This conclusion could be confirmed by frequency-sweeps, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111429915">Figure 7</xref>.
<fig id="fig7-1350650111429915" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Frequency-sweep (<italic>γ</italic>: 0.05% deformation) of PTFE/oil dispersions containing varying amounts of PTFE (No. 1, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650111429915-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The deformation value of <italic>γ</italic> = 0.05 was chosen from the evaluation of the amplitude-sweep. At this deformation, no irreversible deformation behaviour was observed. For the PTFE/oil dispersions No. 5 and No. 6, the absolute values of complex viscosity |<italic>η</italic>*| showed a linear slope as expected for systems with an elastic part. The high level of G′ at <italic>ω</italic> = 0.04 rad/s of these dispersions indicates the strength of the structure in rest (No. 5: <italic>G</italic>′ = 238 Pa and No. 6: <italic>G</italic>′ = 905 Pa). This means that both dispersions are stabilized by the formation of physical network structures. This behaviour is typical for stable dispersions, because a three-dimensional network was established by the effect of the intermolecular interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650111429915">16</xref></sup> On the other hand, the viscoelastic behaviour of the PTFE/oil dispersion No. 1 was similar to that of the neat ester oil and characterized only by the viscous part.</p></sec></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec19-1350650111429915" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article describes the preparation of PTFE/oil dispersions, which consists of an polar ester oil and PTFE micropowder (Zonyl® MP 1100) in varying amounts from 10 wt% to 25 wt%. Dispersions were prepared by the reaction between radicals of PTFE micropowder and the olefinic non-saturated groups of the ester oil to use them as additives in lubricants to enhance their lubricating properties, e.g. extreme pressure behaviour and wear resistance. The obtained PTFE/oil dispersions were investigated by rheological characterization and by the study of the stability against separation under enhanced centrifugal acceleration.</p>
<p>It was found that the quantity of PTFE micropowder affects the separation stability. The dispersion with the lowest concentration of PTFE micropowder (10 wt%) showed the highest stability against separation due to the pronounced high fine fraction of PTFE particles (0.2–0.5 µm) in this dispersion. However, this property causes no formation of any structures in the dispersion. Therefore, two additives on the base of phosphoric acid were used to study whether they are able to affect the properties of the PTFE/oil dispersion with only 10 wt% of PTFE micropowder (No. 1). Both additives increase the separation velocity clearly and change the separation behaviour of the PTFE/oil dispersion (No. 1) from a steady separation behaviour to flocculated particle networks. It means that a change of the kinetic of the sedimentation process occurred by a modification of the particle interactions. In addition, study of the influence of these additives on the viscoelastic behaviour of the PTFE/oil dispersion (No. 1) was followed by rheological investigations. The effect of the additive Crafol AP-24 is strong enough to induce an elastic part in the PTFE/oil dispersion No. 1.</p>
<p>In another article, the question shall be answered whether these structures are able to change the tribological properties of the PTFE/oil dispersions.</p></sec>
