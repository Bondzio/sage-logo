<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The effective communication of information on the self-management of diabetes to communities from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds is a complex task with many interrelating factors. In this instance, the term ‘CALD’ refers to people and groups from a variety of refugee and migrant backgrounds, including those more recently arrived to others who have been settled longer in Australia. CALD communities have ongoing needs for suitable chronic condition self-management information, both on first arrival and throughout their lives.</p>
<p>For many people in Australia, generic health campaigns in English and based on Western values and assumptions do not provide adequate information to support the self-management of chronic diseases, indicating the need for culturally tailored communication strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911407054">1</xref></sup>. For example, basic translation into community languages on paper-based resources often does not consider factors such as the importance of cultural context in relation to health messages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911407054">2</xref></sup>, literacy in the community language(s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911407054">3</xref></sup>, differing cultural attitudes to the management of health and wellbeing issues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911407054">4</xref></sup> and the need for peer-to-peer support networks within the community.</p>
<p>At the same time, recent advances in digital technology, such as more affordable digital imaging capability available on mobile phones and cameras, greater convergence of mobile devices and the internet and highly interactive online platforms, such as Twitter, YouTube, Blogs and other social networking media, indicate the potential for more nuanced, community-driven and culturally sensitive forms of health information that support the self-management of chronic diseases with people from refugee and migrant backgrounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911407054">5</xref></sup>. In addition, as health and wellbeing information is increasingly disseminated online or through other digital technology supported ways, those without the requisite quality and frequency of access to digital technology are at risk of being excluded from new and emerging modes of digital communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911407054">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911407054">7</xref></sup>, and this in turn can negatively impact on their ability to self-manage chronic diseases, such as diabetes. The problems associated with ill health and cultural and linguistic background can become exacerbated by poor and/or low engagement with digital technology.</p>
<p>The case study discussed in this paper sought to address these issues related to culturally appropriate information for chronic disease self-management and the use of digital technology with elderly members of the Vietnamese community. It was designed and developed in partnership with the Quang Minh Buddhist Temple in Melbourne’s west as part of the ‘Promoting Using ICT for Chronic Disease Self-Management by Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) Communities’ project which was funded by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing and led by Victoria University.</p>
<p>The case study was built around a framework that was developed for using digital technology to communicate chronic disease self-management with CALD communities. Communicating chronic disease self-management requires a consideration of and engagement with specific factors relating to language, literacy, cultural background, educational level and quality of access to technology. These factors were identified from the literature and consultations with health service providers and community organizations and used as the basis for the framework, which was tested during the case study.</p>
<p>The case study engaged the Vietnamese community in Melbourne’s west through consultations with the Quang Minh Buddhist Temple. The Quang Minh Buddhist Temple is a centre for the Vietnamese Buddhist community in Victoria and other Buddhist communities across the Victoria state, and aims to offer services that reflect the needs of the community, including the elderly, through its various community programs. The case study involved an interactive information session about diabetes, YouTube and digital video cameras for elderly women from the Vietnamese community. During the session, the presenter used a screen, data projector, laptop with mobile internet access and digital video cameras. The presenter introduced ways of using YouTube for health and wellbeing videos, screened diabetes-related video messages and provided tips on using digital video cameras. Participants then filmed each other talking about their experiences concerning food and diabetes with the digital video camera. A dietician from the local health centre attended and fielded questions from participants about food and diabetes. The framework was tested during this process of engagement with the community. Participant feedback, collected after the session, is analysed and provides important insight into the effectiveness of using digital technology for communicating chronic condition self-management with elderly members of the Vietnamese community. Finally, lessons from working with CALD communities are also outlined for future practice.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>A number of methods were used to conduct this case study. The literature review explored issues, debates and projects related to health promotion, chronic disease self-management – particularly type 2 diabetes – and digital technology. Consultations were held with CALD communities from the Western regions of Melbourne including representatives from community organizations and health service providers. A framework, based on key findings and recommendations from the literature review and consultations, was designed to address the needs of CALD community members to self-manage chronic conditions using innovative information and communication technology (ICT) strategies. The framework was tested with the help of the Quang Minh Buddhist Temple through consultations, workshops and an interactive information session about diabetes, YouTube and digital video cameras.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight elderly women from the Vietnamese community attended the session, which was presented in Vietnamese by a Quang Minh Buddhist Temple Community Development Coordinator. Participants were recruited from an existing community development program being held by the Australian Vietnamese Women’s Association. The Quang Minh Buddhist Temple obtained permission from the group to film the session, use the footage generated and collect feedback forms on the session. Feedback forms were translated verbally into Vietnamese for participants by the Community Development Coordinator. Feedback for the session was structured around four themes: awareness of diabetes information; the relationship between food and diabetes; awareness of how to use technology for diabetes information; and recommendation of the session to others. Descriptive and thematic analysis of the feedback was conducted to determine lessons for future practice. Twenty-seven feedback forms were collected from the 38 participants. In addition, informal notes and observational feedback was also incorporated.</p>

<title>Key issues and themes from the literature</title>
<p>The literature exploring chronic disease self-management, digital technology and CALD communities indicate the need for approaches that integrate culturally appropriate forms of health communication that embed digital technology within and across communities, health organizations and other key stakeholders. As part of this, a number of key factors must be considered: cultural and linguistic background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911407054">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911407054">9</xref></sup>; the need for self-management supporting strategies that enable self-efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911407054">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911407054"/>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911407054">12</xref></sup>; and the importance of interaction between various health organizations and other key stakeholders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911407054">13</xref></sup>. Digital technology is but one element of an integrated approach necessary for more effective communication of the self-management of chronic conditions to CALD communities. Creating spaces for communities, health workers and others to consider cultural attitudes to health communication and management is an essential part of this process, as is using digital technology to support patients becoming active agents rather than passive recipients in making decisions about their health and wellbeing and learning critical skills to manage their condition.</p>
<p>For effective self-management of chronic illness, the patient cannot be a passive recipient but has to adopt a proactive approach that includes interacting productively with the providers, the community and others in the network. Self-management support enabling self-efficacy for the patient is regarded as central to successful chronic disease self-management (CDSM) programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911407054">14</xref></sup>. Patients need to evolve in self-efficacy through health literacy, and it is vital they have the capacity to effectively participate in decision making. Peer-led self-empowerment training programs help to mitigate cultural barriers, while culturally tailored models of health care are integral to effective communication of self-management of chronic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911407054">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Digital technology makes possible the close partnership required between providers, the community and the patient for effective models of long-term care. Adaji et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911407054">15</xref></sup> found conclusive evidence that IT can be used to improve care by improving patient–provider interactions. Studies also point to the necessity of improved patient–provider communication through ICT-supported models of practice. Allen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911407054">16</xref></sup> advocate achieving this with the help of an internet-based coaching intervention through a nurse who becomes the E-coach to guide and empower patients in self-management strategies. The study by Bull et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911407054">17</xref></sup> suggests that the internet has not yet been harnessed effectively in CDSM programs, as the majority of websites provide information but few offer interactive assessment opportunities, social support, problem-solving assistance or evidence-based care. Jbilou et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911407054">18</xref></sup> argue for the combining of ICT utilization (ICTU) and organizational innovation (OI) to achieve better outcomes in health care. Gerber et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911407054">19</xref></sup> propose clinic-based multimedia sessions with patients using audio/video sequences, such as digital video, to provide information, psychological support and promote self-management behaviour.</p>
<p>Telecare and telehealth are modes of healthcare delivery that use advances in telecommunications, such as interactive telephone technology. Falsafi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911407054">20</xref></sup> argues that these models are important in chronic health management, as they facilitate collaboration among providers and also increase participation of patients in managing their illness. Telecare can also incorporate personalized monitoring plans through web portals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911407054">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Indeed, culturally specific healthcare models driven by technology may be the most effective option, overcoming many of the present barriers in health promotion, if the use and application of models incorporating cultural attitudes to health and nutrition, and concepts of management and prevention, lead to better awareness, interaction and responsibility for self-management. The internet and digital technology have the potential to be a powerful everyday link between the patient and others in the network – through web portals, networking sites, telecare, customized care, electronic monitoring and integrated medical practice.</p>
<p>These key themes and issues from the literature suggest that in order to empower patients to acquire self-management techniques, partnership between patients, healthcare workers and healthcare organizations is critical in order to develop and implement effective programs. Patients must be active and make decisions about their health and wellbeing and develop critical skills to learn how to manage their condition. In addition, a key component of effective self-management is a coordinated effort between various parties, such as patients, healthcare workers, healthcare organizations, nutritionists and dieticians and family members. Finally, customized healthcare models driven by technology may be a highly effective way to inform and empower individuals and their carers for effective self-management of chronic conditions.</p>

<title>Insight and learning from consultations with health service providers and community organizations</title>
<p>Health service providers and community organizations provided a number of insights concerning effective communication of information relating to CDSM, and the use and application of digital technology, based on their experiences working with CALD communities.</p>
<p>Language, translation, culturally appropriate information, knowledge of different cultures within health organizations and the need to develop trusting relationships between partners over time were all flagged as major challenges in supporting CALD communities within the current medical system in Australia.</p>
<p>Language is the most significant barrier for communities in seeking information and accessing health services. Face-to-face, interactive group sessions were widely acknowledged as most effective in communicating with CALD communities. In such sessions, use of preferred community language(s) helps to overcome linguistic barriers, the use of graphics and other visual aids through a variety of media cater to different levels of literacy and different cultural patterns of knowledge acquisition, and an informal setting and opportunity for interaction helps to overcome culturally ingrained inhibitions.</p>
<p>Using the services of people from the same racial, cultural and linguistic background – often widely respected members of the community – was highlighted as very effective, as comprehension will cease to be an issue and establishing relationships of trust is easier.</p>
<p>Acquiring information through various communication technologies is often preferred by younger and middle-aged people, while the elderly prefer traditional methods, such as radio and ethnic newspapers. Disadvantage to the elderly caused by this preference can be overcome by utilizing their preferred media to disseminate health information and through engaging the services of the younger generation in the community to educate and inform the older generation. In addition, consultations revealed that the elderly and the chronically ill are often isolated for a variety of reasons, including social isolation through language barriers and cultural attitudes and difficulties in physical movement either through disability or lack of transport.</p>
<p>Other key findings from consultations included the need for compulsory cultural awareness training for health and other service providers, and the lack of knowledge in communities about diseases and the health services available, which often hinder access to appropriate treatment and care options.</p>

<title>A framework for using digital technology to improve communication and outcomes for CALD communities: development and testing</title>
<sec id="section6-0017896911407054">
<title>Development of the framework</title>
<p>The findings from the literature review and consultations with health service providers and community organizations suggest a wide range of issues relating to health education using digital technology with CALD communities. These issues are complicated by the diversity between and within CALD communities on the basis of age, gender, culture, preferred language, educational background and English language proficiency. CALD community members will often have different perspectives on health. A ‘one size fits all’ approach to health management does not adequately address the issues facing CALD communities.</p>
<p>The use and application of digital technology is similarly different between and among CALD communities. Recently arrived CALD communities will often prioritize certain kinds of digital technology, such as mobile phones, over more expensive and less accessible forms of technology, such as broadband internet. CALD communities who have been settled longer in Australia may be better networked, have more access to economic resources and be more open to new and emerging kinds of digital technology. At the same time, in some CALD communities younger community members are more likely to understand and take advantage of the full functionality of more complex forms of digital technology. An older CALD community member may have access to the internet, but not be aware of the capacity of highly interactive social media platforms.</p>
<p>Given the diversity and often varying issues in CALD communities, strategies for support must fit the cultural context of the community. The findings from the literature review and consultations reflect the need for a number of general considerations that that are beneficial in supporting the delivery of health promotion and support strategies, including: greater flexibility in service delivery; improved understanding of cultural and lifestyle practices; use of bilingual educators and/or preferred language of CALD communities; consideration of fasting or lifestyles/religious rituals; cultural consideration of the role of family in disseminating information (e.g. eldest son may do a majority of translating, or information sharing); acknowledgement of often high levels of engagement by community members in healthcare decisions.</p>
<p>To address these issues for diabetes education supported by digital technology with CALD communities, four key steps were identified and tested in the case study with the Quang Minh Buddhist Temple and elderly women from the Vietnamese community. They are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0017896911407054">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Testing of the framework</title>
<p>The framework was applied to the health education activities of the Quang Minh Buddhist temple for the Vietnamese community in Melbourne’s west with the help of the Community Development Coordinator. This resulted in a number of challenges being identified about the community’s experiences and understanding of diabetes through consultations conducted as part of existing community development programs and projects. While it was acknowledged that many community members would benefit from improved information and digital technology supported approaches to self-management of diabetes, elderly women of the Vietnamese community were flagged as being a marginalized group, having limited access to digital technology and being in need of culturally appropriate information concerning the self-management of diabetes, particularly in relation to the consumption of food and how this impacts on the management of the disease. The problem of a lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate diabetes information was cited, as well as the need for more awareness of the needs of elderly Vietnamese women with local health organizations, such as health centres.</p>
<p>The specific cultural knowledge created through application of the framework informed a diabetes health promotion plan developed by the Quang Minh Buddhist Temple. The goal of this plan was to help address a gap in understanding around diabetes, food and digital technology within the group in the community. The plan identified an ‘interactive information session’, featuring the use of YouTube and digital video cameras, as a strategic ‘first step’ to using digital technology for diabetes more effectively, and in a culturally sensitive way that engages the community members.</p>
<p>Specific techniques from the framework were applied in the diabetes and digital technology information session. Language was addressed through the inclusion of a bilingual (Vietnamese and English) speaker and the use of visual/aural-based communication featuring video content in Vietnamese. A dietician from the local health centre participated to make the session interactive, provide information about food and diabetes in a face-to-face setting and to improve the links between the different organizations. Finally, a range of digital technology devices (laptop, mobile internet access, data projector, speakers, YouTube, digital video cameras) were used to reflect key strategies from the framework, such as the use of culturally appropriate audio visual resources for health communication and the integration of older forms of technology (audio video) with new and emerging technology, such as YouTube, video blogs and other social media. During the session, elderly members of the Vietnamese community not only learned about ways of using YouTube to find online diabetes information, but also generated their own health information by using digital video cameras to film each other talking about their experiences with the chronic disease.</p>

<sec id="section8-0017896911407054">
<title>Feedback and evaluation of the information session</title>
<p>The evaluation component of the case study, conducted with support from the Quang Minh Buddhist Temple, aimed to:</p>
<list id="list1-0017896911407054" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>gather feedback from participants on the information session;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>explore the experiences of elderly Vietnamese women during the session;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>explore what changes the elderly Vietnamese women experienced during the session; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>identify what works and what could be improved for future practice.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Anecdotal responses indicated that the information session was generally well received and was seen as a ‘fun’ event. Feedback forms were in English but translated verbally into Vietnamese by the facilitator as the group completed the questions, one by one. Terms used to rate responses were explained by the facilitator. On the day, some members of the group indicated that using ‘numbers’ to rate their feedback rather than ‘words’ could be a more effective technique for evaluation. Twenty-seven feedback forms were returned at the end of the session.</p>
<p>Questions included on the feedback form were as follows.</p>
<list id="list2-0017896911407054" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How well did this session increase your awareness of diabetes information?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How well did this session increase your awareness of the relationship between food and diabetes?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How well did this session increase your awareness of how to use technology for diabetes information?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Would you recommend this session to other people?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>While a relatively high number of participants attended the information session (38), 27 participants returned feedback forms. Therefore the following analysis of questions answered by participants does not represent the entire group. However, it does indicate significant patterns of feedback in relation to the use and application of digital technology and diabetes for the session.</p>
<sec id="section9-0017896911407054">
<title>Analysis of feedback</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>1. How well did this session increase your awareness of diabetes information?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A large number of participants (19) gave this question an ‘average’ score. A small number reported ‘well’ (6) and a few very well (2). This indicates that the majority of the group felt there was an average increase in the level of awareness of diabetes information. A smaller portion of participants responded more favourably.</p>
<p>The literature suggests that prevention education strategies need to be improved, and that patient education or training programs have been found to be effective in enhancing patient skills and confidence in self-management. This feedback suggests that the information session increased awareness of diabetes in a largely average way, but in some instances it was very effective. This indicates that the information session was able to improve education around diabetes information, and reinforces this approach as a viable diabetes information strategy, but with scope for further improvement and enhancement.</p>
<p>The consultations noted that face-to-face, interactive group sessions are widely acknowledged as most effective in communicating with CALD communities. In such sessions use of ethnic language overcomes linguistic barriers; use of graphics and other visual aids through a variety of media cater to different levels of literacy and different cultural patterns of knowledge acquisition; an informal setting and opportunity for interaction helps to overcome culturally ingrained inhibitions. In addition, using the services of people from the same racial, cultural and linguistic background – often widely respected members of the community – is found to be most effective as comprehension will cease to be an issue and establishing relationships of trust will become easier. The feedback from the group suggests that diabetes information awareness was increased and the factors relating to language, use of videos screened in a group session and facilitation by a respected member of the community from the same racial, cultural and linguistic background were important parts of the information session and significant in achieving this outcome. However, group participant feedback, due to its largely ‘average’ response rating, suggests that further improvement to this kind of information session can be made to enhance awareness of diabetes for participants.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>2. How well did this session increase your awareness of the relationship between food and diabetes?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Around one third of participants (13) rated the session as performing ‘well’ in increasing awareness of the relationship between food and diabetes. A small amount reported ‘very well’ (4). Others (7) gave this question an ‘average’ rating. These results suggest that the majority of participants felt the session increased the level of awareness of the relationship between diabetes and food in an average, well, and/or very well way. However, a small number (3) felt it did not do this well.</p>
<p>The literature indicates that culturally specific healthcare models driven by technology may be the most effective option to overcoming many of the present barriers in health promotion – models incorporating cultural attitudes to health and nutrition, and concepts of management and prevention lead to better awareness, interaction and responsibility for self-management. Feedback from participants at this information session indicates that the majority of participants increased their level of awareness of the relationship between food and diabetes. The information session, tailored specifically for elderly members of the Vietnamese community, and featuring an opportunity for participants to interact with a dietician, and each other, has been moderately successful in achieving its aim. However, the mixture of average, very well and well responses, and the small number of negative responses, indicates that the information session did help to overcome barriers in health promotion by being culturally sensitive, but again with room for enhancement due to the small number of negative responses and ‘average’ scores.</p>
<p>The consultations noted that the lack of knowledge in the communities about diseases and the health services available often hinder access to appropriate treatment and care options. The consultations also found that improvements can be made through compulsory cultural awareness training for health and other service providers, and that the current medical system is inadequate to meet the health needs of the migrant and refugee communities coming from different cultures and speaking different languages. The feedback suggests that the majority of participants improved awareness of diabetes in relation to food through an information session that addressed a lack of knowledge in elderly members of the Vietnamese community and communicated information in culturally sensitive ways, including preferred language – a gap that often exists in healthcare service provision for refugee and migrant communities. However, this needs to be further refined and enhanced in order to create higher quality awareness of this diabetes information for a greater range of participants during the session.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>3. How well did this session increase your awareness of how to use technology for diabetes information?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A small number of participants rated the increase of awareness of how to use technology for diabetes as ‘well’ (4) and ‘very well’ (4). Another (6) reported an average increase. This means that just under one quarter of the total participants responded with ‘average’, ‘well’ and/or ‘very well’ to this question. However, a small number (3) of participants noted ‘not well’. A further (9) were unsure. This indicates a mixed range of responses – while a number of participants benefited from the technology aspect of the session, a significant amount were unsure, and a very small number responded less positively.</p>
<p>The literature suggests that technology makes possible the close partnership required between providers, the community and the patient for effective models of long-term care. The internet and ICTs have the potential to be a powerful everyday link between the patient and others in the network – through web portals, networking sites, telecare, customized care, electronic monitoring and integrated medical practice. Technological innovation from an organizational perspective will also be effective in improving health service provision with CALD communities.</p>
<p>This session built on these findings and brought a relatively large number of elderly Vietnamese participants in contact with a community facilitator, a dietician and a university-based researcher. Using YouTube, including English-based diabetes videos, and Vietnamese video content, and also the Quang Minh Buddhist Temple website, the information session demonstrated how visual-based information could be sourced online and played in a communal setting to raise awareness around food and diabetes, and to encourage participants to seek out information using technology, and be proactive about obtaining health information. Importantly, the information session was ‘multi-modal’ in the sense that it used a data projector, screen, laptop and mobile internet connection – a key aspect of the framework, and also findings from the consultations relating to older and preferred methods of communication, and the use of visual aids. The consultations also found that acquiring information through various communication technologies is often preferred by younger and middle-aged people, while the elderly prefer traditional methods, such as radio and ethnic newspapers. Disadvantage to the elderly caused by this preference can be overcome by utilizing their preferred media to disseminate health information and through engaging the services of the younger generation in the community to educate and inform the older generation.</p>
<p>The information session ‘integrated’ newer forms of technology (internet, YouTube) with older forms of technology (audio, video, screen projection) to engage participants. It also aimed to be a ‘fun’ event, featuring a mixture of food, a chance to play with technology and to interact in person with a health professional. Research has found that a ‘specialist’ is regularly perceived by elderly members of CALD communities to be a trusted source of information, and having a dietician at the ICT workshop was a key approach to building awareness to the potential of online health information. Many participants had not accessed YouTube or considered interacting with health information in this way. Talking to participants in Vietnamese, and using a community-based facilitator, was also flagged as essential to boosting ICT capacity with this group, and was utilized during the session.</p>
<p>The mixed nature of responses to the information session for this question is important in relation to how effective the session was to raise awareness of using technology for diabetes. This suggests technology can be effective with members of this community, and the session improved capacity of the group to a limited degree; however, significant confusion persists and must be addressed in future information sessions. As identified by the consultations, there is a preference for older ICTs by older members of CALD communities. In addition, the literature supports a proactive approach to health and wellbeing information that includes interacting productively with the providers, the community and others in the network. Affordability and quality and frequency of access to digital technology, in this case broadband internet and YouTube, is another factor that may have resulted in the mixed responses, and suggests a low digital proficiency for the group. With regards to health information online, patients must evolve in self-efficacy through health literacy, and patient empowerment to effectively participate in the decision making is vital. Peer-led self-empowerment training programs help to mitigate cultural barriers. Addressing and implementing these factors in a more dedicated way, such as by involving leaders from the group and not just the overall community in the design, implementation and evaluation of the information session, may improve future ICT initiatives with this community group.</p>
<p>Supporting mechanisms, such as face-to-face contact, language and an interactive group session involving a respected member of the community from the same racial, cultural and linguistic background, were used to increase awareness and engagement with technology from this group. The technology was also made affordable through mobile internet access (provided by the university) and projected onto a communal screen at a face-to-face event. However, the feedback indicates a mixed response to the effectiveness of technology, and suggests closer attention to specific parts of the information session relating to digital proficiency, ICT preference and integrated, peer-led self-empowerment will help to facilitate better engagement with technology for diabetes information with members of this CALD community group.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>4. Would you recommend this session to other people?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A large number of people (21) reported they would recommend the session to others. A small number (3) noted ‘maybe’ while others ‘didn’t know’ (2).</p>
<p>A significant number of participants indicated they would recommend this session to others. This contrasts with the mixed responses from the previous question, and reinforces the generally positive feedback from the first two questions. It suggests that overall the session was effective despite the limitations identified regarding participants understanding and engagement with digital technology. In addition, it signals the importance of ‘word of mouth’ communication and peer-led techniques with CALD communities on diabetes and technology.</p>

<title>Key themes from analysis</title>
<p>Generally, the information session achieved its goal of raising awareness of ways to use and access diabetes information using digital technology. However, feedback from participants indicated areas for enhancement and improvement when conducting an information session, including more focused and targeted engagement with peer-led techniques, the digital proficiency of participants and ICT preferences based on age and cultural background. These suggestions for improvement must be taken in context, as the session was generally successful and many participants indicated informally and via feedback forms that the session was ‘fun’ and engaging. Key themes arising from this analysis of the feedback include the following.</p>
<list id="list3-0017896911407054" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The information session was able to improve education around diabetes information, and reinforces this approach as a viable diabetes information strategy, but with scope for further improvement and enhancement.</p></list-item>

<title>Conclusion and lessons for future practice</title>
<p>This case study has demonstrated the potential and challenges in using digital technology to improve awareness of diabetes information with CALD communities. The literature suggests that customized healthcare models driven by technology may be a highly effective way to inform and empower individuals and their carers for effective self-management of chronic conditions, particularly when based on self-management techniques and coordinated efforts between stakeholders.</p>
<p>Consultations with health service providers and community organizations found that language was a major challenge in communicating with CALD communities on health information, and that there is a need for face-to-face interaction supported by visual aids and other graphic information that addresses problems of literacy. In addition, using people in health service provision from the same racial, cultural and linguistic background as community members can be more effective when working with CALD communities, and a consideration of the different kinds of technologies that CALD communities use and access is necessary for health communication.</p>
<p>The framework, based on key findings from the literature and consultations, functioned as a useful platform to improve awareness within the community of chronic condition self-management through the design and implementation of a diabetes digital technology information session. It also provided practical and effective techniques for engaging a community in culturally appropriate ways using the internet, digital video and YouTube.</p>
<p>Evaluation of feedback from the information session found that while innovative in approach and increasing awareness of the ways in which digital technology can be used for diabetes information with the Vietnamese community, it also revealed there are continuing challenges in using digital technology to support chronic disease self-management. These challenges indicate the need for projects that have an acute understanding of a community’s cultural context and familiarity with different kinds of digital technologies, particularly new and emerging platforms, such as YouTube. Newer digital mediums require highly nuanced engagement strategies, particularly with hard-to-reach community members.</p>
<p>More broadly, this case study has found that a framework for using digital technology, using elderly members of the Vietnamese community as an example, can raise awareness and understanding of the self-management of diabetes with CALD communities. Challenges remain in using digital technology effectively, however, and reinforce the importance of a range of supporting mechanisms for communicating the self-management of chronic diseases in culturally sensitive ways.</p>
