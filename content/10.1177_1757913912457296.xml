<p>Firstly, we would like to share the exciting news that the impact factor for <italic>Perspectives in Public Health</italic> has risen from 0.833 in 2010 to 1.089 in 2011. This is a brilliant result for the journal, and a great landmark that we have stepped over the 1.000 hurdle. In addition the journal has now been ranked 76/131 in the Public, Environmental and Occupational Health category which means it has moved to the third quartile of this subject category. Many congratulations to the editorial team; it is a truly great achievement.</p>
<p>Speaking to a group of physiologists recently at their annual conference made me reflect on the rich tapestry of professions that we embrace under the umbrella of public health and indeed welcome as members of the Royal Society for Public Health. This multi-professional stage also allows for a unique opportunity to demonstrate joined up thinking and collaborative engagement. Public health provides a dynamic platform to approach a new way of working and has the potential to lead to a better more integrated society. For example the measures applied by local government to encourage people to walk or cycle could serve as an example of synergy between tourism development, destination improvement and public health; achieving a mutual goal of sustainable tourism development and healthier communities. Greater active participation in walking or cycling does not only improve physical and mental health (a public health goal) but also reduces carbon impact (a tourism development goal) and creates a more favourable image of the destination (a destination marketing goal).</p>
<p>The article by Yarlagadda <italic>et al</italic>. on page 207 makes a good point regarding the role of public health in climate change and sustainability as does Hanlon <italic>et al.’s</italic> paper on the future public health practitioner (p. 235). There is no doubt that a question mark sits over the sustainability of current practice within society and that the broad public health community has an important role to play in the emerging agenda of holistic life improvement. The new public health epidemics of obesity and loss of population wellbeing and the ever widening gap of health and social inequalities make our input of relevance to society. It is an intriguing suggestion of Blasio <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912457296">1</xref></sup> to develop a health filter to support local decision making and to some extent with the planned reallocation of health improvement functions and budgets to local authorities, dialogue and collaboration will be enabled in areas that historically have not been intuitively associated.</p>
<p>There is a centre stage for public health practitioners to work alongside other disciplines which illustrates the collaboration opportunities that are present. Promoting public health is a complex task but one than can be aided by other professionals. Opportunities are present to make, Vision, Voice and Practice, a reality and to impact improving social, economic, health, and environmental aspects of life. This issue presents some thought provoking articles which I hope that you will enjoy reading.</p>

<title>Weight gain associated with quitting smoking</title>

<p>According to a new study, giving up smoking is associated with an average weight gain of four to five kilograms.</p>
<p>It is well-known that quitting smoking can lead to weight gain but the findings from this study reveal figures that are higher than previously thought. Researchers studied the results of 62 studies to assess weight change after 12 months in those who had successfully quit smoking without the help of nicotine replacement therapy. The average weight gain was 1.1kg at one month, 2.3kg at two months and by 12 months, 4.7kg. This is higher than the total often quoted in smoking cessation leaflets.</p>
<p>However changes in body weight did vary widely, with around 16% of those analysed losing weight and 13% gaining more than 10kg in weight after 12 months.</p>
<p>The fact that giving up smoking could lead to weight gain deters some from quitting, particularly women. However the health benefits of giving up far outweigh this modest gain in body weight; a point made in the accompanying editorial to this study on the British Medical Journal website. Further research is needed to determine those most at risk of gaining weight and to find ways to prevent weight gain after quitting smoking.</p>
