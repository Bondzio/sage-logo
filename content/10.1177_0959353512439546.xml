<p>Power dynamics that permeate the structural relationships of social groups become embedded in the fabric of research; these inform assumptions that shape what comes to constitute knowledge through framing the questions and parameters under investigation. In the area of motherhood, ‘teen pregnancy’ is imperviously considered a site of personal and public health ‘risk’ and cause of negative outcome for mother, child and aggregated to society. By focusing on public discourse that constitutes and saturates thinking on ‘teenage pregnancy’, and a possible outcome on this, ‘abortion’, Macleod not only provides key insights and deconstructs what ideologies are maintaining and perpetuating inequality for young women, and intersections with women of indigenous ethnicities, but provides suggestions for a way forward, rhetorically, in relation to the provision of support at primary and tertiary levels.</p>
<p>Written over eight chapters, the first and the last provide useful summaries of the key ideas, concepts and theoretical orientation of the book, while the middle six chapters cohere around analytic themes, drawing upon, and deconstructing, various data sources: television, magazines, websites, sex education manuals, newspapers and empirical research findings. This canvases a range of subject areas in reproduction including sex education, abortion and motherhood. The location of the analysis in the context of history allows the structural origins of the discourses to be located, and intersections of ethnicity and social class to be foregrounded.</p>
<p>The first chapter sets the scene, utilizing a compelling case study to feed into the stated aims of the book: to examine the ‘research and social practices that allow for particular discursive constructions’, rather than the individual experiences of young women who become pregnant. Macleod introduces some of the dominant discourses of adolescence, followed by an outline of the social constructionist approach to the book, and geographic span of the arguments.</p>
<p>The second chapter traces the historical roots of discourses that pervade our current thinking on adolescence, mapping out the social and ideological conditions that have created a space for these understandings of youth and sexuality to occur. The developmental concept of ‘adolescence as transition’, when linked with the colonial assimilative concepts of ‘transition from primitiveness to civilization’, create a new discourse of adolescence that carries a ‘threat of degeneration’. This is further complicated by the construction of an ‘imaginary wall’ between adulthood and adolescence.</p>
<p>The third chapter builds on the previous chapter’s focus on the ‘adolescence as transition’ discourse, investigating how this sets up contradictions with regard to considering the teenager in relation to sex education, teenage pregnancy and decision making around abortion. Research on ‘teenage pregnancy’ goes under the microscope, wherein the lack of matched comparisons between older and younger mothers in various structural variables, sets up a false comparison that attributes negative outcomes to adolescence rather than the additional factors in question. Macleod then outlines the murky and entangled rhetorical terrain associated with the concept of adolescence and the capacity for informed consent and decision making in relation to abortion, and continuing with a pregnancy and parenting.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 picks up a further elaboration on the ‘constructing a threat of degeneration’ discourse in relation to teenage pregnancy. Macleod utilizes historical accounts and empirical research to illustrate the ideological shift in problematizing young women’s reproduction, from the stigma of ‘unwed mother’ to the age-focused, and to some extent racialised, ‘pregnant teen’ linking in with discourses about teenagers as ‘irresponsible’. Research findings that link ‘teen pregnancy’ and negative outcomes are challenged. Macleod also engages with revisionist arguments that suggest teenage pregnancy is a response to structural disadvantage, a lack of socioeconomic and occupational opportunities that renders no advantage to delaying pregnancy.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 takes a particular focus on young women and abortion, noting the simultaneous positioning of abortion and ‘teenage pregnancy’ within the ‘adolescence as threat of degeneration discourse’ rather than a solution to it. Macleod discusses the history of abortion legislation followed by an exploration of the methodological confounds inherent in research that links adolescent abortion with health and psychological impacts, grounded in the ‘adolescence as transition’ discourse. The concept of post-abortion syndrome is discussed, how individual difficulties become aggregated to constitute a ‘social problem’, of public and policy concern, subsequently leading to social denigration of young women seeking a termination.</p>
<p>In Chapter 6 the intersections of race, teenage pregnancy and abortion are considered, with a critical evaluation of the various theories and interpretations of existing research in this area. Current discourse, with colonial underpinnings locates black or indigenous ‘culture’ or ‘lack of culture’ (through assimilation) as a causal factor in high ‘teenage pregnancy’ rates. Revisionist arguments are re-engaged with to show ‘teenage pregnancy’ is not a ‘problem’ universalised across race. The socially located ‘other’ in culture, as primitive and child-like, aligns with youth, and femininity with the discourse of ‘adolescence as degeneration’.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 takes the ‘adolescence as transition’ discourse and examines the injunction of sex educators and public health systems to manage ‘risk’ around the sex and reproduction of young people. This discourse and notions of ‘risk’ come to imbue the current pedagogies and educational philosophies through a shift from overt to covert regulation, requiring the ‘expert’ educator to exercise subjective judgement on what constitutes adequate problem solving and decision making in relation to sexual intercourse and seeking abortion.</p>
<p>In the final chapter, Macleod summarizes the key points of the book, and makes suggestions for a way forward. In relation to research and service provision, a shift from researching the signifier ‘teenage pregnancy’ to ‘unwanted pregnancy’ across women of all ages is recommended. In relation to service provision, at a primary level, increasing accessibility and availability of contraceptive and family planning services is recommended, and acknowledging the social context of sex as a site of unequal power relations. In relation to tertiary prevention, Macleod advocates for abortion services to be free of psychological and social barriers and provision for services to reduce the social factors that make an unplanned pregnancy unwanted.</p>
<p>Macleod writes very accessibly, bringing the diverse set of literatures and expanse of evidence to helpful summaries at the end of each section and chapter, and distilling the analysis of the book within the final chapter. Reading the book as a whole often felt like there was a lot of repetition, as concepts were often introduced in prior chapters and considerably expanded in subsequent chapters, and oriented to the specific analytic claims; however, such links between chapters functioned to give good conceptual coherence, adding to the rigour and convincingness of the key arguments, and allowing each chapter to ‘stand alone’ in its own right. For researchers with specific interest in one subject area of reproduction, I would recommend reading beyond chapters of semantic interest, as key debates are dispersed throughout and chapters cohere around analytic arguments.</p>
<p>As part of the overall symphony of the book, there are strong fibres that connect the deconstruction of restrictive discourses with clear potential impacts and positive benefits for people. The mapping of social change with ideological shifts in history, such as the invention of the construct ‘teen pregnancy’, and providing suggestions for its refashioning, creates hopeful dialogue. Research such as Macleod’s allays any concerns that critical feminist scholarship is purely theoretical and not related to producing tangible benefits.</p>
<p>As an indigenous reader, further questions I have of Macleod in relation to the subject matter include: How do the debates around ‘parental consent’ harden us to possibilities of parental disclosure that may yield sources of family or cultural support post-abortion? How do culturally appropriate practices with respect to the abortive ‘tissue’ become instituted in the context of services oriented to white women? Are there unnecessary occlusions to this? How do indigenous understandings of spirituality that are non-synonymous with Christianity become complicated within the intersections of race, class and gender?</p>
<p>Drawing upon, and contributing to, diverse bodies of scholarship, this book would pique the interest of many different researchers. In addition to the recommended readership on the back of the book, Chapters 3 and 5 would be useful companions for health professionals in abortion services in attending to the broader debates around adolescence, pregnancy and abortion that their clients will be positioned within. Confounds identified by Macleod in these chapters present empirical research on negative impacts of ‘teenage pregnancy’ and abortion that would be useful to epidemiologists, statisticians and public health researchers. Chapter 6 is of relevance to indigenous and black feminist scholars, particularly in understanding the continued subordination of us as a people; how research can constitute knowledge in such a way that continually position us as ‘inferior’.</p></sec></sec>
