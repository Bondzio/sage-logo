<abstract>
<p>This study explores HIV risk in a small group of Black African women school teachers in South Africa. We used a two-part questionnaire with inductive thematic analysis to explore their private and personal sexual attitudes, as well as their perceptions of male attitudes about sexuality. Key themes are: a desire for power over personal choices, submission to male control in sexual relationships, HIV concern, and the high value these women place on sexual relationships. Although they understood the mechanisms for HIV transmission and enjoyed a degree of financial independence, some of their efforts to avoid HIV risk in sexual relationships, as well as their efforts to communicate about sexuality, were compromised by gendered power dynamics. The results from this study also highlight some gendered strategies they use to preserve their health and relationships. We conclude that an intersectional approach best addresses the problem of preventing HIV/AIDS within an inflexible post-colonial patriarchal structure.</p>

<body>
<p>On 21 March 2006, South Africa’s then Deputy President and the former president of South Africa’s National AIDS Council (SANAC), Jacob Zuma, faced allegations of raping a 31-year-old, HIV-positive woman. During cross-examination, Zuma pleaded not guilty maintaining that he was just acting as a Zulu man facing the dangerous nature of woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512439190">Waetjen and Maré, 2010</xref>). He did admit to having unprotected sex with the woman and also acknowledged to the court that he knew the woman was HIV-positive, but added that he took a shower following intercourse in order to minimize the risk of contracting the disease. Zuma was acquitted of rape, but his actions and statements have managed to endorse a dominant masculine Zulu male persona that undermines female security in South Africa. Despite the rape allegation and 16 counts of corruption charges, Zuma has a large following, which enabled him to secure the South African Presidency in April of 2009. His popularity as a ‘man of the people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512439190">Waetjen and Maré, 2010</xref>: 56) is based partially on his humble rural origins and his lack of education. Based on his presidential victory, Zuma’s influence over the nation is evident. Inevitably, his careless statements about HIV will impact the attitudes of some citizens with regard to this disease.</p>
<p>Zuma-style discourse about the nature of women perpetuates gender inequality and disregards women’s rights as they are outlined in South Africa’s constitution. In 1992 the formation of South Africa’s Women’s Charter Group was devised to ensure that women’s rights were included in South Africa’s new constitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959353512439190">Palmary, 2006</xref>). The1996 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa’s Bill of Rights protects women from discrimination, includes provisions guaranteeing women the right their own decisions regarding reproductive health and function, grants freedom of expression and denounces gender-based hatred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959353512439190">Palmary, 2006</xref>). These rights and provisions were scorned when Zuma led his supporters (gathered outside the courthouse during his rape trial) in a song glorifying violence, called ‘Bring Me My Machine Gun’. Even women supporters wore pro-Zuma shirts and shouted, ‘Burn the bitch’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512439190">Waetjen and Maré, 2010</xref>: 60).</p>
<p>As evidenced by Zuma’s rape trial, the incivility and violence perpetrated by men against women is accepted in the current South African political and sociocultural context. The incivility discourages ongoing debate about gender roles, and it helps maintain the institution of the patriarchal household (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512439190">Waetjen and Maré, 2010</xref>). This ongoing trend weakens the remarkable strides made in advancing the rights of South African women during the democratization of the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353512439190">Geisler, 2004</xref>), in particular, those advancements that include the South African government’s National Gender Framework Policy on empowerment and gender equality. This policy is vitally important to South African women because the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS is 17 percent among women as compared to less than 5 percent among men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959353512439190">UNAIDS, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2008</xref>) and the main mode of transmission in Sub-Saharan Africa is across gender lines.</p>
<p>Research has identified interlinked political, economic and social vulnerabilities that have marginalized women in Africa and contributed to their vulnerability to HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959353512439190">Weiser et al., 2007</xref>). These vulnerabilities include insufficient education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959353512439190">Kalichman, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353512439190">World Bank, 2002</xref>), insufficient food supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959353512439190">Jewkes et al., 2003</xref>), and drug use and sexual violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353512439190">Ackermann and de Klerk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959353512439190">Dunkle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512439190">Office on the Status of Women, South African Office of the Presidency, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512439190">Sawyer-Kurian et al., 2009</xref>). Unfortunately, prevention efforts that target these specific vulnerabilities have had limited success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959353512439190">Ehrhard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353512439190">Glick and Sahn, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The current consensus is that new efforts are needed because multiple forms of gender inequality serve as vehicles by which HIV transmission persists, and that political, social and economic inequality is central to female HIV vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959353512439190">Ehrardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353512439190">Jewkes and Morrell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512439190">O’Manique and MacLean, 2010</xref>). Thus, increased documentation is needed to show where prevention efforts are still lacking in South Africa as well as how existing efforts can be better tailored to specific cultures and subcultures. For instance, South Africa’s National Gender Framework Policy declared a decade ago that the best means by which to curtail female vulnerability to this disease is to address power imbalances in male and female interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353512439190">Gupta, 2002</xref>). Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353512439190">Seidman (1993)</xref> argued that a powerful means for addressing the power imbalances in a post-apartheid state was to adopt policies that would help women achieve the kind of fiscal independence that would help attenuate their subservience to men. This kind of independence might have helped them to negotiate safe sex practices, thus reducing susceptibility to HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>In this analysis we use Jean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512439190">Baker Miller’s (1987[1976])</xref> theory about dominance and subordination to further clarify the dynamics involved in Black African women’s heightened HIV risks in South Africa. Although originally developed for western women in the zeitgeist of second-wave western feminism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512439190">MacLeod, 2008</xref>), Baker-Miller’s theory provides an eloquent description of how power differentials can distort relational connections and shape the discourse available to subordinate groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512439190">Baker-Miller (1987[1976])</xref> argued that dominant groups possess greater power to set cultural norms, and this power over norms limits freedom of expression and action for subordinate groups. Intentionally or not, the dominant group legitimizes inequity by incorporating it into the society’s guiding principles, which then requires subordinates to learn how to please the dominant group.</p>
<p>In time subordinate groups often find ways to indirectly defy the dominants. Even so, the subordinate outlook remains sullied by the ‘untruths’ that they eventually internalize about themselves from the dominant perspective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353512439190">Baker-Miller (1988)</xref> argues that true connection requires mutual ability to take actions that represent one’s own experience in a relationship. Without the ability to take action that represents one’s personal experience, the subordinate group develops restricted and distorted images of their relationship possibilities.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512439190">Baker-Miller’s (1987[1976])</xref> theory about dominance is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353512439190">Gupta’s (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959353512439190">Kalichman et al.’s (2005)</xref> assertions that studying gendered relational power dynamics is an essential route to understanding HIV risk for South African women. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353512439190">Gupta (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512439190">Bredström (2006)</xref> argue that HIV research must take an intersectional approach that can include other salient factors such as racialized gender, heteronormativity, class and ethnicity, to understand how each factor impacts and co-constructs the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353512439190">Collins, 1998</xref>) as they intersect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512439190">Bredström, 2006</xref>). These intersecting hegemonic discourses on race and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512439190">Mohanty, 1988</xref>) have the power to establish norms that both disempower subordinate groups and compromise the empathic capacity of dominant groups.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0959353512439190"><title>Purpose of the current research</title>
<p>Zuma’s statements and behavior personify an ongoing male incivility towards women. In addition to encouraging incivility, his denial of HIV risk disregards the current biological evidence about HIV transmission, establishing a radically dangerous political context for women such as our participants. We hoped our study would allow them to voice their lived experiences. Although prevention literature has gone beyond the focus on high-risk populations, such as substance abusers, prostitutes and women living in poverty, the recognition of gender inequality as a key component to HIV transmission requires further exploration.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353512439190">Seidman (1993)</xref> reviewed two decades of unrelenting struggle for gender equity in the nationalist movement in South Africa, and acknowledged that although national-level debate about the status of women had generated changes in public opinion, domestic patterns of gender subordination were less visible and perhaps more resistant to change. Analysis of these patterns would require exploration of gender roles at the level of individual households. More than a decade later we see little evidence of this kind of research. Thus, we center our inquiry on household-level gendered interactions that represent the unique viewpoint of educated, employed Black African women in South Africa in order to both explore gender on a domestic level and expand the inclusivity of HIV research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353512439190">Andersen, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The participants were 32 Black African women in South Africa (majority of whom were Zulu), who were teachers between the ages of 30 and 59 from two schools, a primary school (<italic>n</italic> = 19) and a secondary school (<italic>n</italic> = 13) located in townships outside Johannesburg. These teaching positions require a minimum of three years of education-focused training. As they were in paid employment, we assume that neither drug seeking nor financial dependence would be primary motivators for the sexual relationships in this research population.</p>
<p>The first author (DPM) is the daughter of a teacher and has accompanied her mother to funerals of friends and co-workers who died from ‘unknown’ causes (whispers indicated the cause was AIDS). This experience inspired her choice to investigate HIV risk in a sample of relatively educated Black women in South Africa. We expected that due to the educational level of our participants we would find that they had knowledge of how HIV/AIDS is transmitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353512439190">Haile et al., 2007</xref>), but we were primarily seeking current information about how they construct their relational systems. We were interested in how they communicated with their partners about sex and sexually transmitted infections, how they perceived the values and behaviors of their partners, and how they negotiated and compromised with their sexual partners. We wanted to explore how and why this knowledgeable group of South African women may remain vulnerable to HIV in spite of the public health information programs to which they have access.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0959353512439190"><title>Our approach</title>
<p>Our initial research questions were formulated after informal exploratory conversations on the general topic of HIV/AIDS with approximately 20 adult Black African women in South Africa encountered in makeshift hair braiding kiosks and taxis. These exploratory conversations were conducted by DPM, a 28-year-old Black African woman from South Africa, who as a member of the local community is more likely to be trusted and more likely to suspend judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353512439190">Andersen, 1993</xref>). These women were generally skeptical about the prospects of curbing the AIDS epidemic: the primary problems they identified were male ignorance about HIV/AIDS and the cultural norms that perpetuate male dominance and female subordination. In spite of their disapproval of such oppressive norms, they also felt obligated to abide by them. Their disclosures informed our process as we structured our focused research questions to explore relational dynamics that might be intertwined with these problems.</p>
<p>Our research design was informed by both topic and the cultural and research contexts. During the apartheid era, communication about sexuality was tightly controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353512439190">Posel, 2005</xref>), and this tradition continues today among Black African adults in South Africa, with sexual questioning of older adults by younger ones considered culturally inappropriate and disrespectful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959353512439190">Delius and Glaser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959353512439190">Russell, 2009</xref>). Because intimate questioning about sex posed by a younger Zulu woman to older adults in an interview context could be considered disrespectful, we chose to use a questionnaire format to explore personal sexual dynamics.</p>
<p>We used a 50-question two-part quantitative and qualitative questionnaire, written in English, based on concepts derived from both the second author’s (MPC) expertise in the psychology of gender and human sexuality, and from DPM’s intimate personal experience with South Africa. Specific items were generated initially by brainstorming about the range of information we would need in order to address our overall research questions. Team consultations that included a sociologist, along with our individual reflection and review of the literature, helped to refine the questions (Thomas, 2003).</p>
<p>The first part of the questionnaire explored personal attitudes about sex with questions that covered communication about sex, importance of sex, how needs and/or demands of partners were accommodated, expectations about partners, and current HIV awareness. The second part asked the women to report on their perception of men’s sexual attitudes using similar corresponding questions. The corresponding questions about men were included to explore their insights about male experience, and to identify contrasts between ideals and realities in their relationships. The questionnaire utilized a seven-point Likert scale with two anchor points ranging from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’ for each question. Analysis of the quantitative data was reported in a conference poster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959353512439190">Mashinini, 2009</xref>). Each question also included the following additional prompts to generate qualitative data: ‘Please explain your answer. How do you feel about this? How does it affect you?’ Responses to these questions are analyzed in this article.</p>
<p>The research was approved by the Human Subjects Research Review Committee, and the respective South African educational institutions. DPM contacted the principals of schools in the area to ask for permission to recruit participants through a brief presentation. Participants were recruited after a presentation introducing the researcher and research subject matter at a weekly staff meeting. We had a rare and brief window of opportunity to investigate the intimate relationships of this group because some of the teachers had agreed to participate using their hour break in their school day. Informed consent was provided, and DPM conducted each data collection in the school staff meeting rooms with a physical space between each participant. The study was explained to the participants as an attempt to explore South African women’s own attitudes about sex, their experiences in sexual relationships, and their perceptions of men’s attitudes on similar sexual issues. They were encouraged to respond using their language of preference and they were permitted to ask questions during the data collection. All participants chose to write responses in English, meaning no translation was required. None of the participants asked questions. All were eligible for a draw to win a $100 store gift certificate. Completed questionnaires were placed in a sealed box separate from the slips for the draw.</p>
<p>Data were analyzed initially by multiple readings of the responses by the two researchers to ensure immersion in the data. The emergent themes were determined in part by the design of the questionnaire, so in an effort to explore the data more thoroughly, we used a strategy recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959353512439190">Charmaz (2008)</xref>. Verb phrases were used on each line of data to translate the statements into richer, more meaningful themes. We asked ourselves, ‘What is happening [in this data set]?’ Ultimately we used an inductive, thematic analysis approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959353512439190">Boyatzis 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512439190">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>) to recognize patterns of meaning in the raw data and identify the key themes.</p>
<p>We kept notes in memo logs throughout data analysis, noting the observed themes, patterned responses and intersecting factors, such as myths, values, fears and assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512439190">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). After repeated readings, links between the data began to emerge. We compared each other’s thematic codes after completing our own independent analyses and it was evident that there was a high degree of agreement. Once discussion and collaboration on themes reached consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959353512439190">Boyatzis, 1998</xref>), we chose direct quotes from the women’s questionnaires to illustrate the themes. It was important to remain aware that even as we communicated their own words in an attempt to give voice to their lived perspectives, we risked speaking for these women as intellectuals in a way that could further silence them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353512439190">Andersen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959353512439190">Narismulu, 2003</xref>). We hope that by using ample direct quotes we have adequately represented their lived experiences.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0959353512439190" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>We identified three emergent themes from the qualitative data. The first of these prominent intersecting themes (valuing sexual relationships) revealed prevailing positive attitudes about sexual connection even though the fear of infidelity was also common. Statements revealed that sex was an important element in their choice to remain in relationships even when there was an increased risk for infection. Sex was described as an essentially joyful and natural part of their lives. The second key theme (gendered power and control) revealed that the women wanted power over their own life choices even while they often submitted to male power and domination. This struggle occurred in a context in which males were often able to control communication. The third key theme (HIV/AIDS concern) concerned a fear of HIV infection which was revealed in the context of disputes over condom use and concerns about the occurrence of unprotected sex.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0959353512439190"><title>Valuing sexual relationships</title>
<p>Our participants often spoke of sex in a celebratory way. They valued sexual interaction for pleasure, excitement and health. Although their behaviors were at times compliant, their attitudes about sex were proactive. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353512439190">Varga (1997)</xref> who concludes that South African women place a high emphasis on sex in evaluating the quality of a relationship, and with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959353512439190">McFadden (2003)</xref> who encourages African women to reclaim and embrace sexuality, pleasure, joy and self-love and draw on the power of erotic feelings. Most<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959353512439190">1</xref></sup> of the participants indicated that sexual activity was a very enjoyable, normal and important aspect of their lives. For instance our participants said ‘[Sex] is like medicine that can cure your soul (11).’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0959353512439190">2</xref></sup> ‘Sex is life (21).’ ‘It relieves stress (29, 18).’ ‘[My sexual needs in a relationship are] a thing to be treasured (20).’ And, ‘sex is about feeling; I enjoy it to the fullest (13).’</p>
<p>Most of the women wanted a sexual relationship, but often subscribed to dominant ideals of masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353512439190">Jewkes and Morrell, 2010</xref>) including a stereotype of a persistently powerful man with an uncontrollable sex drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959353512439190">Walker, 2005</xref>). Responses to the question, ‘Do Men enjoy sex?’ included, ‘More than anything (18),’ ‘[if they did not] they wouldn’t be cheating and having three different sexual partners on the side (25).’ ‘They enjoy it even with a person they don’t love (19).’ And, ‘they want to have sex anytime anywhere (22).’</p>
<p>A few women found that when men refused to have sex it meant they were having extramarital affairs. One said, ‘This is a painful situation because it shows that you are not the only partner. I once experienced this, when my man [arrived home from a trip] he told me not to expect sex because he was tired (22).’ She later discovered he had been with another woman. Their recognition that a sequence of male behaviors communicates infidelity illuminated the traditions that support sexual permissiveness in African men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353512439190">Jewkes and Morrell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959353512439190">Walker, 2005</xref>). One woman said, ‘[men] think it is their right to have more than one relationship … that makes them to be men enough (25).’</p>
<p>While many were concerned with their partner’s infidelity, many dreaded potential accusations of infidelity by their partners. These infidelity concerns were intertwined with other sexual topics. For instance, a few women assumed that if they refused to have sex they would be accused of infidelity. They said, ‘[To refuse sex] I have to use an excuse like “I’m not well” because refusing plainly will indicate I’m involved somewhere else (26).’ And, ‘If I refuse to engage in sex, he will look for the next body who will satisfy him (25).’</p>
<p>Further, accommodation to beliefs about the hypersexual male was evident when women said that men are afraid to appear sexually inadequate to women or to other men. One woman said, ‘They think that if they don’t assume the dominant role [in sex] they might lose you (7).’ Fear of relational loss seemed to motivate covert strategies for securing the relationship. They admitted, ‘we hide the truth, it saves the relationship (6).’ And, ‘If your partner is not doing well during sex, you feel afraid to tell him that the standard of performance is not good because you fear that you may lose him (13).’</p>
<p>Ideologies that equate manliness with forcefulness and multiple sexual partners were amplified at the turn of the 20th century and, although they are now contested in post-apartheid culture, they still persist among many men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959353512439190">Hunter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353512439190">Jewkes and Morrell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959353512439190">Walker, 2005</xref>). These male prerogatives, although incompatible with controlling an HIV epidemic, appeared to be accepted by some of the women as a condition for being in connection with men. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512439190">Baker-Miller (1987[1976])</xref>, these women appeared to be monitoring the expectations of a dominant group and adapting in a variety of ways to those expectations.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0959353512439190"><title>Gendered power and control</title>
<p>Most participants claimed they valued equality, but at the same time many accepted male entitlement to dominance in relationships. For instance, the same woman who asserted, ‘No one should dominate in the relationship’ also said, ‘In our culture we are taught that [the] man is the head of the household (24).’ Some women accepted this dominance. They said, ‘they are the heads according to the word of God … I must know my place (9).’ ‘Socially and biblically they must take the role of leadership (4).’ And, ‘Women should respect, cherish, and treat their husbands as kings (8).’</p>
<p>Some women seemed to accept subordination with a sense of helplessness about attaining equality if they wanted to maintain their sexual relationships. They said, ‘they expect us to be quiet (23);’ ‘it has not sunk in to men that we are all equal (26).’ ‘Always, they expect to be the only one who has a say in the house (11),’ ‘Men always want to play a dominant part in a relationship (22).’ ‘They believe sexual pleasure is for them only (19),’ and ‘They undermine women (19).’ Many women made contrasting statements such as, ‘We need to plan, discuss and enjoy equally (14).’ Black African women in South Africa have not been helpless and fearful victims of patriarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512439190">Mohanty, 1988</xref>), as evidenced by their history of reconstructing themselves and their society during the resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353512439190">Geisler, 2004</xref>). Many participants emphasized that men and women are equals, but they also echoed the struggle with male dominance. They said, ‘Men are chauvinistic (23).’ ‘My partner is in control … he does not hear the truth; only what he wants to hear (6).’ ‘I do talk to him but he just ignores me (13).’</p>
<p>However, a few reported mutual trust in their relationships, and one woman expressed hope for the ‘coming generation.’ She said, ‘Gradually, [the idea of equality between men and women] is starting to register. They realize that now (20).’ Our participants were able to envision the transformation of their gendered social status as evidenced by the value they placed on gender equity. Some women resisted male power and made attempts at self-protection when they chose to withhold some personal information from their partners, and also when they were willing to end hurtful relationships or remain single. Many women also indicated their incomes enabled some financial independence in the present and would support them if they lived alone. A couple of the women reported that they were receiving financial help from their partners, but none of them were entirely financially dependent. Some said, ‘Everything that I have [is] coming from my hand. [I am proud] of myself (12).’ Another woman stated, ‘It is advisable to all females to be financially independent (23, 20).’ A single woman said, ‘I don’t need anybody to support me (28),’ and one married woman said, ‘I am working for myself (14).’</p>
<p>Due to their financial resources and education, our participants were not as powerless as some of the women described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353512439190">Ackerman and deKlerk (2002)</xref>. Consistent with Mickelson et al. (2001), education seems to diminish some of the social stratification and also empowers these women to a degree. Although these women were educated into a traditionally female course of study under apartheid’s system of race and gender segregation, they are now part of a growing educated Black African female population in South Africa in which increased education intersects with gender as a factor that can affect quality of life (Mickelson et al., 2001).</p>
<p>Many believed they should have a right to assert themselves to meet their own needs in sexual relationships. However, they demonstrated a reluctance to exercise that right when that conviction intersected with cultural norms. The racialized gender ideal for ‘good’ Black African women in South Africa is to be naive, obedient and passive recipients of sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353512439190">Abdool Karim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353512439190">Jewkes and Morrell, 2010</xref>). A few women wrote that it is the man who should initiate sex, and not the woman. One woman said, ‘being married to a Zulu man [a] woman should not talk [about sex] or else she is doing it somewhere (27).’ And another said, ‘[talk of sexual experiences] “is taboo” for women (8).’</p>
<p>Some of our participants reported they had endured unwanted sex as a means for reducing the risk of partner infidelity or to maintain peace in the relationship. They said, ‘I hate the fact that I have to hold onto him by doing things I do not like (25).’ ‘Your mind is not there [during unwanted sex]. You just wait for the person to finish (27).’ ‘I take this as a contractual obligation but it disturbs me (26).’ One woman responded to the question; ‘I have sex when I don’t want to,’ by saying ‘Yes especially when I’m angry … he enjoys it … it feels bad (3).’</p>
<p>While some of our participants reported they had had unwanted sex, rape was not a prominent theme. One said, ‘[I have not been forced] … Not even on a single day (10).’ Only four women reported experiencing forced sex, and only two of them suggested it was rape. One said, ‘It was an unpleasant encounter … I felt like it was as good as rape (6).’ The other woman said ‘I have been in that situation … you cannot enjoy [sex] if you are forced. It is a rape in one word (9).’</p>
<p>The gendered power theme was echoed again as they reported their struggles with communication about sexuality. A few women reported being able to communicate with sexual partners. They said, ‘talking about sex with a partner is good and it helps you to enjoy each other (27).’ ‘You don’t just say no. You discuss it (1).’ Our participants desired communication with partners, and one said, ‘Openness is the foundation of the house of love (23).’ However, some of their statements indicated their dialogue with sexual partners was limited. When asked if they are free to vocalize sexual preferences, one woman wrote, ‘90% [of women] are not free (27).’ Others wrote that women are not free to be vocal because they can be labeled as ‘whores (10, 26).’</p>
<p>One woman believed couples should be able to talk openly to each other but do not because it ‘might be detrimental since the men were uncomfortable with “such talk” (8).’ Other women said, ‘when we talk he [feels] embarrassed (13),’ ‘Men feel talking about sex with women will make them to be undermined by women (19),’ and, ‘[men] fear the unknown; that you’ll judge or see him as not knowing (17).’ The choice to protect the male from this perceived fear maintains relational stability, and, paradoxically, preserves the gendered power structure.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512439190">Baker-Miller (1987[1976])</xref> described power dynamics as a mutually constructed and active matrix in which dominance and subordination are dependent on each other as factors that impact behavior. Members of subordinate groups silence themselves in order to maintain necessary connections with the dominant group, and they receive some valued benefit from the connection. Our participants were not vulnerable simply because their male partners dominated them. The valued sexual relationship was clearly more salient for them at times than a high level of autonomy. In addition, their choices to remain silent may reflect an intersection of salience of sexuality and socialization in collectivistic traditions that emphasize duty on the part of a virtuous woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959353512439190">Ogundipe-Leslie, 1994</xref>). Or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512439190">MacLeod (2008)</xref> suggests, their choices may also reflect a desire to protect their relationships as a source of solidarity in the context of unsettling political transformation.</p>
<p>Historically, the intersection of both traditional Black African male and female roles in South Africa and the silences about sexuality fostered during apartheid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959353512439190">Morrell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353512439190">Posel, 2005</xref>) mutually constructed each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353512439190">Collins, 1998</xref>), and generated a power matrix that still restricts constructive dialogue by silencing open communication. This can be seen in our participants’ reluctance to openly speak their truths and in the way their submission to dominance co-creates a continuation of dominance. Many of the women expressed comfort in talking about sex if they could do so in friendship networks, and one reported feeling comfortable ‘only with my age group (4).’ A few were quite reluctant: ‘Sex is not something you talk about anywhere, anyhow (13),’ ‘This is a bedroom issue (6),’ ‘It is an embarrassing thing to talk about (12).’ Only one (21) wrote, ‘talking about sex is educative. As an educator I need to inform my learners to the level of their age.’</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0959353512439190"><title>HIV/AIDS concern</title>
<p>Fear-based patterns contrasting with strategies for resistance to power emerged again in responses to questions regarding HIV/AIDS. Some women said talking about sex is a necessary means for prevention. However, male awareness of HIV/AIDS appeared to vary with cultural background. One said, ‘civilized men understand all about HIV/AIDS (14),’ but another wrote, ‘Some of these men still believe HIV is the result of witchcraft (28).’ A woman, who felt moderately comfortable but ‘shy’ talking about HIV, wrote on the corresponding question about male attitudes, ‘Men think such talk is for women (20).’ The accounts of male reactivity to HIV/AIDS discussions were, ‘They believe HIV is carried by women only (9),’ ‘Men talk about AIDS as if it belongs to other people (6).’ That same woman states that, ‘to survive certain death, we need to protect ourselves (6).’ One said, ‘Men do not want to talk about [HIV/AIDS] (23).’ Another commented, ‘It is the woman who will bring up the topic. Then they [men] will follow (27).’ These data suggest Black African men in South Africa resist discussing unsettling or unacceptable information and depend on women to manage prevention efforts.</p>
<p>These women verbalized a clear understanding about both HIV transmission through body fluids and the means for protecting themselves. They also said, ‘Today’s life is very short and you have to take care of yourself. [HIV] it [is] there and is killing; be careful (18).’ ‘It is in us … we move with it, sleep, eat, speak with it, … We need to talk about it (9).’ Even in the face of their subordinate status some of the women initiated actions that protected their self-interests. For example, ‘In times like these I think even in committed relationships we have to use condoms because our partners are not honest (22).’ ‘I always talk about HIV/AIDS. I told him that I am, or he found me, HIV negative and I also found him HIV negative, so I want to stay HIV negative forever. I told him if that he starts cheating on me he should let me know so that I can leave him with peace.’</p>
<p>Most women believed they should use condoms even though some of them are not using them. They all wanted to protect themselves from HIV, and some did not trust their partners to be honest about infidelity. However, there was general agreement that men do not like using condoms. Some women stated that men think condoms are for the unmarried. ‘They believe in flesh to flesh (19).’ and ‘[Men] think condom sex is like eating a wrapped sweet (20).’ And one woman said, ‘[Men] like taking chances with their lives (28).’</p>
<p>Some women disclosed having unprotected sex, and expressed regret and fear as a result. ‘I trusted my partner but now I feel that I was risking my life (8).’ ‘I feel bad about myself and it affects me mentally (20).’</p>
<p>These data indicate that well-informed, educated Black African women in South African are knowledgeable about HIV risk, yet remain vulnerable in their private lives when the cultural prescriptions about gender identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353512439190">Abdool Karim, 2005</xref>) encourage them to compromise their personal power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353512439190">Jewkes and Morrell, 2010</xref>). Knowledge about HIV has not eliminated high-risk behaviors, even among these educated and financially independent women.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0959353512439190" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The study is, by necessity, limited in scope. It does not explore the personal attitudes of males as reported by men. Unknown factors may also have limited the participant pool. Some of the schools contacted did not allow the research, and in the schools where we collected data, the women may have self-selected due to individual factors such as personal openness to sharing intimate information. In some cases the participants did not finish the questionnaires, and occasional items were omitted. Some of the participants wrote very sparse statements. Thus, the results do not generalize to all Black African men and women in South Africa. However, broad generalizability is not the goal of qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353512439190">Morrow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959353512439190">Willig, 2008</xref>). While Black African female teachers in South Africa were used as a convenience sample in this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959353512439190">Louw et al. (2009)</xref> note that HIV/AIDS in educators compromises the educational system as a whole, and perhaps more importantly, impacts South Africa’s youth who are the future of the country.</p>
<p>Our investigation has special relevance to the HIV epidemic in South Africa given persistent post-apartheid silences about the relationships between gender, sex and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959353512439190">McFadden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512439190">O’Manique and MacLean, 2010</xref>), the higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS for women and some disappointing outcome data regarding the effectiveness of public safe sex awareness campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353512439190">Glick and Sahn, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Black African men and women in South Africa face enormous challenges in their rapidly changing society as they reconstruct gender roles in a way that integrates the effects of racialized history under colonization, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959353512439190">Hunter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959353512439190">Ogundipe-Leslie, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959353512439190">Patil, 2009</xref>) with their current politicized dialogue about gender and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512439190">Waetjen and Maré, 2010</xref>). The relational discourse among men and women has to come to terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959353512439190">Walker, 2005</xref>) with the reality of a deadly HIV/AIDS epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512439190">O’Manique and MacLean, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The results provide some support for application of Jean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512439190">Baker Miller’s (1987[1976])</xref> Relational-Cultural theory about the matrix of power that impacts the possibilities for communication between dominant and subordinate groups. Our participants revealed a striking diversity in response to male power. Some accepted dominance by men, while some revealed they had effective strategies of resistance. For instance, they maintained that they highly valued their financial independence, and some asserted a right to protect their health. These strategies have survival value for Black African women in South Africa because they allow women to move away from harmful aspects of relationships while continuing to seek connection in a way that allows authentic representation of their sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959353512439190">Baker-Miller and Stiver, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of the contradictions in their relationships, their overall discourse about sexual relationships was enthusiastically positive. These intersecting factors raise some questions. Does the joy of sex motivate submission, or does the intersection of joy in conflict with subordination generate resistance? Although a few of these women had chosen to remain single, for most of the women, sexual expression in a partnership was important for their health and happiness.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353512439190">Gupta (2002)</xref> challenged the public health community to move the discourse about sexuality from a disease framework to a message about sexual health, pleasure and rights that does not reinforce damaging stereotypes. Our participants demonstrated a need for a change in sexual health policy as they renegotiated gender roles with males. Clearly, abstinence education would not be a respectful approach for our population but promoting sexual agency could have negative consequences as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512439190">Bredström, 2006</xref>) for women who can be labeled as ‘whores’ when they act in ways that challenge their racialized gender roles.</p>
<p>Working with couples may be more effective than targeting individuals and groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353512439190">Gupta, 2002</xref>). Both men and women police these gender boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959353512439190">McFadden, 2003</xref>), but renegotiation may be more successful now that Black African men in South Africa are facing a conflicting set of values about manhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959353512439190">Hunter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353512439190">Jewkes and Morrell, 2010</xref>). The century old mechanisms for proving manhood are threatened by the realities of 21st-century life. However, because Black South African men are transitioning at uneven rates and degrees from the effects of their culturally subordinate racial roles under apartheid, only some are questioning traditional authoritarian forms of masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959353512439190">Walker, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959353512439190">Narismula (2003)</xref> and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959353512439190">Ogundipe-Leslie, 1994</xref>) doubt that adequate solutions will be found in the individualism that is promoted by Euro-centric or western culture.</p>
<p>We believe men and women must have equal power to control their sexual relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959353512439190">Ehrhardt et al., 2009</xref>), and with support more of these women may be able to challenge the assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353512439190">Ackermann and de Klerk, 2002</xref>) that they have little influence in the sexual choices of the men in their lives. In order for South Africa to transcend the patriarchal cultural constraints of gender, citizens must hold their leaders accountable for sending mixed messages. The urgency with which HIV/AIDS must be addressed leaves little room for tolerating leaders such as Zuma when they mock and threaten feminist progress.</p></sec>
