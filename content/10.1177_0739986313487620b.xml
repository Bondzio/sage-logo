<p>The limits of my language are the limits of my world.</p>
<attrib>Ludwig Wittgenstein</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s quote characterizes the many challenges faced by English language learners in California as well as in the United States. This issue forms the central concern of Guadalupe Valdés, Sarah Capitelli, and Laura Alvarez’s book, <italic>Latino Children Learning English: Steps in the Journey</italic>; their main point is that “academic futures everywhere will depend primarily on their success in becoming proficient readers” (Valdés, Capitelli, &amp; Alvarez, 2011, p. 3). In this book, the authors display a deep understanding of the many challenges that come with acquiring a second language and present data on second language learning. They also highlight the lack of research concerning second language acquisition for children since much of the data are specific to adults. They agree that some debate still exists about the most effective ways for children to rapidly learn English. They acknowledge that learning English has been proven to be a very challenging task for “newly” arrived immigrants who often are not given necessary support and resources. The book explores the different types of instructional services available for elementary school children who are English learners, the challenges of linguistic isolation due to residential segregation, the unreliable assessments, the impacts of policies, and much more. Furthermore, the book focuses on a longitudinal study conducted by the authors in Golden Hills Elementary School; beyond surveying the available research, the authors present results of a 5-year study with 9 young English language learners who participated in a one-on-one English after-school intervention program. This program offered the opportunity and the exposure for non-English speakers to have “English buddies” providing contact with the societal language. Although Valdés et al.’s study is limited in its sample size and lacks a control group, their data do strengthen the field of second language acquisition and contribute to the understanding of the complexity of acquiring a second language for teachers, students, researchers, and policy makers as well as how to assess students’ progress differently.</p>
<p>Valdés and her colleagues were clear in the goal of their research, which was to increase the understanding of the process of the second language (L2) acquisition in children when they had frequent and consistent access to English. Valdés et al. understood that their study would not create broadscale educational solutions as it was based on a small sample size, but they wanted to illustrate how challenging it was for these students to learn English and to counter the myth that children learn a second language easily. Their study strives to lay the foundation for more research related to second language learning and to develop a strong understanding of the process to give policy makers and educators realistic expectations.</p>
<p>According to Valdés, “policy makers want to mandate the implementation of effective practices for accelerating children’s acquisition of English and teachers want to understand how best to teach English language learners” (Valdés et al., 2011, p. 17). Although this gives a much needed imperative for schools to focus on ELLs and hold schools accountable for students’ progress, the tests that are used may not be adequate indicators of students’ progress. Therefore, Valdés et al. assessed students’ ability to communicate to their “English buddies” by observing rather than testing them. Valdés and her colleagues believe that students should be supported even if their English language proficiency is “defective” at first. In their observations, researchers assumed that if students are capable of communicating clearly in oral or written English, even if their English is not grammatically correct, this denotes progress and supports related findings that show that only 5% of second-language learners achieve native-like competence (Valdés et al., 2011). Valdés understands “the challenges related to the assessment of English language learners in the current policy context and in the light of our limited knowledge about second language acquisition in children” (Valdés et al., 2011, p. 35). To hold schools accountable for students’ English proficiency, there must be a valid and reliable assessment to measure the progress of students in functional competence in both communicative and written form: “The assessment of ELLs used in schools today must address both content area knowledge and progress in learning English” (Valdés et al., 2011, p. 37). Distinguished researchers agree “we have much to learn not only about assessing language growth and development uniformity but also about the ways in which language limitations interact with the measurement of content area knowledge in standardized assessments” (Valdés et al., 2011, p. 39). Therefore, Valdés et al. present an educational model in which children have access to the mainstream language through their interaction with their “English buddies” and the way the researchers assess progress is validated by both its meticulous and comprehensive analysis spanning across their 5-year study.</p>
<p>Valdés et al. do not take full credit for the improvement of the children’s language proficiency because they know that there are many factors impacting learning in the children; yet if this study had a larger sample size and a control group, it would have been possible to derive a clearer perception of the influence of English buddies on the learning of children. When the sample size is based on only 9 students, it is hard to make generalizations and even harder to create credible recommendations. Despite these critical weaknesses, the work of Valdes et al. provides new principles for designing an integrated practice for educating ELLs and new examples of materials and activities to engage the children in English-language interaction. That being said, the authors are upfront about the limitations of their work.</p>
<p>This book could have had more impact if it offered tangible solutions and specific recommendations for policy makers; however, that was not the goal of the authors. They do present the two sides of research on second language acquisition, yet more emphasis is put on the research affecting Latino English language learners and not English learners from other groups. If funding had permitted a larger sample size of ELLs and a control group, the study would have been more credible.</p>
