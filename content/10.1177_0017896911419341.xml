<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Information regarding the stability of physical activity (PA) participation across the lifespan is central to efforts to understand and promote this complex behavior. Participation in PA during childhood and adolescence are frequently mentioned as factors related to more active lifestyles with health benefits in adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911419341">1</xref></sup> However, sedentary lifestyles among adolescents, adults and seniors are common and PA decreases across the lifespan, with a particularly large reduction during adolescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911419341">2</xref></sup> The decrease starts in early adolescence, and continues into later adolescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911419341">3</xref></sup> Exercise behavior observation studies suggest that the low level of physical activity in adolescence transfers to adulthood and then remains stable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911419341">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911419341">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911419341"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911419341"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911419341"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911419341"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911419341">9</xref></sup> Results of a cross-sectional study in Iranian students aged 12–14 years showed the average number of minutes spent in daily sports activities was 45.7 minutes compared to 38.2 minutes among those aged 15–17 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911419341">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to some longitudinal studies, beliefs and the social and physical environment are factors that may influence exercise behavior. For example, Wu and Jwo showed that interpersonal influences and cognition variables related to physical activity were stable across grades in Taiwanese adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911419341">11</xref></sup> Garcia found gender-specific changes in physical activity beliefs and behavior during the transition from elementary to junior high school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911419341">12</xref></sup> In a seven-year study, De Bourdeauhuij found higher stability in psychosocial determinants like perceived benefits and barriers in men and women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911419341">13</xref></sup> Other researchers have suggested participation in several different types of sports,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911419341">14</xref></sup> belonging to a sports club,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911419341">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911419341">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911419341">15</xref></sup> or having regular physical activity during adolescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911419341">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911419341">16</xref></sup> resulted in higher stability of physical activity and contributed to the maintenance of physical activity from adolescent into adult or later life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911419341">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Results of empirical studies have shown that psychosocial factors related to physical activity change during different periods of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911419341">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911419341">17</xref></sup> One of the important periods of life is the transition from secondary school to high school. In Iranian culture, academic success is very important and predicts later academic success. Thus parents and teachers impose a lot of pressure on students to do well in academic pursuits at the cost of time spent being physically active. The transition from secondary to high school may also lead to changes in interpersonal relationships, peer pressure and influence, modeling and cognitive factors that are associated with PA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911419341">18</xref></sup> Due to cultural expectations, these factors may be particularly salient for Iranian girls. For example, the expectations from parents to study and to be at home may inhibit participation in PA. Therefore, entry to high school is an appropriate time to track changes in PA among Iranian youth.</p>
<p>This study used Pender’s Health Promotion Model (HPM) as a theoretical framework for measuring change in PA and possible cognitive correlates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911419341">19</xref></sup> This model is derived from social cognitive theory and presents a coherent integration of the multiple factors influencing health behavior. The HPM classifies health behavior determinants into three specific propositional groupings: (1) individual characteristics and experiences; (2) behavior specific cognitions (e.g. perceived benefits and barriers of action, perceived self-efficacy) and affect; and (3) interpersonal influences (social factors that influence health behavior). The HPM constructs are known as important determinants of physical activity behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911419341">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911419341">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911419341"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911419341"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911419341"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911419341">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>How these specific cognitions could influence the acceptance and continuation of PA during different periods of life is investigated in a few longitudinal exercise studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911419341">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911419341">13</xref></sup> However, it is not yet fully known how physical activity beliefs and behavior change and if there are gender differences on correlates of PA, particularly in different cultures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand how changes in cognitive factors (perceived benefits, barriers and self-efficacy), and interpersonal influences (including social support, interpersonal norms and modeling) are associated with youth exercise during the transition from secondary to high school. A further purpose was to evaluate the effects of time and sex on psychosocial factors and physical activity level and to test the stability of psychological variables and the effects of interpersonal influences on exercise behavior using Pender’s Health Promotion Model framework in students in Sanandaj, Iran.</p>
<p>Considering the results of previous research10 it was hypothesized that: (1) there would be a decline in positive beliefs and an increase in negative beliefs; and (2) there would be different patterns among boys and girls for beliefs and stability of psychosocial factors. To our knowledge this is the first theoretically-based longitudinal research that examines PA behavior in Iranian students. The study findings can help to create effective interventions tailored for the acceptance and continuation of adolescent physical activity with this population.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>In 2006, adolescents were identified using a cluster random sampling method. Based on the results of a pilot study and using a .95 confidence level, it was concluded that a sample size of 1,073 would give adequate power. Eight female junior high schools and eight male high schools were randomly selected from 100 schools located in Sanandaj, Iran. At the junior high schools, six classes from each grade, 7–9 (mean age of students 14.37 [<italic>SD</italic> = 1.6] years, range: 12–15, 52% female) were selected for inclusion in a cross-sectional study based on Pender’s health promotion model. Participants provided contact information and were again contacted in 2009 for the follow-up study. Due to change of address, access to 190 students was not possible. Therefore, the sample size for the longitudinal study was N = 883 (age range in 2009: 15–18; grade 10–12; 49% female). The ethical committee of Kurdistan University Medical sciences approved the study. The participants were informed about the aim of the study and informed consent was obtained from all participants. The school physical education teachers were asked to help with data collection. The aim of the research and instructions on how to complete the questionnaires were explained by a research assistant to the students. Data collection took place during physical education classes and the questionnaires were administered to students in their classrooms. The physical education teacher remained in the room during questionnaire administration and answered any questions. For each of the next six consecutive days (Saturday through Thursday) each participant completed a child/adolescent/activity log (CAAL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911419341">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>All measures were translated into Persian by a bilingual researcher and then validated using the standard back translation technique by a native Persian who was also fluent in English. Instruments were evaluated by five experts (PhD level) in health behavior, exercise psychology, and instrument design and then pilot tested for appropriateness. Following the piloting of questionnaires with 115 participants, revisions in wording and presentation were made based on empirical findings and recommendations from participants in the pilot study. Several items that are pertinent to Iranian culture were added to the final instruments. Because of the emphasis in Iranian culture on family bonds and parents as authority figures, items consistent with this were included. ‘Exercise even though I have family chores to complete’ was added to the self-efficacy scale (i.e. coping self-efficacy), and ‘I don’t have my parents’ approval’ was added to the barriers scale. For the current study, questionnaires were administered to students in their classrooms.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section10-0017896911419341">
<title>Physical activity</title>
<p>Participation in PA was assessed using a modified version of the child/adolescent activity log.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911419341">24</xref></sup> The CAAL asks respondents to recall the activities (any time they were moving) that they participated in the previous day and the number of minutes of each. Participants keep a log of their time spent in PA for six consecutive days (Saturday to Thursday). The average number of minutes spent in PA each day is calculated by dividing total minutes by number of days. Minor changes in questions were made for Iranian adolescents. For example, some activities in the CAAL such as ice hockey and ice or roller skating were inappropriate for Iranian adolescents and were replaced with popular activities with Iranian boys such as mountaineering, skateboarding, vast-vast, khat-khat (ball games), and seven stone (similar to hopscotch). The one-week test–re-test reliability of the CAAL with 115 Iranian adolescents selected through cluster random sampling of schools in Sanandaj, Iran, was .98.</p>

<sec id="section11-0017896911419341">
<title>Psychosocial variables</title>
<p>Perceived benefits are defined as positive or reinforcing aspects of PA and were examined using a modified version of the scale developed by Garcia and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911419341">24</xref></sup> The eight-item measure uses a four-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>not at all true</italic> to 4 = <italic>very true</italic>). The two-week test–re-test reliability of the perceived benefits scale was <italic>r</italic> = .89, and the alpha coefficient was α = .83 in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0017896911419341">
<title>Perceived barriers</title>
<p>These refer to real or imagined impediments that prevent or make participation in PA difficult and were measured using a modified version of the scale developed by Garcia and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911419341">25</xref></sup> The 10 items use a 4fourpoint Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all true</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very true</italic>). The two-week test–re-test reliability of the scale was <italic>r</italic> = .77, and the alpha coefficient was α = .78 in the study sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0017896911419341">
<title>Exercise self-efficacy</title>
<p>This was assessed using a modified version of an eight-item scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911419341">24</xref></sup> in which respondents were asked to indicate their confidence in their ability to be active in a variety of situations. Items are scored on a four-point Likert type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all confident</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very confident</italic>). The one-week test–re-test reliability of the self-efficacy scale was <italic>r</italic> = .77, and the alpha coefficient was α = .90 in the study population.</p>
<p>The <italic>social support</italic> scale required respondents to indicate how much support they receive from family, siblings, and friends to increase their PA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911419341">25</xref></sup> The 24 items (six for each sub-scale measuring social support provided by mother, father, siblings, and friends) use a three-point scale (1 = <italic>never</italic> to 3 = <italic>often</italic>). The alpha coefficients of the separate social support sub-scales were .85 for mother’s support and .83 for father’s support, and those for siblings and peers ranged from .75 to .84.</p>
<p>The <italic>exposure to modeling</italic> scale was used to assess the respondents’ perceptions of the activity levels of significant others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911419341">25</xref></sup> Respondents were asked to report how often their family members or peers performed light, medium, and hard PA. Responses were assessed on 12 items using a three-point scale from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 3 (<italic>often</italic>). The one-week test–re-test reliability of the exposure to models scale was <italic>r</italic> = .80, and the alpha coefficient was α = .84.</p>
<p><italic>Interpersonal norms</italic> refer to the expectations of significant others to participate in PA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911419341">12</xref></sup> This was measured using four items on a three-point scale, with responses ranging from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 3 (<italic>often</italic>).

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 16 was used for all statistical analyses. After deleting cases with incomplete or missing data (<italic>n</italic> = 39), a final sample of 844 participants was included in the analysis. Mean and standard deviation variables of physical activity, psychosocial factors and interpersonal influences were calculated. To assess differences in cognitive variables, interpersonal influence and exercise behavior from the beginning until the follow-up, paired t-tests were separately done for boys and girls.</p>
<p>A combined score for interpersonal influence of peers and friends and parents for each sub-group (e.g. social support, interpersonal norms and modeling) was created. The mean parental social support (through fathers and mothers) and peer support (through peers, friends and classmates) were calculated. The same procedures were used to build a combined score of the parental modeling, peer modeling and interpersonal norms. Repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were conducted to assess the effects of time (within groups) and sex (between groups) and the interaction effects between sex and time on psychosocial factors, interpersonal influence and level of physical activity were also examined. The relative stability of physical activity psychosocial correlates (such as cognition and interpersonal influences) from wave 1 until the wave 2 using Pearson product-moment correlation was tested</p>

<p>The follow-up findings indicate decreasing physical activity levels in girls and boys compared with the initial time and the pair tests results showed a significant reduction of activity for both sexes. The findings showed reductions in perceived self-efficacy and benefits and increasing perceived barriers for boys and girls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0017896911419341">Table 2</xref>). The within-participant effects indicated significant differences for PA and most psychosocial variables associated with the exercise of boys and girls from baseline to follow-up (p &lt; 0.01–0.001). There was a significant difference between wave 1 to wave 2 for mean PA minutes. At follow-up, both girls and boys reported significantly less PA than the baseline. During the three-year period, perceived benefits and self-efficacy decreased, and perceived barriers increased in both genders. Further, less social support of family and more support from friends was reported for boys and girls. In addition, both genders reported less exposure to physically-active parents.</p>

Some significant interactions between genders and grade transition were also found on psychosocial variables. Girls perceived less social support from parents and peers, and less exposure to active modeling and interpersonal norms compared with boys over the three years. In addition, adolescent girls reported more perceived barriers, less significant perceived benefits and lower self-efficacy than boys.

<sec id="section16-0017896911419341" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first longitudinal research on adolescent physical activity in Iran. Consistent with other research, our results confirm decreasing levels of physical activity among adolescent girls and boys during a three-year transition from secondary school to high school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911419341">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911419341">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911419341">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911419341">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911419341">27</xref></sup> In Iran, entry to high school coincides with choosing courses and participating in various weekly and monthly exams to prepare for success in the entrance exam to universities. The tendency of students and their families to continue higher education have dramatically increased in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911419341">28</xref></sup> Therefore, students must take a lot of time for academic success, resulting in a reduction in the time spent being active. However, the decline in PA and psychosocial factors associated with PA is greater for Iranian girls than boys. Physical activity level during the three-years decreased to a greater extent in female students and the time spent in sporting activities was about half that of boys. These results are similar to findings in Taiwanese, Australian and English girls, and Vietnamese adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911419341">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911419341">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911419341">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Iranian girls also reported fewer perceived benefits and self-efficacy, and more perceived barriers compared with boys both before and after the transition. In addition to the barriers females face in western societies with an active lifestyle, women in Iran encounter two unique potential barriers to being active. The first is an increase in girls attending university, such that they now have greater acceptance to Iranian universities than do boys. At the same time, social and family norms regarding girls not exercising outdoors or participating in sports, while also having less access to space for physical exercise compared to boys, represent individual and environmental barriers for an active lifestyle in Iranian women.</p>
<p>However, the study findings indicate a relative stability in the psychosocial factors associated with physical activity despite greater barriers for the girls. When designing intervention programs to promote youth physical activities, health professionals must identify the barriers to exercise behavior and provide strategies to strengthen the ability of the target group to overcome personal and environmental obstacles. The results of two studies that tested Pender’s Health Promotion model constructs with physical activity behavior in Kurdistan adolescents confirmed the indirect effect of interpersonal influences on physical activity through the psychosocial factors associated with exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911419341">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911419341">29</xref></sup> The findings of the current study showed decreasing social support and less exposure to the family model after a three-year period for both genders. Therefore, to strengthen perceptual and cognitive factors, such as benefits and efficacy associated with exercise, it may be necessary for interventions to target cooperation, encouragement and support from parents and other influential people to having an active lifestyle. Encouraging parents to be positive role models through doing more sport activities may also help.</p>
<p>Similar to other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911419341">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911419341">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896911419341">30</xref></sup> on the effect of time on perceived barriers, the results revealed increased barriers for physical activity in male and female students at follow-up. Results of previous studies aimed at understanding the physical activity barriers in Kurdistan students suggested some obstacles such as lack of time and activity not being a preferred behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911419341">29</xref></sup> The problem of not having enough time for PA is largely justified by the pressures from family and school. Therefore, strategies and time management during education transition years to perform school sports and to integrate physical activity in daily life are important. In efforts to improve adherence, mandatory physical education classes in Iranian schools may target the feelings associated with individual bouts of exercise, and the cumulative emotional changes associated with exercise over time. For example, one might develop activities around a student’s like and dislikes.</p>
<p>The correlations between physical activity, psychosocial factors and interpersonal influences of onset until the follow-up study showed lower correlations compared with the study conducted by Wu and Jwo in Taiwanese adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911419341">11</xref></sup> A possible justification for this is the three-year period, compared with a one-year study in Taiwan. Further, the comparison of correlation coefficients of physical activity and related factors of this review with studies in Belgium and Taiwan have similarities and contradictions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911419341">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911419341"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911419341">13</xref></sup> Similarly to Taiwanese and Belgian youth, there were higher correlation coefficients for girls than boys for parental influences such as exposure to models, interpersonal norms as well as perceived barriers from the baseline until the follow-up. Lower relative stability of the perceived benefits and self-efficacy and exercise behavior of female students compared with boys in the current study is different to the results for Taiwanese adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911419341">11</xref></sup> Despite the important role of peer groups in adolescent social development, the greater effects of family rather than peer influences on female students highlights the important role of families in encouraging Iranian girls to be active. This trend was contrary to the male students which highlighted the role of peers rather than family. Higher correlations for psychosocial variables than exercise behavior suggests that the cognitions are more stable than behavior. Why this is so remains to be determined.</p>

<sec id="section17-0017896911419341" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is recognized that individual attitudes in certain situations will not necessarily lead to behavior and there are conditions when attitudes are in conflict with group and cultural norms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0017896911419341">31</xref></sup> There likely are sociocultural, economic, environmental and other factors that influence this relationship and were not included in the current study. Our findings reflected other work in which the correlation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911419341">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911419341">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0017896911419341">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0017896911419341">33</xref></sup> was higher in males than females with a decrease over time in females and males. While there are some differences between the current study (e.g. sample population, age, and duration of the study) that can help explain the different results, it is clear there are gender differences and physical activity was more stable in males than females. It is possible that life changes, such as getting married and having children, may affect woman’s PA in young adulthood more than men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911419341">1</xref></sup> While getting married and having children are not issues for the female participants in the current study due to their age, the barriers Iranian women face as they leave school warrants examination, particularly as Iranian women of school age are already not very active.</p>
<p>This study is the first to observe cognitive-conceptual changes in interpersonal influence for physical activity behavior in Iranian adolescents during the transition from secondary school to high school. The results showed differences in psychological factors and exercise behavior among boys and girls. The findings support the strength of longitudinal research with physical activity behavior of youth. Utilizing the findings of longitudinal studies may lead to the detection of changes in cognitive factors related to exercise behavior. Because of reduced physical activity level in male and female students during the transition, as well as reduced perceived efficacy, benefits and increasing perceived barriers, the design and implementation of appropriate interventions aimed at positive effects on cognitive-psychosocial factors related and promoting physical activity level during high school students are necessary.</p>
<p>Transition from secondary school to high school revealed lower physical activity level in boys and girls although girls were even less active than boys. During the transition from secondary school to high school, perceived barriers increased in both sexes. The most important perceived barriers were lack of time, not enjoying exercise, and not having social support. This highlights the need for time management training for doing homework as well as creating enjoyable physical education experiences. It is important to consider the positive role of peer groups in providing social support, expectations of having more physical activity and modeling, especially in boys. The facilitation of sports activities in school and considering its importance in the physical and psychosocial development of adolescent causes more peer influence on each other. The relative stability of family interpersonal influences in girls compared with boys indicates a need for attention to the role of parents to provide more social support and modeling for an active lifestyle in girls. More stable cognitions related to PA than exercise point out planning, implementing intervention programs to promote positive attitudes toward PA because of persistent effects, also particular attention to factors that cause lack of consistency between attitude and exercise behavior. According to the three-year period of this research, conducting longitudinal studies with a shorter time frame to recognize changes in psychosocial factors associated with physical activity is recommended. Further, tailored interventions to increase positive attitudes and self-efficacy related to exercise and to promote physical activity behavior in boys and girls in particular are needed.</p>
