(2012) on the place of ‘classics’ within geographical literature and on the possibilities of identifying canonical works, I focus on the criteria for selection and how such works might be identified. As an example, I analyze the history of inclusion in the ‘Classics revisited’ series in the journal <italic>Progress in Human Geography</italic>, and pose questions to prompt reflection on the role of language of publication, national origins of authors, and interest in particular paradigms and subfields within the discipline as influences on selection. Additionally, I ask how the temporal and spatial contexts of readers and their motivations shape interpretations of works, what this implies in responses to ‘classics’, and for the possibilities of identifying a ‘canon’.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>canon</kwd><kwd>classics</kwd><kwd>reader orientations</kwd><kwd>selection criteria</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>In reflecting on representations of the histories of geography, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468550">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) ask whether there is a canon in the discipline. They explore some implications of identifying a canon for how the field (specifically human geography) has been or might be imagined. They ask why some texts recur in histories of the discipline, though not with sustained approbation, while others are marginalized. Their paper is partly prompted by the recent publications of compendia, texts on ‘key thinkers’ and the like, aimed at student audiences. Is there a canon and is such identification the same as being deemed classical?</p><p>Shortly before being invited to be part of the 2011 panel discussion that preceded this paper, a friend gave me the book <italic>Who’s Afraid of Jane Austen?: How to Really Talk about Books You Haven’t Read </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468550">Hitchings, 2008</xref>). I have not read many of the authors Hitchings includes, authors whose works would certainly count as classics in western literature, and possibly canonical. Among them are Virgil, Homer, Aesop, Proust, Cervantes, and Tolstoy. I admit to gaps in my reading in geography – of works that might count as canonical (for example, by Humboldt or Ritter) – though my generation of students had to know <italic>of</italic> them from courses in the history of geography. I have only browsed Semple’s <italic>Influences of the Geographic Environment</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2043820612468550">1</xref></sup> but enough to recognize that is it more complex than stereotypically represented. I have, however, read her article on the Anglo-Saxons of the Kentucky mountains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612468550">Semple, 1901</xref>), because its field-based research with women is of interest to my own research. Reading reflects one’s motivation.</p><p>In contrasting the canonical (i.e. significant works by ‘founding’ figures) with the classical, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468550">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) discuss the series ‘Classics revisited’ in <italic>Progress in Human Geography</italic>. Introducing it in 1991, the editors indicated that ISI citations would be a source for making selections, thus reflecting a presentist criterion for significance. They also established the practice of asking authors to respond to commentaries, thus further restricting the selection to living geographers. Subsequently, the series ‘Textbooks that moved generations’ was added. Combining the genres, across the series I identified 72 titles included by 2011, most of which were published in the late 20th century, slightly less than 10% before 1960 and almost 60% after 1970. The longest period between publication and inclusion as a research classic was 52 years – for Gilbert White’s 1945 paper ‘Human adjustment to flood plains’, recognized in 1997. It was a key work, initiating the field of hazards research and was important for public policy. White received many accolades for his contributions, among them the US National Medal of Science, an IGU Lauréat d’Honneur, and a United Nations Environmental Prize. One might have expected earlier selection in the series for a paper that might be regarded as canonical and not only classical; yet I also noted that the subfield that emerged from his work is not generally addressed in the series. The fastest recognitions as classics were for economic geography: Doreen Massey’s 1984 <italic>Spatial Divisions of Labour</italic>, featured after 9 years, and Jamie Peck’s 1996 book, <italic>Work/Place</italic>, within 12 years of its publication.</p><p>The books, texts, and articles selected are works in English. There are other interesting distinctions. The textbook selections tend to have earlier dates of initial publication than the research ones, and often appeared in multiple editions. All but one were published prior to 1960, including Homer Hoyt’s 1939 text selected in 2005 and Finch and Trewartha’s <italic>Elements of</italic> <italic>Geography</italic> first published in 1936, though it was the 1949 3rd edition selected in 2002. Maybe these texts did ‘move generations’, but were they canonical in shaping geographic knowledge?</p><p>Perhaps most striking to me in the classics series is the origin of the authors. It prompts me to ask: are British-born geographers more prone than others to writing worthy of identification as ‘classic’? Of the 72 works, I think only 12 of the authors are US-born (one of whom worked for a long time in Britain), and of those other than the US-born a dozen are British-born who have spent significant parts of their careers in North America. Torsten Hägerstrand is the only non-native speaker of English included. US geographers, however, make up a considerable number of the textbook authors.</p><p>Examining the locations and origins of selections is worth further exploration. Ron Johnston’s multi-edition <italic>Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Geography since 1945</italic> was identified as a classic in 2007. Responding to the review, he acknowledged that the common language seemed a convenient reason for the linkage between British and North American geography, suggesting however that research became more similar in recent years. Yet, he notes that developments did not always proceed in tandem. His discussions of behavioral geography, for example, emphasized US work. Such differences raise questions about how contexts and networks shape interpretations of the histories of geography. What audiences might deem a work canonical? And what about some 20th century works not included in the series though widely known and used for generations? Richard Hartshorne’s <italic>The Nature of Geography </italic>(first published 1939), for example, was long the subject of often heated debates and defense and was required reading for generations of graduate students, at least in the United States. It yielded Hartshorne’s follow-up work <italic>Perspectives on the Nature of Geography</italic> (1959) and an edited book of commentaries on the 50th anniversary of publication of <italic>The Nature</italic> by a diverse set of geographers. But is it a classic? Was it canonical in forming visions of what geography encompasses? Interestingly, the classics series includes no pieces by Carl Sauer, an enduring figure for much of the 20th century in cultural geography and landscape studies but perhaps more in American geography than beyond, though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468550">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) consider his canonical role. So while language of publication is one aspect to consider in assessing canonicity, other limitations are evident on the selections of ‘classics’ identified in <italic>Progress in Human Geography</italic>, among them the criterion of inviting responses from authors of the works selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612468550">Dicken et al., 1991</xref>). This would have excluded an array of influential American human geographers of the interwar period and beyond, such as Chauncy Harris (important in shaping urban geography and for his work on the Soviet Union), Preston James (oriented to regional studies, especially Latin America), and earlier figures such as political geographer Derwent Whittlesey. Would their works be considered canonical? Keighren and colleagues advocate considering diverse time periods in exploring classics and canonicity.</p><p>What if we think more inclusively about geography? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468550">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) draw attention to work in geographic education, a theme of interest to me especially as one that speaks to the representation of women in the discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468550">Monk, 2004</xref>). And what about physical geography? William Morris Davis might be seen as foundational and not only in the American context. His models were still taught in my undergraduate geography courses in Australia in the 1950s. Examination of a decade of the ‘classics’ in <italic>Progress in Physical Geography</italic> after 2000 reveals some notable differences from the human geography selections. About 75% of the 43 works included were published before 1970 and about a quarter before 1950. National origins of authors and publishers are wider than those in the human geography series, including French, German, Swedish, Japanese, and Chinese, some not writing in English. The selections imply a different set of criteria in defining classics in the field and possibly a different academic culture.</p><p>Theorists commonly cited in contemporary human geography include a substantial array of 20th century western European scholars from outside geography – most often, perhaps, Foucault, but also Lefebvre, Bourdieu, Derrida, Deleuze, and Guattari, and at various times Baurillard, Castells, Gramsci, and Agamben. For the most part, I expect that their works emerged into Anglophone geography after their translation into English. I do not wish to imply that geographers should isolate themselves from work from outside the discipline or be confined within their own national–linguistic boundaries. Recently, however, non-Anglophone geographers have expressed concerns about Anglophone hegemonies and the implications for dissemination of their own work, not only because of language but for approaches, and of the relations between language and traditions of thought. German and French geographers used to get attention in history of geography courses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2043820612468550">2</xref></sup> I also think about the translation of Anglophone geographic writing into other languages and of collaborative writing by Anglophone geographers’ colleagues with those from other regions. How might such work be evaluated in the canons of geography? Does it contribute to widening discourses or to extending Anglo hegemonies? Journals in languages other than English often are not ISI rated, so how might that affect what is or is not selected as classic? We may also be in an era when the proliferation of encyclopedias, handbooks, and companions may contribute to canonizing works or authors not read in the original or in depth. In other words, going back to my opening, they may serve as aids to ‘really talking about books you haven’t read’.</p><p>I’ll conclude with some comments about writing, reading, and citations, using an example from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612468550">Monk and Hanson’s (1982)</xref> article ‘On not excluding half of the human in human geography’, not because I am claiming it as a classic, but because of what I know about its trajectory. For an ‘anti-anthology’ in feminist geography (Moss and Al-Hindi, 2008), a collection that includes some pieces in languages other than English and by geographers from several countries, Susan Hanson and I were invited to write a reflection on our article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612468550">Hanson and Monk, 2008</xref>). To prepare, we examined 20 plus years of ISI citations as well as those in various compendia. Our search revealed evolving interpretations. Initially, these reflected goals of authors that differed from that our title envisioned. Some from Britain, Canada, and Australia saw us as remiss in not writing instead, or as well, on radical and socialist feminist perspectives that were being advanced in their own contexts. By the 1990s, some referenced our paper as a key work in what has become known as feminist geography. An author not engaged in feminist research, an audience that we had hoped to reach, used it to explain why he was integrating gender into previously gender-blind research in population geography. Some recent citations have referenced it in discussions of changing ways of knowing in relation to issues of identities or of a shift in geographic writing from visual to aural metaphors. Then there are what I might call ‘ritual citings’ in recent compendia, some of which change the order of authorship, leaving one to wonder if the paper was actually consulted. In other words, the uses and interpretations of the paper have reflected positionality and temporality in its reading or citation. How then might contemporary readers deal with classics, however selected, or a canon unless the readers are well prepared or motivated to explore them in relation to the contexts and purposes for which they were written and for the audiences the authors envisioned as well as contemporary ones? Does being a classic imply that a work is timeless or of enduring value? What criteria would shape inclusion in a canon? Does geography have its Jane Austens? And will we ‘really read’ them in order to talk about them?</p></body><back><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2043820612468550"><label>1.</label><p>Interestingly, someone currently has this book checked out from my university library, indicating that it has apparently not ‘died’.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-2043820612468550"><label>2.</label><p>I may be among the last generation of students in American geography who were required to pass reading exams in French and German as a part of their doctoral curriculum.</p></fn></fn-group></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612468550"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dicken</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1991</year>) <article-title>Classics in human geography revisited: Introduction to a new series</article-title>. <source>Progress in Human Geography</source> <volume>15</volume>(<issue>3</issue>): <fpage>299</fpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-2043820612468550"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hanson</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Monk</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2008</year>) <article-title>On not excluding redux</article-title>.
