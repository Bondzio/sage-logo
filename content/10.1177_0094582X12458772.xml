<abstract>
<p>In the past few years Mexico has experienced an increase in the price of tortillas much greater than that of the national consumer price index, the minimum wage, and their basic ingredients (corn and corn flour) that has affected the urban families that buy this basic product in the market. Since the tortilla constitutes a symbolic value for the immense majority of Mexicans, it has remained exposed to the laws of the market, increasingly losing its ritual character of time immemorial. Even when its price has increased, its deep roots in Mexican culture have permitted it to remain a basic product for daily consumption, thus generating strong tensions between its price and its cultural-nutritive role. An analysis of the impact of the increase in the price of tortillas on the consumption of low- and high-income households in San Cristóbal de Las Casas, Chiapas, establishes that tortillas represent a Giffen good—a product for which a price increase, far from diminishing its demand, increases it—for poor urban households.</p>
<p>En los últimos años se ha apreciado en México un incremento en el precio de la tortilla muy superior al índice nacional de precios al consumidor, al del salario mínimo y al de sus insumos básicos (maíz en grano y harina de maíz), que ha afectado a las familias residentes en zonas urbanas, las que adquieren este producto básico en el mercado. La tortilla, en tanto que constituye un valor simbólico para la inmensa mayoría de los mexicanos, ha quedado expuesta a las leyes del mercado, perdiendo cada vez más su carácter ritual que tuvo en tiempos immemoriales. Cuando su precio ha tendido al incremento, su arraigo en la cultura mexicana le ha permitido mantenerse como un producto básico de consumo diario, generando así fuertes tensiones entre su precio y su papel cultural-alimenticio. Un análisis del impacto del aumento del precio de la tortilla en el consumo de hogares de ingresos bajo y alto en San Cristóbal de Las Casas, Chiapas, establece que la tortilla representa un bien Giffen—un producto que ante un aumento de precio, lejos de disminuir su demanda, ésta aumenta—para los hogares pobres urbanos.</p>

<p>Corn in Mexico has been studied from a technical perspective as a plant of Mesoamerican origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12458772">Beadle, 1977</xref>) and one with adaptive versatility, being cultivated both at sea level and at high altitudes. It has also attracted attention as an object of study in economics, with analyses of the economic effects of tariffs on corn production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12458772">Calva, 1993</xref>), the effects of the use of this crop for generating energy in the form of ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12458772">SIAP, n.d.</xref>), and the reduction of quality due to its displacement of better-quality native grains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12458772">Appendini, García, and de la Tejera, 2003</xref>). The main objective of this contribution is to apply the concept of Giffen goods in the context of the increase in the price of a product that is essential to the diet of thousands of Mexicans, especially those of the working class. How are the poorest sectors responding to the increase in the price of tortillas? Are they consuming fewer tortillas, or are they reducing their consumption of other food products? In the first section we contextualize the increase in the price of tortillas in Mexico, where tortillas are not just another food but constitutive of the national identity. In the second section, we place the question of corn in the framework of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and in the third we present the economic-theoretical assumptions that will be confronted with the research findings laid out in the fourth.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X12458772">
<title>Corn: Symbolism and National Identity</title>
<p>Jorge Ibargüengoitia has said that the tortilla is for Mexicans “food, dish, flatware, and stability.” It is food in itself and an ingredient of a dish (<italic>tacos</italic>), a spoon for eating other foods, and a source of emotional stability and food security. In contrast to other Mexican food products, it is a cultural artifact that unites and crosses class, ethnicity, and race, a symbol of national identity whose transcendence approaches the domain of the sacred. In the Popol Vuh, a Quiché story, the origin of human beings is traced to corn. The sarcophagus of the king Pakal in Palenque, Chiapas, shows his rebirth as the corn king as proof of his immortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X12458772">Fazio, 2007</xref>). All the Indian myths of Chiapas refer to corn as a sacred food and even as the basis of physical-spiritual creation. The Chilam Balam says that the Mayans were born of corn; corn is equivalent to the dust of the Christian creation. The Huichol people, for example, say, “Corn is our food, corn is sacred. We don’t know how to speak Spanish well, but we do know how to speak with corn” (quoted by Silvia Ribeiro, <italic>La Jornada</italic>, November 2, 2006).</p>
<p>These references suggest that tortillas in Mexico are an ethnic product, but in their historical trajectory they have been assimilated by different social classes and become multicultural. They have crossed borders with Mexican migrants to position themselves as transnational artifacts that endorse the transterritoriality of all that is Mexican. Two studies carried out in the United States report that at the end of the 1990s the tortilla industry was one of the fastest-growing segments of the baking industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X12458772">Cornell, 1998</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12458772">Lind and Barham, 2004</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12458772">Bacon (1996</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12458772">Lind and Barham, 2004</xref>) points out that in 1996 more than 25,000 workers, the majority of them immigrants in the United States, produced tortillas with a value of US$2.5 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X12458772">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Mexico, the political left, in anticipation of the effects of NAFTA on the country’s agricultural production, repeated the slogan “Without corn there is no country” time and time again in marches and demonstrations aimed at the government agencies that deal with the rural economy. This slogan is not only an appropriate metaphor but also a sociological truth, calling to mind Guillermo Prieto’s identification of “the three friends of the poor: corn, beans, and chile” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X12458772">Cepeda, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Before the structural adjustment of prices, Mexican society had already experienced great changes brought about by agro-industrial processes that were presented to the people as evidence of modernity. In its production, tortillas went from being made by hand from <italic>masa</italic> or <italic>nixtamal</italic> (corn paste) and cooked one at a time on the legendary <italic>comal</italic> (clay griddle) to being made from corn flour and industrially stamped out, all alike, in series by a tortilla machine that cooks and ejects them for the market. With the change from corn paste to corn flour the consumption of corn as the traditional drink called <italic>pozol</italic> has nearly been lost. Today Mexico’s tortilla consumers are divided into two groups: rural indigenous people, who consume tortillas made in the traditional way, and city dwellers, both mestizo and indigenous, who consume industrial tortillas whose main ingredient tends increasingly to be made from genetically modified hybrid corn of what are called “high-yield varieties.” Within this vast population are the urban poor. In the context of the market economy, what once was a value for household use, produced, transformed, and consumed in the home, is now a product circulating in a market of exchange values in which sellers and buyers argue over its price.</p>

<sec id="section2-0094582X12458772">
<title>Corn and NAFTA</title>
<p>NAFTA has made Mexico an important actor in the globalization process, participating in the new international division of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12458772">López, Martínez, and Peláez, 2011</xref>). The effects of NAFTA and globalization, however, are not the same for all countries, regions, or sectors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X12458772">2</xref></sup> In the Mexican agricultural sector, subsectors differ with regard to their response to the economic opening. Indigenous agriculture, primarily subsistence, experiences its consequences indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X12458772">Minutti, 2007</xref>). Imports have affected the production of corn because, with low prices, it was initially more profitable to buy corn than to produce it.</p>
<p>With NAFTA, the commercial deficit of the agricultural sector became the norm. Between 1993 and 2009, the balance of trade in the agricultural sector had a surplus only in three years (1993, 1995, and 1997), and corn was a net importer throughout the period, with an important increase in imports in the last three of these years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0094582X12458772">3</xref></sup> In addition, in a number of years (1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2004–2006, and 2009) the trade deficit for corn was greater than for the agricultural sector as a whole. The demand for corn showed less sensitivity to this type of change, since even with the strong devaluation registered in the years 1995 and 1997 it continued to be imported.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0094582X12458772">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The increase in corn imports was a consequence of the stagnation of internal production and of the grain’s prices in the international market. Cultivation was affected not only by NAFTA but also by internal structural factors such as producers’ lack of access to credit, their limited use of irrigation to increase profits, the concentration of the market in a very few private companies, the scarcity of scientific research in this field, and the limited government subsidies compared with those granted to producers in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12458772">CEFP, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Before 2006 the price of imported corn was low, but beginning in that year it increased significantly because of the growing demand for corn for ethanol production in the United States. Beginning in 2007, then, the problem in the market for corn in Mexico worsened because the decline in domestic production, a decline in imports, and stockpiling by the three companies involved (Maseca, Cargill, and Minsa) generated pressure for an increase in the product’s price and consequently an increase in the price of tortillas, the end product in the chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12458772">CEFP, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>With NAFTA Mexican agricultural producers had to cope with cheaper corn coming from the United States, and because of its low price they covered the shortfall of domestic production with increasing imports. Fields were abandoned, corn was replaced by other crops, and farm workers migrated to the United States. Later, when prices increased, imports were revealed to be inelastic and corn farmers were incapable of increasing their production because of the problems just mentioned. Indigenous farmers became buyers of corn when the price was low (between 1997 and 2005)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0094582X12458772">5</xref></sup> and neglected or abandoned its cultivation.</p>
<p>Despite all this, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12458772">Barkin (2006</xref>: 150) points out, some rural-indigenous people have developed survival strategies by diversifying their productive activities:
<disp-quote>
<p>Mexican rural residents (including indigenous communities) are re-orienting themselves and the rural economy in response to the diminishing opportunities in the urban industrial society. These communities have diversified their economies, developing highly specialized quality products, such as organic or fair-trade products, exotic fruits and free-range chicken, as well as production of specialized wood, ecotourism, and even environmental services such as carbon sequestration and restoration of aquifers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The fact remains, however, that NAFTA has had negative repercussions on corn production because of its low productivity with respect to that of the great producers of the North. Small farmers were unable to cope with the initial reduction in price. Before NAFTA they could place their surplus on the local market, but no longer being able to do so they began to migrate in great numbers, as in the case of the producers from the Frailesca region of Chiapas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12458772">Ballinas, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The asymmetry between Mexico and the United States is enormous. Whereas in 1990 productivity per U.S. agricultural worker was 8.5 times greater than that of the Mexican worker, in 2006 it was 11.5 times greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X12458772">Puyana and Romero, 2008</xref>). Asymmetry is also important within Mexico, where national productivity per agricultural worker is 2.6 times greater and productivity in Sonora 8.3 times greater than that in Chiapas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12458772">López, Martínez, and Peláez, 2011</xref>). These differences would be even wider if one compared mechanized agriculture with indigenous agriculture, where productivity is least. As a result, in the more backward regions, where precapitalist production relations prevail, NAFTA has accentuated the breakdown of those relations. In Chiapas the situation is even more complicated because of the coexistence of precapitalist relations with those of backward capitalism. Here we observe a disintegration of the traditional forms of organization of production (indigenous communities, the indigenous rural economy, etc.) and the corresponding failure to absorb the farm labor that was part of that system. In the face of this situation, we end up with the worst of all possible worlds: on the one hand, precapitalists who are unable to retain their workforce and, on the other, a capitalist sector that is incapable of absorbing either this excluded sector or its own workforce. Ultimately, this means the stagnation of the capitalist sector and the breakdown of the noncapitalist one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X12458772">Valenzuela, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus NAFTA threatened rural indigenous agriculture, with its low productivity and its lack of competitiveness, and because of this ethnic groups’ demands increased or became more visible in the public sphere and new social actors emerged. In some cases, new political actors challenged the traditional forms of politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12458772">Bello, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As we have seen, under NAFTA the initial low corn import prices negatively affected producers and then, when prices went up, producers were incapable of responding with greater production because of the structural encumbrances of the corn subsector. The increase in the price of tortillas in recent years has been attributed to this increase in international corn prices. However, the price of corn has increased less than that of tortillas and even slightly less than that of the national consumer price index. It is mainly yellow corn that is imported, and tortillas are produced mainly with white corn. Yellow corn is sometimes used for making tortillas, but it is mostly used for animal feed. If yellow and white corn were entirely differentiated, the yellow would follow U.S. prices while the price of white corn would be determined by the conditions of supply and demand in Mexico. While they are not perfect substitutes for each other, the markets for the two are related—up to a point—both on the supply side (because their production requirements are very similar) and on the demand side (through the possibility of their use as animal feed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X12458772">World Bank and IMCO, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the implementation of NAFTA, the increase in the price of tortillas has been 92 percent more than the increase in the price of corn, 156.5 percent more than the increase in the minimum wage, 88.8 percent more than inflation as measured by the consumer price index, and 35.5 percent more than the price of corn flour. This means that in the chain of production from white corn to tortillas the increase in the price of imported corn generates an increase in benefits that, rather than favoring the corn producers, is distributed through the successive phases of production whereby corn is transformed into flour and finally into tortillas. If the price of tortillas is increasing more than the minimum wage, the real wages of the poor are declining in terms of tortillas. At the same time, if the price of corn is increasing less than that of tortillas and corn flour, its relative price is deteriorating despite the price increases in the international market.</p>
<p>From December 2000 until December 2008, the accumulated price increases were 98.41 percent for tortillas, 69.29 percent for corn flour, and 41.03 percent for corn (Bank of Mexico data)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0094582X12458772">6</xref></sup> under conditions of declining real salaries. This was a blow to the economy in the poorest regions of Mexico, particularly for the poorest urban and rural families, whose nutrition fundamentally depends on tortillas. This situation benefited the firms that monopolize the production of flour for tortillas; the price of tortillas increased 62.17 percent more than that of corn flour and 476.61 percent more than that of corn, and therefore the price of corn flour increased 255.56 percent more than that of corn. This led to significant variation in relative prices that favored flour and tortilla vendors while hurting consumers and corn producers. In other words, there is economic inequality in the chain of corn production in that those who experience the most adversity are the corn producers and the tortilla consumers, mainly those whose incomes are low because of the reduction of real minimum wages in terms of tortillas.</p>
<p>In the case of Chiapas, 271,581 producers of corn are considered to be sub-subsistence (92.2 percent),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0094582X12458772">7</xref></sup> 21,245 medium-sized (7.2 percent),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0094582X12458772">8</xref></sup> 1,600 large or in transition (0.5 percent), and only 42 very large or capitalist (0.01 percent) (SAGARPA, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12458772">Miranda and Espinosa, 2007</xref>). From these production figures we can deduce that it is the medium-sized, large, and capitalist producers who lose, since they are the ones who mainly take part in the market as sellers of corn, while the sub-subsistence producers, who constitute the immense majority of producers, cannot produce even enough for their own consumption. It is the sub-subsistence producers who have been converted into buyers of corn and might theoretically be the ones to benefit from a decline in relative prices, but the majority of them appear in the market as buyers of tortillas or corn flour and not of corn and therefore are affected as consumers by having to pay relatively high prices for tortillas. Another seriously affected sector is the urban and rural poor, given that the increase in the minimum wage has been less than half of the price increase in tortillas and, in relative terms, the increase in the minimum wage has been less than inflation and even less in relation to the minimum price of tortillas.</p>
<p>In whose hands, then, is the value added in the production of tortillas concentrated? It is the producers of corn flour and tortillas who gain and the consumers of tortillas, especially the urban poor and the former farmers who have abandoned corn production and entered the market as buyers, who lose. The increase in the price of corn in recent years has been a product of dependence on corn from the United States, but that increase has been less than the increase in the price of corn flour. Its producers, being oligopolies, benefit from a noncompetitive market, while the tortilla makers transfer their costs not only of flour but of other ingredients as well to the consumer.</p>
<p>Thus the liberalization of the trade in corn in the context of NAFTA has exacerbated poverty and inequality among the urban poor and in the indigenous communities of Chiapas.</p>

<title>Tortillas and Giffen Goods</title>
<p>In 1890 Alfred Marshall observed a common behavior in society that he called the <italic>law of demand</italic>, an inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of it demanded. However in 1895, Robert Giffen<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0094582X12458772">9</xref></sup> announced a possible exception to this law: faced with an increase in the price of a certain good, people increase their consumption of that good. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X12458772">Jensen and Miller (2002)</xref>, studying the consumption of rice and spaghetti in regions of China where poor families overwhelmingly consume a particular low-cost product of high caloric content, provide empirical evidence of Giffen behavior. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0094582X12458772">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using data from the National Income and Household Spending Survey in Mexico, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12458772">Mckenzie (2002)</xref> asserts that there is no evidence of Giffen behavior in the case of tortillas. He considers tortillas an inferior good (one for which demand increases as income decreases) but not a Giffen good and argues that “Mexican consumers may have a wider array of substitutes available than do Chinese consumers, so that tortillas do not play quite the same role as rice does in China” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12458772">2002</xref>: 17). Considering that the price effect can be subdivided into a substitution effect and an income effect and assuming that the tortilla is (as the author argues) an inferior good, this conclusion implies that an increase in the price of tortillas would produce a substitution effect greater in absolute values than the income effect. We intend to consider here whether there is evidence of Giffen behavior among Mexico’s urban poor.</p>
<p>We begin with the previously mentioned assumption that if the price of tortillas, a basic food, increases, poor consumers cannot switch to an alternative: since tortillas are a cultural good, they tend to increase their consumption of them. Undoubtedly, the price increase reduces the household’s buying power when there is no increase in income to compensate for it. If the income effect is weaker than the substitution effect, the traditional law of demand remains valid: the price of the product goes up and the demand for it declines. The Giffen paradox appears when the income effect is countered by the substitution effect that occurs with inferior goods and in absolute terms is greater: in this case the product’s price increases and so does the demand for it. Goods that show this type of demand curve constitute a subgroup of inferior or poverty goods; Giffen goods are necessarily inferior, but not all inferior goods are Giffen goods.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is that among the poorest sectors, the tortilla is a Giffen good. In contrast to the consumption of beef, milk, fruit, or beer, which increases as the family’s income increases and decreases when its income declines, the consumption of tortillas decreases in favor of other goods as the family’s income increases and increases as it declines. It could be said, then, that the tortilla becomes a kind of “famine food.” For example, for a family made up of a father, a mother, and three small children in which the head of household, who earns US$200 per month working at unskilled jobs, is the only one bringing in money, the consumption of tortillas and beans will be high because their nutrition basically depends on those products. Each month this household consumes 30 kilos of tortillas, 25 kilos of beans, and 3 kilos of beef. Let us now suppose that the household head finds a well-paid permanent job and is earning a salary of US$500 per month plus US$100 that he continues to earn from a weekend job. The household’s income is now US$600 per month and its consumption pattern changes: it begins to consume 5 kilos of beef, 50 eggs, and 5 kilos of sweet bread per month, and its consumption of tortillas and beans declines to 25 kilos of tortillas and 20 kilos of beans. While its income is three times greater, its consumption of beans is reduced by 20 percent and that of tortillas by 16.7 percent. In microeconomic language, tortillas and beans are inferior goods.</p>
<p>Where income is precarious, an increase in the price of tortillas of 42 percent (from 60 cents to 85 cents per kilo), in the framework suggested by Giffen, would cause the family to eliminate the consumption of beef and buy more tortillas and beans. The end result is a negation of the law of demand. In more technical language, we can say that if the price of tortillas and beans increases, their consumption should diminish because of the substitution effect but it increases because of the income effect. When the price of a product increases, the consumer looks for a substitute, and this tendency should have no exceptions. However, there is no substitution effect in the case of tortilla consumption among the poor because for cultural reasons they cannot conceive of the consumption of an alternative to the tortilla such as white bread.</p>

<title>Popular Responses to the Increase in the Price of Tortillas</title>
<p>To examine responses to the increase in the price of tortillas, we conducted a study of 150 socially differentiated households in the city of San Cristóbal de Las Casas, Chiapas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0094582X12458772">11</xref></sup> On the basis of an analysis of social indicators in basic geo-statistical areas from the National Institute of Geography and Statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X12458772">INEGI, 2005</xref>), we selected two neighborhoods with low welfare indices and two upper-class subdivisions. Of the total of number of questionnaires, 100 came from households in the marginal urban neighborhoods of Plan de Ayala and Primero de Enero and the rest from households in two of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city, Bismark and Villa Mayor. The indigenous Tzeltal and Tzotzil people of the former two neighborhoods owe their residence in the city to immigration, especially since the political events of 1994, while the residents of the latter two mainly originated there. The questionnaire dealt with housing conditions, the socio-demographic characteristics of the family, and the family’s behavior in the face of the price increase.</p>
<sec id="section5-0094582X12458772">
<title>Socio-Demographic Differentiation</title>
<p>Despite the obviousness of the social inequality of the two populations under study, we will mention some indicators of social differentiation to establish a context for the results relating to tortilla consumption. In the first place, 86 percent of the wealthy families had incomes of more than 10,000 pesos per month and the remaining 14 percent incomes of between 5,000 and 10,000 pesos. In this group all of the households reported having all the domestic electrical appliances that any household of the middle class and above could possess (computer, heater, refrigerator, washer, blender, television, radio, stereo, video player, etc.). The households of the two marginal urban neighborhoods varied more in income, with 31 percent having incomes between 500 and 1,000 pesos per month, 43 percent incomes between 1,001 and 2,500 pesos per month, and 26 percent incomes between 2,501 and 5,000 pesos per month. Those with incomes between 500 and 1,000 pesos per month had no electrical appliances and therefore no way of conserving food, much less any device for entertainment and distraction. The most telling indicator of socioeconomic level is ownership of cars; households in the two lowest income groups (500–1,000 and 1,001–5,000 pesos per month) had no vehicles while all the households in the top two income groups (5,001–10,000 and 10,001 and more pesos per month) had at least one. These indicators allow us to divide the populations under study into three social classes: those living in extreme poverty (500–1,000 pesos per month), those living in ordinary poverty (1,001–5,000 pesos per month), and the middle-to-upper-class (5,001 pesos per month and above).</p>
<p>With respect to family size, the range was between three and five members per family for the majority of the households. Larger households (6 or more) were concentrated in the groups with incomes of 500–1,000 pesos per month (25 percent) and 1,000–2,500 pesos per month (41 percent); for the middle-to-upper-class large family size declined to 2.6 percent for the income range of 5,000 to 10,000 pesos per month and 0 in the highest range.</p>
<p>Within the extreme-poverty group, 80.6 percent responded that they ate once a day, 9.6 percent that they ate twice a day, and 9.6 percent that they ate three times a day, while the middle-to-upper-class said that they ate three meals daily (Table 1). Whereas for the extreme-poverty group tortillas and beans accompanied only by chiles and salt were the only means of nutrition, for the ordinary-poverty groups these foods were sometimes supplemented by small portions of beef, vegetables, and eggs. In contrast, for the middle-to-upper-class tortillas and beans, rather than being the basis of a meal, were supplemental to beef, eggs, sausages, dairy products, bread, pasta, vegetables, cereals, and fruit. The consumption of tortillas and beans, although general, played different roles with differences in household income. Thus tortillas and beans, as the two products most consumed in the country, constitute the cement of the culture but at the same time divide Mexican society.</p>

<title>Tortilla Consumption in Times of Price Increases</title>
<p>The number of tortillas that a household consumed before the price increase varied with household income. To avoid distortion, we divided the reported tortilla purchases in kilos by the number of household members and compared these figures across income groups. The results (Table 2) indicate that before the price increase per capita consumption in the extreme-poverty group was 400–800 grams for 56.2 percent of households and 801–1,500 grams for 12.5 percent, which together reveal high consumption of tortillas in this group. In the ordinary-poverty groups, 45.1 percent of households with incomes of 1,000–2,500 pesos per month reported per capita tortilla consumption of 401–800 grams, 29.1 percent consumption of 301–400 grams, and 25.8 percent consumption of 201–300 grams. Households with incomes of 2,501–5,000 pesos per month were almost equally distributed between 201–300 grams (20.8 percent), 301–400 grams (33.3 percent), and 401–800 grams (33.3 percent). There appears to be no clear pattern of tortilla consumption for this group. The two wealthier income groups showed quite similar behavior. In the first group, with incomes between 5,000 and 10,000 pesos per month, 61.1 percent of households reported per capita tortilla consumption of 125–200 grams, while the remaining 38.9 percent were distributed between 201–300 grams and 301–400 grams. For the highest income group, 71.4 percent of households fell into the first consumption range, 28.6 percent into the second, and the remaining 14.3 percent into the third. These results show a tendency toward greater tortilla consumption on the part of the poorer households.</p>
<p>After the increase in the price of tortillas, the percentage of households in the extreme-poverty group with per capita consumption of 401–800 grams increased from 56.2 to 81.2 percent. In the following group, the number of households reporting per capita consumption of 401–800 grams similarly increased, from 45.1 to 57 percent. In both of these groups respondents mentioned that they were giving up other foods that they sometimes consumed, such as vegetables, eggs, pasta, and cookies.In the following income group (2,501–5,000 pesos per month), households reporting the second consumption range (201–300 grams) disappeared and were added about equally to the second and the third. This group reported continuing to consume additional foods, suggesting that it is in the ordinary-poverty group that we might find a real increase in the family food budget. Finally, regarding the two highest income groups, households in the first tended to maintain their level of tortilla consumption, while in the second group 85.7 percent instead of the former 71.4 percent fell into the lowest consumption range.</p>

<title>Evaluation of Results</title>
<p>From the available information we can draw four main conclusions:</p>
<list id="list1-0094582X12458772" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>With regard to tortilla consumption before the increase in price, under conditions of extreme poverty per capita consumption of tortillas was considerable, and with a small increase in household income it tended to decline in favor of the consumption of other products. In the case of the wealthy sector, tortilla consumption was complementary to that of a diversity of other products, but it is worth mentioning that there was no household that did not consume tortillas.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With an increase in the price of tortillas, there was a tendency on the lowest rung of society to increase the consumption of tortillas considerably and omit complementary products; the family budget was geared toward increasing consumption of the product that was culturally more accessible, which continued to be tortillas, and dropping other products whose cost was impossible to cover. This is why there was a 25 percent increase in the proportion of households that increased their consumption of tortillas in this group while in the following group (1,001–2,500 pesos per month) the proportion increased by 11.9 percent and in the next (2,500–5,000) by 11.2 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0094582X12458772">12</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At the same time, some groups, although still poor, enjoyed slightly more income and could support the increase in the price of tortillas without reducing the consumption of complementary products; these groups, faced with an increase in the price of tortillas, were burdened with greater expenditure to maintain their food consumption profile.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the case of the middle-to-upper-class, the tortilla’s complementary character meant that its consumption remained almost the same with an increase in price. Curiously, in both groups in this class there was a tendency for the consumption of tortillas to decrease slightly. We might hypothesize that these groups were maintaining the same quota of spending when buying tortillas without being concerned that the quantity was proportionally less.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In summary, the increase in the price of tortillas has meant not only a redistribution of income in favor of the intermediaries who benefit from an oligopolical market but also a consistent loss of buying power for poor households that is accentuated by Giffen behavior. In other words, because of the absence of cultural substitutes for tortillas, the income effect that is typical of inferior goods determines, in the case of the poorer urban population, an increase in tortilla consumption as a consequence of the increase in price.</p>

<title>Final Considerations</title>
<p>With the implementation of NAFTA, Mexico’s agricultural sector has had to confront competition from producers from the North under conditions of technological inferiority and relatively low levels of production. This has been very evident in corn production, with increasing imports from the United States and domestic production that has remained stalled. In addition, variations in the price of this grain have had a series of significant repercussions. For example, we have seen variation in relative price in tortilla production involving a transfer from corn producers to corn flour producers and from the latter to tortilla sellers, accentuating accumulation for the flour producers, who gain from the favorable evolution of prices. On average, in 1973 a minimum wage would buy 28 kilos of tortillas, in 2000 only 9, and in 2007 only 5.7.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0094582X12458772">13</xref></sup> This offers us a measure of the real deterioration of wages, which is even greater if we take into account that the poor devote a significant part of their wages to tortilla consumption. Whereas the increase in the price of tortillas hurts consumers in general, those who are hurt most are the urban extremely poor, whose consumption increases when the price increases given that tortillas are a Giffen good.</p>
<p>The increase in international corn prices as the product-base for the growing use of bio-fuels, especially by the main producer and international exporter of that product, the United States, has been used to justify the increase in the price of tortillas without recognizing that that increase is really being transferred directly to the final consumers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0094582X12458772">14</xref></sup> Given the fragmentation of producers and consumers, it is difficult to exercise any market power, because those who carry the price differential are the corn paste sellers (Maseca, Minsa, and Cargill), who have an oligopolical market and manipulate prices to their advantage. One would suppose that the so-called tortilla manufacturers would benefit from the price differential, but as the number of tortilla makers almost doubled (from 35,000 in 1999 to 65,000 in 2007) with deregulation their incomes declined because consumption did not increase to the same degree.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0094582X12458772">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, tortilla makers may have only a single establishment, and none of them have the capacity to affect the market on their own, making this a market that approaches perfect competition. In the case of the corn flour producers, the situation is different, since their small number makes it easier for them to reach agreement and set prices in addition to controlling the sale of corn and imports.</p>
<p>International corn price increases have benefited producers as corn imports have become more expensive in what may well be functioning as a barrier against the commercial liberalization agreed to on January 1, 2008. However, despite the recent price increase, corn continues to be imported, revealing that it is even cheaper than that produced in Mexico.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated that the increase in the price of tortillas very much exceeds the increase in corn prices and the increase in the minimum wage received by those who consume them. We have also pointed out that the poorest of the urban population, faced with the price increase, take refuge in the consumption of tortillas and discontinue the consumption of other goods, which leads to the conclusion that tortillas represent a Giffen good. Because evidence of this type of good in the world is scarce, this is an important finding.</p>
<p>In summary, we can say that the inflation of prices of corn and tortillas amounts to a price transfer from the poorest to the wealthy and from agriculture to industry and that part of the value added is derived from the benefits of the agro-industrial process through the price differentials of the corn-flour-to-corn-tortilla chain. In the context of this price policy, it is poor urban families who become the unprotected sector, because in order to maintain their consumption of tortillas some eliminate other products and others increase their household spending to maintain their sociocultural reproduction. Thus we have confirmed that tortillas will continue to be a product of organic and cultural nutrition, since, in the face of price increases, consumption of them, far from decreasing, increases, and with it the endorsement of its symbolic power in the national identity.</p>
