<abstract>
<p>In irregular, isotropic surface patterns with randomly distributed roughness elements, the kinetic coefficient of friction is expected to be independent of sliding direction. In regular, anisotropic surface patterns, at least two directions are expected to have different friction coefficients. Five different tackified rugby ball surfaces with different pimple heights and densities were tested; three with irregular (two directions at right angles tested) and two with regular patterns (four directions at 45° angles tested). The friction coefficient and the surface height profile were obtained in a standardised way with the Kawabata friction testing equipment. The average friction coefficients found ranged from 0.94 to 1.25. In the irregular patterns, only one exhibited a significant difference between the two perpendicular directions. In one regular surface, the difference between friction coefficients in two main directions was unexpectedly significant, in the other regular surface, an expected difference in friction coefficient turned out to be non-significant. The coefficient of friction correlated highly with roughness parameters, positively with the arithmetic mean roughness and the average slope of the roughness elements, and negatively with the kurtosis. About 18.3% of the coefficient of friction is accounted for uniquely by the arithmetic mean roughness, 46.1% by a combined contribution of the arithmetic mean roughness and the kurtosis and 0% by unique contribution of the kurtosis.</p>

<p>The roughness geometry of solid surfaces usually originates from machining and/or wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650112439163">1</xref></sup> An anisotropic geometrical surface structure is a structure in which the heights and hollows in the surface are clearly oriented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650112439163">1</xref></sup> The isotropic surface structure consists of a system of asperities without any specified orientation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650112439163">1</xref></sup> Dry friction, which depends on the direction of sliding as a result of roughness anisotropy of the contacting surfaces, is referred to as anisotropic friction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112439163">2</xref></sup> or directional friction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112439163">3</xref></sup> Typical examples of anisotropic friction occur on surfaces with wedge asperities with unequal gradients on either side of the wedge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112439163">2</xref></sup> or on snake skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112439163">3</xref></sup> In sport balls with rough surfaces, the directional friction depends on the surface pattern and geometry.</p>
<p>In games that use pressurised sport balls, the precision of catching and throwing and ultimately the speed of the game is inherently related to the grip of the ball: the better the grip, the higher the precision. The grip can be improved either by tackification of the surface or by using gloves. Tackification of the surface is achieved by introducing rough, pimpled surfaces in rugby balls, American footballs and basketballs, as well as in some handballs; rough, ridged surfaces in high quality water polo balls; and the use of resin in handballs. Australian football league balls and most volleyballs have a smooth surface. Some volleyballs come with a structured surface, e.g. with honeycomb ridges/hexagonal dimples or small circular dimples primarily designed for improved aerodynamics.</p>
<p>Presence of ridges or grooves results in vast directional differences of the coefficients of friction along and across the ridges. The grip will be uneven in different directions which will lead to unstable results. These directional differences can be mitigated by aligning the ridges or grooves in two directions, from which dimpled (interrupted grooves and continuous ridges) or pimpled (interrupted ridges and continuous grooves) surfaces result. Preference is given to pimpled surfaces such as knurled handles of tools, anti-slip floor surfaces and car tyres. This is due to not only better fluid drainage properties, but also a softer surface that is easier to be indented by harder pimples than a softer surface protruding into dimples, which becomes clear from surface pressure concentration and distribution.</p>
<p>Friction of elastomers depends on the deformation of the elastomeric surface, on the adhesion and interaction between the two surfaces, on the normal force, on the sliding speed and on the temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650112439163">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650112439163">10</xref></sup> Elleuch et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650112439163">11</xref></sup> investigated the frictional behaviour of rough elastomers (three different arithmetic mean roughness <italic>Ra</italic>: 13.2, 6.6 and 3.2 mm; two normal forces: 20 and 40 mN; sliding speed ¼ mm/s; three steel indenter diameters: 4, 5.5 and 9.5 mm). The coefficient of friction (COF) increased with decreasing arithmetic mean roughness due to increasing contact area. The COF also increased with the diameter of the indenter, causing a larger contact area. However, the COF decreased with increasing normal force despite the larger area caused by higher load. This shows that the increase in contact area due to normal force in this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650112439163">11</xref></sup> was smaller than the one due to decrease in <italic>Ra</italic>. The same observation – increasing COF with decreasing <italic>Ra</italic> as a consequence of increasing contact area – was made by Skedung et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650112439163">12</xref></sup> and Hendriks and Franklin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350650112439163">13</xref></sup> with skin against hard and rough surfaces. According to Briggs and Briscoe,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350650112439163">14</xref></sup> the friction force is relatively unchanged by the surface roughness.</p>
<p>For surfaces with triangular ridges, Tomlinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650112439163">10</xref></sup> found that the COF remained relatively stable rather than decreasing at smaller <italic>Ra</italic>, and increased with <italic>Ra</italic> at higher <italic>Ra</italic> values. This behaviour was interpreted as interlocking of the ridges on the finger pad with the roughness profile,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650112439163">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112439163">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650112439163">16</xref></sup> which initiates at relatively low <italic>Ra</italic> and then propagates with increasing <italic>Ra</italic>. The interlocking friction coefficient COF<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> equals
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1350650112439163"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650112439163-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>F<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>N</italic> are interlocking friction and normal forces, respectively, and <italic>θ</italic> the angle between slope of a roughness element and the vertical.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112439163">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The total friction force is the sum of adhesive, hysteresis and interlocking friction.</p>
<p>Rugby is played in two different forms: rugby league and rugby union football. The main differences between the two forms are that league football has fewer, clearer and simpler rules, and the game is faster with fewer interruptions, which makes it more interesting for spectators but also more athletically demanding for players. The number of players is different as well, with 13 in league football, and 15 in union football. According to the rules of rugby, the material of rugby balls is regulated:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112439163">17</xref></sup> ‘Leather or suitable synthetic material. It may be treated to make it water resistant and easier to grip’.</p>
<p>The friction between finger skin and rugby ball surfaces was investigated for the first time by Tomlinson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112439163">18</xref></sup> and Tomlinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112439163">19</xref></sup> They analysed four different surfaces with irregular pimple patterns. The pimples were shaped like hemispheres, pyramids or truncated pyramids, where one of the patterns consisted of both smaller and larger pimples. In dry conditions, the kinetic coefficient of friction, COF or <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic>, ranged from 1.1 to 1.6, with pyramidal pimples outperforming the hemispherical ones independent of the number of pimples per unit area. Tomlinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112439163">19</xref></sup> tested the surfaces at a normal force of 12 ± 2.5 N and a sliding speed of 14 ± 6 mm/s.</p>
<p>In this study, Tomlinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112439163">19</xref></sup> did neither determine the pimple density and the surface roughness parameters, nor did they correlate the COF to the surface roughness. They did, however, report the number of pimples per total area, as well as the geometrical dimensions of the dimples (height and diameter). As the pimple patterns investigated were irregular, it is not expected that the COF changes with direction. In structured, regular surface patterns, however, the COF is likely to change with direction. In order to assess the directional differences in COF, a standardised objective test method is required instead of relying on several volunteers (possibly with varying finger skin properties) and a slightly varying normal force and sliding speed applied to the surface. The COF in pimpled rubber surfaces behaves non-linearly and depends on sliding speed and normal force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112439163">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>A standardised method based on finger skin friction seems impossible due to several aforementioned variables. Equally, any standardised method for determining the COF not using finger skin seems inappropriate due to not matching material. Yet, a compromise is offered by the Kawabata KES_FB4 friction tester (by Kato Tech Co. Ltd, Kyoto, Japan), used for quantification of the friction of fabrics (against ‘skin’) and of the comfort and feel when wearing a fabric. The friction probe of the KES_FB4 testing machine is specifically designed for evaluating the friction between fabrics and a mock ‘finger surface’, built with 10 steel wires, 5 mm long and 0.5 mm in diameter, arranged in series with respect to the sliding direction, which simulates the friction ridges on the finger skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650112439163">21</xref></sup> The friction probe is described as ‘used to reproduce the friction of a finger touch on a fabric’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650112439163">22</xref></sup> and ‘simulating finger tips’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350650112439163">23</xref></sup> In addition to the friction probe, the KES_FB4 tester simultaneously measures the surface roughness, however, not on the same spot as the friction is assessed. The roughness probe consists of a single steel wire (5 mm long and 0.5 mm in diameter). The weight of the friction probe is 0.5 N, and the one of the roughness probe is 0.1 N. The sliding speed is 1 mm/s.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to test rugby ball surfaces with different pimple patterns as to sliding direction-dependent differences in the coefficient of friction and to correlate the coefficient of friction with roughness parameters.</p>

<p>We tested five different pimpled surfaces (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350650112439163">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112439163">Figure 1</xref>) and one smooth surface made of exactly the same rubber compound and produced with the same manufacturing process in the same factory. The surfaces were provided by Gray-Nicolls/Steeden. Three of the five surfaces were covered with irregular patterns. Three irregular patterns are available in commercial balls (national rugby league, rugby union, Japanese rugby balls). The two regular patterns were experimental. All surfaces were magnified 15 times with CAM DIG Microscope QC3247 (by Digitech Computer, Briarcliff Manor, NY, USA) and a digital photo (72 ppi) of each surface was taken. A plastic ruler with a 0.5-mm scale was attached to the surfaces for calibration. On the magnified images, the pimple diameters were measured and the pimple density was determined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350650112439163">Table 1</xref>).

</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1350650112439163"><title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>If a surface pattern is apparently irregular, then the hypothesis is that the COFs and roughness parameters measured in two perpendicular directions on the surface are expected to be identical. In order to prove or reject this hypothesis, COFs and roughness parameters were measured in two directions in irregular surface patterns. The reason for this is that the surface roughness, seen in side view perpendicularly to the sliding direction, is the same in any direction over a longer sliding distance (depending on the pimple diameter).</p>
<p>If a surface pattern is regular, then, at least in two main directions, the COFs and roughness parameters are hypothetically expected to be different. In an orthogonal pattern, the two main directions with different COFs are at an angle of 45°, whereas perpendicular directions are expected to have the same COF. The reason for this is explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112439163">Figure 2</xref>, showing how the surface roughness changes when rotating the direction by 45°.
<fig id="fig2-1350650112439163" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Different surface profiles of directions A and D of the regular (REG) surface pattern.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650112439163-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1350650112439163"><title>Directions tested</title>
<p>In the three irregular patterns (FIJ, UCO and NRL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112439163">Figure 1</xref>(a) to (c)), two directions were measured (friction and roughness), i.e. directions ‘1’ and ‘2’, where ‘2’ denotes a direction perpendicular to ‘1’.</p>
<p>In the regular pattern (REG), four directions were measured: A1, A2, D1 and D2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112439163">Figure 1(e)</xref>). Direction A followed the parallel rows of pimples. Direction D (diagonal) was at a 45° angle to direction A. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112439163">Figure 2</xref>, directions A and D are expected to exhibit different COFs. However, in two directions perpendicular to each other, i.e. A1 and A2 or D1 and D2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112439163">Figure 1(e)</xref>), no difference is hypothetically expected.</p>
<p>The hexagonal snowflake (SNO) pattern has theoretically six main directions. However, as the hexagonal pattern is non-equiangular, the number of main directions reduces to four, as directions B and C were coincidentally perpendicular. In an equiangular pattern, the directions B and C would be at a 60° angle. Thus, only four directions were measured: A, B, C and E, where A and E are perpendicular as well, however, due to different geometries, unequal COF is expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112439163">Figure 1(d)</xref>). If the COFs were expectedly equal, then the directions would be A1 and A2.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1350650112439163"><title>Friction and surface roughness testing</title>
<p>Friction coefficient and roughness height were determined with the Kawabata KES_FB4 test machine (by Kato Tech Co. Ltd, Kyoto, Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350650112439163">24</xref></sup>). Each test consisted of forward and backward slidings on the same area, and friction coefficient and roughness height were measured every 100 µm of sliding. The resolution of roughness height measurement was 10 µm. Each test, after removing the initial, middle (reversal of direction) and final parts of the raw data, resulted in 450 raw data on average. The data removal is implemented in the software of the KES_FB4 test machine and is confined to regions where the transition from static to kinetic friction coefficient occurs. Each direction was measured six times in forward and backward directions (2700 raw data on average).</p>

<p>In irregular surface patterns with randomly distributed roughness elements and direction-independent geometry, the kinetic coefficient of friction is expected to be independent of sliding direction. However, a statistically significant difference in COF between directions ‘1’ and ‘2’ of the irregular NRL was found. Minimum and maximum average COFs of the six spots of NRL1 were 1.13 and 1.16, and of NRL2 were 1.04–1.09. Thus, the average COF data of NRL1 and NRL2 are not overlapping and rather separated by a gap from COF 1.09 to 1.13. However, there is no null-based statistical evidence that this behaviour is due to the pimple geometry as the roughness parameters <italic>Ra</italic>, <italic>Rsq</italic> and <italic>Rku</italic> show no statistically significant difference between NRL1 and NRL2. Nevertheless, from magnitude-based statistics, the general trend remains the same: the higher <italic>Ra</italic>, the larger is the COF.</p>
<p>In regular surface patterns, at least two directions are expected to have different friction coefficients, as the pimple geometry changes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112439163">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112439163">2</xref>). In one regular surface, the difference between friction coefficients in two main directions was unexpectedly significant (REG_A1 and REG_A2), in the other regular surface, an expected difference in friction coefficient turned out to be non-significant (SNO_A and SNO_C). The unexpectedly significant difference between REG_A1 and REG_A2 could be attributed to the significant difference in <italic>Rku</italic>. Despite a striking difference in <italic>Ra</italic> and <italic>Rku</italic>, the COF of SNO_A and SNO_C are not different from each other.</p>
<p>The COF correlates with <italic>Ra</italic>, <italic>Rku</italic> and cot <italic>θ</italic>; cot <italic>θ</italic> in turn correlates with <italic>Ra</italic> and <italic>Rku</italic>. From the coefficient of determination, cot <italic>θ</italic> contributes most to the COF. According to equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1350650112439163">1</xref>), the interlocking COF, one of the three components of the overall COF, equals cot <italic>θ</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112439163">15</xref></sup> The interlocking friction force is produced by the interaction of the pimpled surface and the surface of the friction probe, consisting of steel cylinders (0.5 mm in diameter), arranged in series. The adhesive friction is dependent on area and normal load. The COF of the smooth surface tested is significantly smaller (by 8%) than the one of the pimpled surface with the highest COF. This indicates that the COF increases with contact area, however, interlocking is more dominant than adhesion.</p>
<p>The COF data obtained by Tomlinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112439163">19</xref></sup> cannot be directly compared to the data of this study, as Tomlinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112439163">19</xref></sup> obtained their data at different normal loads (12 ± 2.5 N) and velocities (14 ± 6 mm/s) compared to the KES_FB4 tester (0.5 N, 1 mm/s). The reason for this is that the COF behaves highly non-linearly.</p>
<p>Fuss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112439163">20</xref></sup> investigated the non-linear friction (velocity and force dependency) between the finger skin and surface REG (direction A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112439163">Figure 1(e)</xref>) at different speeds and normal forces. The COF data obtained at the same speed and load as that of the KES_FB4 friction probe fell between 1.1 and 1.3. The average data of surface REG, direction A, determined with the KES_FB4 friction probe delivered 1.237 ± 0.119. Although the KES_FB4 friction probe consists of steel, and not of finger skin, the data obtained with both methods are in good agreement, which justifies the applicability of the KES_FB4 friction for the assessment of directional friction of rugby ball surfaces.</p>
<p>The directional differences of the COF in rugby ball surfaces are insofar important, as the oval ball is handled in different ways. When catching, the ball can, in the worst case, only slip between the hands in axial direction. When throwing a pass, the ball is accelerated in axial direction (same as deceleration of a caught ball) and at the same time an axial (rifle) spin is applied by the fingers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112439163">19</xref></sup> sliding over the surface perpendicularly to the long axis. It is thus essential that the directions of maximal COF are aligned axially and circumferentially.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1350650112439163" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>As a general trend across the five surfaces tested, the coefficient of friction correlates positively with the arithmetic mean roughness and the average slope of the roughness elements, and negatively with the kurtosis.</p>
<p>Within a surface of irregular pimple pattern, unexpected directional differences in COF between two perpendicular directions can occur.</p>
<p>A surface of regular pimple pattern can show unexpected differences or similarities in COF between main directions.</p>
<p>Unexpected friction behaviour does not always deviate from the general trend, as unexpectedness is null-based and not magnitude-based.</p>
