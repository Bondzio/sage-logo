<abstract>
<p>This article demonstrates first that, in epistemological terms, <italic>Avatar</italic> relies on scientific ‘documents’ to legitimize its radical political–aesthetic fantasy with such anthropological and historical accuracy that it attains documentary status. The author shows that <italic>Avatar</italic> constructs its viewers as both hypothesizers of and experimenters with fact, while simultaneously constituting them as critics of fiction. Secondly, he illustrates how scientific legitimacy in <italic>Avatar</italic> sits in judgment of aesthetic imagination, just as aesthetic imagination sits in judgment of scientific legitimacy. Thirdly, he argues that <italic>Avatar</italic> is a radical, animated spectacle committed to scientific realism while at the same time being an animated spectacle committed to radical political fantasy. Lastly, he demonstrates how the film offers an alternative model for identity formation, based not on the psychoanalytic processes of introjection, but on the quasi-phenomenological processes of projection into a life form that is factually alien to modern Humanism – into a model of social relations that incorporates symbiotic alliances with the non-human, with flora and fauna, with networked ecological systems in which all actants are interdependent, cooperative, co-constitutive and co-creative.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The majority of scholarship to date on James Cameron’s <italic>Avatar</italic> condemns it, while the majority of popular journalism has reviewed it overwhelmingly positively. What then should be made of that divide? Doesn’t it challenge both its film studies and popular interpretations? The critique from the ‘high-art’ perspective, for example, is that it is only more blockbuster rubbish, while challenges to the high–low binary are almost wholly overlooked. The possibility of something in between remains, for scholarship on <italic>Avatar</italic>, a no-go zone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746847712459597">1</xref></sup> Thus, film studies-centric analyses may not be up to meeting the challenges of the aberration that <italic>Avatar</italic> presents. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746847712459597">Simon During (1993</xref>: 8) pointed out as long ago as 1993:<disp-quote>
<p>The US academy, backed by the USA’s military and ideological might, seems to be becoming more and more dominant. In the Anglophone world … theories and sub-disciplinary formations prosper to the degree that they are disseminated from and sanctioned by elite universities. Yet, in those elite universities there are few anti-disciplinary pressures, and the traditional humanities remain strong, still in the business of distributing cultural capital to the most favoured social groups or to individuals given the opportunity to join such groups. So cultural studies has not flourished institutionally in these universities, nor indeed in British or European elite universities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consequently, the Birmingham School or its US outpost, the now defunct History of Consciousness programme<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1746847712459597">2</xref></sup> is today of little relevance in much film studies scholarship, which has, in large part, turned away from theory and towards historical studies. In contrast, Stuart Hall’s commitment to Antonio Gramsci’s twin concepts of the ‘national popular’ and the ‘war of positions’, for example, has little purchase in criticism of Cameron’s film.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1746847712459597">3</xref></sup> Yet, more than any other of late, Cameron’s film is structured, as will be seen, through wars of position (for example, corporations against the nation state, the middle class against the environment) and demands such an approach precisely because of its remarkable mass popular appeal and political impacts. I will demonstrate that Avatar’s central critical strategy relies on its hybridity – on the tensions it constructs between ‘realism’ and ‘fantasy’, the scientific and the aesthetic, and fictional narrative and factual documentary modes. From a point of view that’s a bit awry, I will take a decidedly favourable view of <italic>Avatar.</italic></p>
<p>I say ‘awry’ because the analysis that follows avoids the established theories of film studies in order to raise specifically philosophical issues. Below, I ask questions in the form of if-then propositions. <italic>If</italic>, for example, the categories of ‘truth’ and what is ‘real’, on which realism depends, are assumed/proven to be illusions, <italic>then</italic>, the concept of ‘documentary’ and its claims to veracity must be thrown into radical doubt. To remind film studies oriented readers, then, of the obvious, a <italic>philosophic</italic> approach to film theory aims to challenge its limits. My view is that theories of ‘documentary’ rely on the epistemological fallacious assumptions of ‘naïve realism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1746847712459597">4</xref></sup> As a consequence, I will not engage with the well-known debates about documentary, as a film studies discourse would expect. I’m not interested in the Nichols et al. framework of classifying documentary film in terms of documentary modes or reenactment, for example. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847712459597">Bella Honess Roe (2011</xref>: 223) has commented: ‘to shoehorn the animated documentary into one of Nichols’s modes threatens to limit our understanding of the form’. My aim is to erase boundaries, rather than codify them, in order to account for ‘real’ impacts of ‘fictional’ cultural production.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1746847712459597">5</xref></sup> Indigenous peoples globally have received <italic>Avatar</italic> not just favourably, but as an extraordinary activist manifesto, screened on their behalf, and which from their perspectives represents their political and cultural values and lives with a powerful authenticity.</p>
<p>My article rests on two premises (in the sense of corollaries). The first is that digital production has transformed the cinematic into a new form of audiovisual materiality that requires a political analysis commensurate with the new forms of cinematic subjectivity it produces. It’s fair to say that animation today constitutes a visual vernacular coextensive with the production of most registers of cultural life. One of the consequences of this, and this is my second premise, is that the ‘real’, understood as the state of pure, unmediated nature has been augmented, once again, by an autonomous, fetishized zone of virtual simulation. The ‘real world’ today is experienced first, for most, in some mediated form – televisual, photographic, cinematic, telephonic, and now, simulated. 3D, computational, cinematic virtuality sutures viewers ever more deeply into its imagined worlds not only because of its ghostly objectivity and actions, but because it intensifies the affective and perceptual dimensions of the experience. In today’s post-natural world, ‘nature’ is confined to theme parks like Utah’s Monument Valley, Brazil’s Amazon Jungle or, in less dramatic terms, England’s Lake District, while emotional and phenomenological life of cosmopolitan modernity is determined by an exclusive and technocentric anthropocentrism. Our ‘natural’ world is a thoroughly ‘cultural’ one characterized by the Spectacle, a condition closer to a hallucination or dream, psychological states in which we are alienated from ourselves, than to the vestigial, mystifying universalism of a falsely presumed normative consciousness. Today, the ‘natural’ objects and events that shape the majority of our experiences are digital simulacra, or deeply pre-programmed by their audiovisual codes and modes of address.</p>
<p>This implies that all attempts to understand what is now ‘natural’ for humans means to study the ramifications of their immersion in <italic>almost</italic> purely artifactual worlds. Two terms of particular importance here have been coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746847712459597">Marc Prensky (2001)</xref> to describe this fundamental historical shift: digital natives are those reared in and by the post-natural conditions of humanity, while digital immigrants refer to those born before that shift, but have managed to one degree or another to relocate to a world reinscribed in a code-driven artifactual actuality. The consequences of these two nascent anthropological terms are historically as significant as Marx’s concepts of proletariat and bourgeoisie once were, though inscribed in a new politics of production that is so alien to his that they cannot be easily reconciled. I’ll return to this problem below.</p>
<p>In these cultural milieux, <italic>Avatar</italic>, I will argue, must be seen as a <italic>tour de force</italic>, and for several reasons. First and foremost, because it offers an alternative model for identity formation, based not on the psychoanalytic processes of introjection, but on the quasi-phenomenological processes of projection into a life form that is factually alien to modern Humanism – into a model of social relations that incorporates symbiotic alliances with the non-human, with flora and fauna, with networked ecological systems in which all actants are interdependent, cooperative, co-constitutive and co-creative. <italic>Avatar</italic> offers a vision opposed to a still rampant social and economistic Darwinism, replacing it with an imaginary, yet supremely scientifically legitimized ecological consciousness. Simultaneously, it requires that we face the horribly discomforting fact of our complicity in the continuing global genocide of indigenous peoples (in China, the Americas, India, Brazil, Palestine, and other places) and in the ecocide of nonhuman biological life. It requires alternatively that we imagine cultural values that are eco-centric, not the capitalist-centric values of modernity on which we are so ideologically dependent, and by which our identities have been so profoundly, psychologically formed.</p>
<p>The second reason why <italic>Avatar</italic> must be taken seriously is because, in aesthetic terms, it is a radical, animated spectacle committed to scientific realism, while at the same time an animated spectacle committed to radical political fantasy. Thirdly, because, in epistemological terms, it relies on scientific ‘documents’ to legitimize its radical political–aesthetic fantasy with such anthropological and historical accuracy, it attains, I will argue, a ‘documentary’ status; and fourth, because it constructs its viewers as both hypothesizers of and experimenters with fact, while simultaneously constituting them as critics of fiction. I will show that scientific legitimacy in <italic>Avatar</italic> sits in judgment of aesthetic imagination, just as aesthetic imagination sits in judgment of scientific legitimacy.</p>
<p>Cameron’s film powerfully grapples with the problem of representing truth in our historical moment, of representing what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1746847712459597">Hayden White (1999</xref>: 41) more than two decades ago called the modernist event. For White, the very<disp-quote>
<p>conceptions of both history and realism have changed … because the social order that is the subject of this history has undergone a radical transformation – a change that permitted the crystallization of the totalitarian form that Western society would assume in the twentieth century.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And it is certainly exactly this totalitarian form that <italic>Avatar</italic> confronts, and in its own phantasmagoric terms. What is peculiar to our modernity is that all historical events are only partial objects in that they cannot be known in their entirety with certainty – 9/11, any terrorist act, the existence of WMDs, the analysis behind any piece of legislation, the numbers of unemployed or those killed in war – none of these things can be represented in exhaustive detail that is sufficient to produce certain knowledge. The result is that imagination today, both aesthetic and scientific, is suspended between fact and fiction, the two illusory endpoints of a spectrum of hybrid states of ‘realism’ that lie between them. One implication of this claim is that <italic>all</italic> documents are fictional facts, just as <italic>all</italic> documentary is factual fiction. A second implication is that <italic>no</italic> analytical method can escape this dilemma. In other words, the limitations of these two objects of study require that <italic>any</italic> theory of documentary must account for <italic>both</italic> the scientific and aesthetic legitimizing strategies deployed by <italic>any</italic> cinematic production. This of course is all the more necessary for science fiction film. Only when we are both aesthetic and scientific judges can we be rigorous theorists of what I will call the ‘documentary effect’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847712459597">Figure 1</xref> illustrates how, in White’s view, the concepts of history and realism have been radically transformed. The diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847712459597">Figure 1a</xref>) speaks for itself, except to say that what I’m positing here is that the constructions of ‘real facts’ and ‘fantasy fictions’ are nothing more than thought experiments that never actually exist in a pure state. Any belief in the former leads only to naïve conceptions of realism, while belief in the latter as independent of any realism is similarly naïve. Both are always mediated by combinations of the document effect (factual effects) and the documentary effect (in some fashion narratological). The comparison of images serves to illustrate this conundrum: how are we to distinguish between the ‘scientific’ visualization on the left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847712459597">Figure 1b</xref>), and the ‘aesthetic’ visualization on the right (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847712459597">Figure 1c</xref>), except by assuming respectively a legitimizing scientific visualization, and the view that a film by definition is not real? I present this dilemma diagrammatically and comparatively here as preface to my interpretation of <italic>Avatar</italic> that follows.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1746847712459597">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>In addition to the four points above, I will demonstrate that the structure of <italic>Avatar</italic> aims to short-circuit the established traditions of narrative film and radically establish, anew, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746847712459597">Gilles Deleuze (1995</xref>: 60) has termed cerebral circuits (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1746847712459597">Figure 2</xref>), where ‘cerebral doesn’t mean intellectual’ because ‘the brain’s emotive, impassioned, too’. While such a claim might seem merely ‘illustrative’, it is central to Cameron’s film, and to my article; it signals immediately the challenge to the mind/body dichotomy pursued in some detail below. The image, in light of Deleuze’s comment, asks: where does knowledge lie, what is intelligence, what is emotion and what forms of ‘knowledge’ are recognizable by the West? Matt’s reading of the digital scan of Jake’s brain (‘That's one beautiful brain’) reflects his own emotional response to a ‘scientific datum’, while eliciting an emotional, unscientific response from the scientist because the brain is, indeed, impassioned. Augustine’s surprise at Matt’s admiration (‘Go figure’) is an early foreshadowing of her own transformation from the purely rational and politically compromised scientist to the state of ‘grace’ that she says she would be willing to die for in order to sample. She is indeed representative of her namesake, St Augustine, the first ‘pagan’ philosopher to convert to Christianity and translate Platonic rationalism into ‘Christianity’. But, as we shall see, Cameron has inverted the religious history of the West by elevating the ‘pagan’ over the ‘Christian’.</p>

<title>Inverting anthropocentrism</title>
<p>We can now say that popular animation has made its first inroads into global, specifically activist politics. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746847712459597">Yosefa Loshitzky (2012</xref>: 151) has commented:<disp-quote>
<p>[<italic>Avatar</italic>] does not explicitly analyse social reality and suggest how it might be changed; nor does it seem to serve a particular political agenda. Yet, despite a veneer of super entertainment, the film has provided a fertile ground for multiple and complex political readings.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the following section, I will take issue with her first statement while developing the second, by first challenging some of the central critiques of the veneer, then analysing what lies beneath them. Cameron’s <italic>Avatar</italic> has not only inspired indigenous political movements in Palestine, China and Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746847712459597">Goetzman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746847712459597">Loshitzky, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746847712459597">Macartney, 2010</xref>) but has reset the debates of high vs low popular cultural ‘value’. The demonstration of this claim rests on disposing, at the outset, of the critique that <italic>Avatar</italic> is ethnocentric and racist. This position has been expressed most popularly by David Brooks, the conservative American political pundit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746847712459597">Brooks (2010)</xref> was threatened enough to devote column space in <italic>The New York Times</italic> to condemning what he has perceived as the film’s ‘great white savior’ narrative.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Still, would it be totally annoying to point out that the whole White Messiah fable, especially as Cameron applies it, is kind of offensive?</p>
<p>It rests on the stereotype that white people are rationalist and technocratic while colonial victims are spiritual and athletic. It rests on the assumption that nonwhites need the White Messiah to lead their crusades. It rests on the assumption that illiteracy is the path to grace. It also creates a sort of two-edged cultural imperialism. Natives can either have their history shaped by cruel imperialists or benevolent ones, but either way, they are going to be supporting actors in our journey to self-admiration.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Brooks here seriously misreads <italic>Avatar</italic> in several ways because he is unable to assume the subjective position that Cameron articulates in response to a question put to him by the Mohawk journalist, Kenneth Deer (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746847712459597">Cameron and Deer, 2010</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>It seems every time there is a large movie like such as ‘Dances with Wolves,’ ‘Little Big Man,’ ‘Wind Talkers,’ the hero is always a non-indigenous person that becomes the savior; the same with the Na’vi. Why is that and will there ever be an indigenous hero who saves the indigenous people?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Cameron replies that ‘[<italic>Avatar</italic>] is trying to wake up Caucasian people to see the issues and anybody who’s essentially in the role of being the economic oppressor or invader.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1746847712459597">7</xref></sup> But he fails to give a much stronger answer to Deer, that his film does in fact figure such an indigenous hero. Brooks superimposes the white savior narrative onto what is actually the opposite; <italic>Avatar</italic> figures a <italic>collective indigenous messiah</italic>, whose aim is to save the Occident from itself. I will return to this below. Brooks’s descriptions of the Na’vi are equally deplorable. The Na’vi are anything but ‘illiterate’; they learn English and teach Na’vi to the colonists; nor are they represented primarily as ‘spiritual and athletic’ but as scientifically highly knowledgeable, political and affective. Brooks’s description is a wilful, because so patently wrong, misinterpretation of Cameron’s depiction of Pandora’s indigenous people; his misreading reinscribes them once again in Modernity’s racist narrative that condemns them as, at best, ‘noble savages’. That he unmasks himself as the defender of the film’s central enemy, the rapacious neoconservative alliance between capitalism and militarism, is a sign of just how effective it is, in sociopolitical terms.</p>
<p>Reception has been no better on some leftist fronts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1746847712459597">8</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1746847712459597">Slavoj Žižek (2010)</xref>, writing in the <italic>New Statesman</italic>, concurs with Brooks:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Avatar’</italic>s fidelity to the old formula of creating a couple, its full trust in fantasy, and its story of a white man marrying the aboriginal princess and becoming king, make it ideologically a rather conservative, old-fashioned film.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both critics, however, are trapped on one side of the filmic apparatus; that is, inside what they assume, wrongly, to be the film’s messianic (Brooks) and pyschoanalytic (Žižek) narrative logics. More on this below. Neither has considered the film’s powerful impact on indigenist activists and organizations the world over. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746847712459597">Loshitsky (2012</xref>: 153) has pointed out:<disp-quote>
<p>The adoption of <italic>Avatar</italic> by the Palestinian people as ‘their film’ and its integration into their daily struggle against the occupation is exceptional because very few films in cinema history have played any significant role in the arena of popular politics, let alone that of bottom-up resistance. There is no historical precedent for a film like <italic>Avatar.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both Brooks and Žižek, by limiting their analyses to the symbolic expectations of the Western gaze and its narrative logic, essentially foreclose their interpretations within the very Humanist tradition that Cameron’s film challenges and, as we will see, certainly not through ‘full trust in fantasy’ by a long way, but as a critique and full distrust of it.</p>
<p>What actually occurs in the film is that a ‘collective’ indigenous messiah is substituted for a white one, inverting the entire eschatological structure of the West. The Na’vi, as is common to many indigenous societies, function on the principle of consensus and the group ‘We’, rather than the principle of individualism that is the ground of Western societies. As the shaman, Moad, says to Jake: ‘Learn well, Jake Sully, and <italic>we</italic> will see if your insanity can be cured.’ In other words, <italic>Avatar</italic> subverts by inverting the Enlightenment’s most cherished commodity fetish, anthropocentrism, by which I mean the anthropological turn initiated by Kant in the 18th century when modern subjectivity is formed through application of and Lockean faith in rationality through which ‘man’ takes himself as an object of anthropological study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746847712459597">Michel Foucault (1997</xref>: 314) has pointed out, however, that the Enlightenment and ‘Humanism’ have been and today still are erroneously confused. ‘If the question of man, of the human species, of the humanist’, he asserts, ‘was important through the eighteenth century, this is very rarely, I believe, because the Enlightenment considered itself a humanism.’ He points out that ‘the nineteenth century had a tendency to oppose the two, at least as much as to confuse them.’ (p. 314.) The difference Foucault establishes is particularly relevant to my analysis of <italic>Avatar</italic>. He aligns the Enlightenment with a critique of Humanism, with ‘what is not or is no longer indispensable for the constitution of ourselves as autonomous subjects’. ‘Humanism’, on the other hand, ‘is something entirely different. It is a theme … always tied to value judgments’ (p. 313). <italic>Avatar’s</italic> central thematic concerns exactly this critique of Humanist value judgments, raising questions about just what is and is not indispensable for the constitution of ourselves.</p>
<p>The critical force of Moad’s comment above is reinforced by Etu’can’s comment: ‘This is the first warrior dreamwalker we have seen. We need to learn more about him.’ The comments of these two Na’vi leaders are central to the film’s reversal of the Brooks/Žižek critique; they signify with perfect clarity that the white messiah narrative has been reversed, that the white man is in fact the subject of a Na’vi ‘alienology’ that aims, on the one hand, to cure and, on the other, to learn from him. Cameron has reversed the politics of the Western ethnocentric gaze that Brooks and Žižek so vehemently defend, requiring that viewers must instead assume the perspective of the indigenous gaze of the alien race that assesses the West from the subjective position of the Other. (While the Na’vi are clearly anthropomorphic, they are alien in that they are radically opposed to the anthropology of Humanism.) This is the very function of the ‘avatar vehicle’. Jake’s main role in the film is played as a twice-born, ‘authentic’ Na’vi, and to the extent that he aids their cause, it is not as a white man, but as rigorously educated by them on their terms, in their body, through their cultural practices, and with their weapons (with an AK 47 here and there). It is true that he is not only a Na’vi, that he brings with him some of the DNA and knowledge of white men’s ways, but he adapts his Na’vi knowledges to be able to resist colonial, capitalist and military dominance. He effectively aids the Na’vi to understand the limits of their ability to resist the military–industrial–complex, and by organizing them to resist and ultimately defeat its hegemony, he serves to transition them from their pre-encounter (symbolically pre-modern) traditions so that they can adapt to the colonizing modern world and preserve those traditions in a new, post-encounter form. This gaze reversal is meant to give an unequivocal response to the last question Colonel Quaritch asks Jake-the-Avatar before he tries to kill his human body: ‘Hey Sully, how’s it feel to betray your own race? You think you’re one of them? Time to wake up.’ Thus Quaritch frames, albeit negatively, the very reversal that Brooks and Žižek deny but that Jake affirms with his highly satisfying cat-hiss response. It is, after all, Neytiri who saves Jake from Quaritch, just as Eywa saves the Na’vi and Pandora by mobilizing ‘its’ (hers?) animal army, and ultimately everyone from the human race. It is the Na’vi and the planet itself that are collectively figured as the messiah in <italic>Avatar</italic>.</p>
<p>While Cameron’s critique of anthropocentrism is central to <italic>Avatar</italic>, he goes much further. The first two thirds of the film should be understood as an animated, ethnographic documentary because it is not an overstatement to say that its main aim is pedagogical. Its main subject matter is the transmission of tacit knowledge, a type of ‘know-how’ not obtainable through scientific reason, logic, or abstract forms of epistemology. It is an embodied knowledge disseminated from one practitioner to another through practice, repetition and physical experiment, and not through abstract reasoning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1746847712459597">Figure 3</xref>). Jake’s training is primarily sensory, tactile, auditory, olfactory, appetitive and visual. Throughout, the emphasis is on physical knowledge expressed emotionally as joy, desire, pleasure, suffering and violence. Jake is portrayed as in a constant state of affective amazement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1746847712459597">9</xref></sup> The film is rife with examples, mainly narrativized through Neytiri’s training of Jake in the ways of Na’vi cultural practices of speaking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1746847712459597">Figure 3a</xref> ), hunting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1746847712459597">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1746847712459597">c</xref>), foraging, pathfinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1746847712459597">Figure 3d</xref>), horse riding, and flying with the toruk. Each of these forms of tacit knowledge are emblemized through the act of sehelu, the making of a physical bond between the Na’vi body and other forms of both flora and fauna, again, suggesting a collectivist, intersubjective and interspecies form of ‘intelligence’. All these practices of tacit knowledge are, as will be discussed further below, anthropologically accurate and critically opposed to rationalist knowledge embodied by the triadic mechanistic structures of the military–industrial–scientific complex of the colonists. Our experience as viewers is an intimate encounter with their language, the practices of their physical everyday lives, and with their indigenous cultural life which, as far as I am aware, is the most thorough and authentic such representation in popular film. As Jake-the-Avatar inevitably ‘goes native’, so does the attentive and empathic viewer.</p>

<p>The animated ethnographic form of <italic>Avatar</italic> is reinforced by the figure of (Dr Grace) Augustine, both a biologist and anthropologist, and her team. She, as Norm points out, ‘literally wrote the book on Na’vi ethnobiology’. Once again, Cameron does not shy away from political commentary; he layers the film with direct reference to an important debate among the members of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) who conducted an extensive investigation into the US military’s Human Terrain System (HTS), a program that has ‘embedded’ anthropologists within its military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. HTS ‘seeks to integrate and apply socio-cultural knowledge of the indigenous civilian population to military operations in support of the commander’s objectives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746847712459597">Human Terrain System, nd</xref>). The AAA condemned the HTS program because it broke the ethical codes that govern anthropologists in the field, endangered lives and produced illegitimate research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746847712459597">American Anthropological Association, 2009</xref>). Grace Augustine is such an embedded anthropologist, though one who resists to a degree breaking the AAA’s code of ethics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1746847712459597">10</xref></sup> The following dialogue between Augustine and Selfridge references this conflict directly:</p>
<speech><speaker>Augustine:</speaker>
<p>The last thing I need is another trigger-happy moron out there.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Selfridge:</speaker>
<p>Look, you’re supposed to be winning the hearts and the minds of natives. Isn’t that the whole point of your little puppet show? You look like them and talk like them and they’ll start trusting us? We build them a school, we teach them English, but what, after so many years? Relations with the indigenous are only getting worse.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Augustine:</speaker>
<p>That tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Selfridge:</speaker>
<p>Right. Come here. This is why we’re here. Unobtainium. Because this little grey rock sells for 20 million a kilo. That’s the only reason. It’s what pays for the whole party. It’s what pays for your science. Comprendo? Now those savages are threatening our whole operation. We’re on the brink of war, and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution. So use what you’ve got and get me some results.</p></speech>
<p>Cameron, who takes credit for writing the script, uses this dialogue not only to stress the several anthropological dilemmas, but to satirically/ironically condemn the entire purpose of the ‘mission’ to Pandora, which of course is an impossible one. If failure is inevitable, it’s only because the mission seeks what all such tragic adventures do – the unobtainable – what Žižek might have recognized as the figure of desire.</p>
<p>Similarly, Jake’s hybridized role as quadruple agent – he works simultaneously for the military–industry–science complex (capitalism) and for the Na’vi, each agency representing a form of power in the war of positions – makes him the perfect embedded ‘informant anthropologist’ because his pluri-agent status allows him to provide Quaritch with the ‘intel’ that makes the attack on Home Tree successful. His multiple roles, all anthropological in essence, make possible the destruction of the culture he has been embedded in, precisely because of his hybridity as warrior–scientist, and because he is a fully initiated member of Na’vi society. He was tasked by Quaritch to ‘get to know them’, just as he was tasked by Moad to ‘learn well’ the Na’vi ways. Thus the actual documents and events alluded to throughout the film are at most only very superficially fictionalized, with the result that the historical documents and events are so transparent that a realism that outweighs their fictional character must be attributed to them. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746847712459597">Bakhtin (1986</xref>: 63) has pointed out:<disp-quote>
<p>To ignore the nature of the utterance … leads to perfunctoriness and excessive abstractness, distorts the historicity of the research, and weakens the link between language and life. After all, language enters life through concrete utterances (which manifest language) and life enters language through concrete utterances as well.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The direct allusions to both AAA and HTS documents described above, or to George W Bush’s ‘We will fight terror with terror’, are utterances of this type and are examples, in this case, of filmic appropriation of everyday, nonliterary language absorbed by Cameron’s film and constitute its documentary effect. To be understood properly, <italic>Avatar</italic> must be interpreted against the background of this anthropological critique and critique of anthropology, placing Cameron himself squarely in the camp of activist public intellectuals, precisely because of his quotational strategies that allow language to enter life, and life, language. As we shall see, this occurs equally at the level of imagery.</p>
<p><italic>Avatar’s</italic> intertextual form, then, combines <italic>both</italic> the documentary effects of animated ethnography about indigenous tacit epistemologies <italic>and</italic> the documentary effects of historical reportage of genocide and ecocide at the hands of the ruthless hegemony of global finance capital. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746847712459597">George Monbiot (2010)</xref> rightly commented: ‘Cameron’s blockbuster offers a chilling metaphor for European butchery of the Americas.’ But read at the level of spectator affect and documentary effect, it is not merely a metaphor but, again, as the remarkable response from the World Indigenous Movement has demonstrated, also a <italic>realistic</italic> response to such continuing butchery worldwide, today.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1746847712459597">11</xref></sup> <italic>Avatar</italic> has demonstrated that a blockbuster commercial film can maintain the ‘phantasmagoric form’ of animated fictional-documentary, even when pushed to the extreme, and remaining powerfully factually-fictional in order to optimize its political efficacy by reaching millions of culturally diverse viewers globally.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1746847712459597">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Avatar</italic> does something else quite important: it pits documentary narrative against dramatic narrative, forcing viewers to adapt to two opposing cinematic logics simultaneously. Judged by high art principles of narrative structure, <italic>Avatar</italic> is no doubt simplistic, populated as it is by stereotypical characters – macho military man, brainy, masculinized woman scientist, slightly effeminate, golfing corporate business man, technologically primitive indigenous tribes in sync with an amoral, beautiful and often violent natural world. But the narrative is intentionally cliché, reductive, and must be interpreted as a skeletal structure of secondary importance against which the primary content of the film may be heightened – the affective and the emotional, the anti-rational world of pleasure, desire, fantasy possibilities of embodiment projected into an alien life form and techno-natural social relations. The narratological principle of <italic>Avatar</italic> is that only one who has suffered trauma, as Jake has, can have empathy with the trauma of others. One can overcome trauma only through radical transformation of the cause of the trauma. Jake’s transformation, however, is anything but a retrogressive going backward in Humanist modernity’s terms, to a spatio-temporal state perceived (wrongly) as outside history, static and without future. Rather, it is a transformation of contemporaneous culture (wrongly perceived as obsolete if not dead) as newly modern. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746847712459597">Homi Bhabha (1994</xref>: 7) definitively put it:<disp-quote>
<p>Such art does not merely recall the past as social cause or aesthetic precedent; it renews the past, refiguring it as a contingent ‘in-between’ space, that innovates and interrupts the performance of the present. The ‘past-present’ becomes part of the necessity, not the nostalgia, of living.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The response of indigenist peoples world-wide is surely sufficient to justify attributing this claim to <italic>Avatar</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Avatar</italic> has demonstrated that the connection between its material (social) relations can in fact have quite real and effective political consequences. It has also proved that ‘phantasmagoric form’ is not necessarily a form of ‘false consciousness’, but may become a weapon in the arsenal of radical political change. The following diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1746847712459597">Figure 4</xref>) schematizes the various inversions that <italic>Avatar</italic> structurally and intentionally negotiates.</p>

<p>While this schema of inversions is not entirely unique to Avatar, and could be partially applied to many films of the action genre, it is specifically the elevation of filmic production, its often stunning animation aesthetic (of which its 3D effects are not all that important) over filmic consciousness that sets it apart from any other film. This is, in part, because just below the veneer of the CGI Na’vi bodies lies the actor’s human body whose physical movements have been digitally captured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847712459597">Figure 5b</xref>); that is, essentially transposed through the scanning of not indexical qualities, but of force vectors by which the CGI bodies are made to appear so realistic and convincing. The ‘real’ human body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847712459597">Figure 5a</xref>) is the ‘document’ that gives its fictionalized, animated analogue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847712459597">Figure 5c</xref>) its documentary effect. Similarly, Cameron’s film is unique in its elevation of not just the organic over the mechanical – over both the figure of the cyborg and mechanical cybernetics that predominates in almost all science fiction film – but of the figure of the hybridized avatar body conceived as a synthetic and synthesized vital machine that functions according to the principles of a non-mechanical, purely organic, cybernetic network.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1746847712459597">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>The scientific–aesthetic</title>
<p>The lesson of this political allegory is that, in order to break the hallucination of its literally lethal ethnocentrism, the Occident must comprehend the consequences of its hubristic ignorance of what is other to it, and learn to value both what it does not understand, and even what it <italic>necessarily</italic> misunderstands. The genocidal history of the Occident must be reconstructed to oppose the Judeo-Christian strategies of civilizing difference that it deploys in order to re-produce it in its own, descriptive and self-aggrandizing self-image. The film’s central thesis is that human history and its cultural evolution have reached their anthropocentric, Humanist endgames. But what aesthetic and scientific strategies does Cameron use to demonstrate this thesis? As an entry point to comprehending them, I turn to an oft-cited passage from Marx’s <italic>Capital</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746847712459597">McLellan, 1977</xref>: 436), to avoid a common misunderstanding of his notion of historical materialism. ‘The existence of things’, Marx comments,<disp-quote>
<p>qua commodities, and the value relation between the products of labour which stamps them as commodities, have absolutely no connection with their physical properties and with material relations arising therefrom. There [as relations of value] it is a definite social relation between people, which assumes for them the phantasmagoric form of a relation between things.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Marx here articulates one of the running conundrums of recent film theory – where do technology and the social relations of production begin and end? His position contradicts both materialist and post-media perspectives that have defined much art and film theory, shifting the ground of analysis from material specificity not just to social relations between people, but to phantasmorgoric ones; in other words, to the registers of false consciousness, ideology and the imaginary. In his own words, his position is absolutist – there is ‘absolutely no connection’ – and vehemently opposed to technological determinism. At the moment when the human and other animal genomes have been decoded, and the bioengineer Craig Venter has designed and manufactured a new life form, when the Arctic is now the new global battle zone for oil exploration, Marx’s absolutism itself becomes a spectre beckoning us with the urgency of Hamlet’s father’s ghost, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746847712459597">Derrida (2002)</xref> has eloquently suggested. There is no question that today both ‘life’ and ‘death’ are commodities rapidly metamorphosing into another phantasmagoric form too nascent and primitive to recognize.</p>
<p>How, then, are we to understand today’s social relations as a phantasmagoric form of relation between <italic>things</italic>, when each minute of <italic>Avatar’s</italic> 162 minutes occupies 17.28 gigabytes of storage and required a 10,000 square foot render farm with 4000 servers using one of the most powerful supercomputers in existence and 900 people to produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1746847712459597">Rath, 2009</xref>)? What kind of ‘thing’ is this digital minute? How should we understand the social relations latent in the fantasy of animated military helicopters and flocks of alien blue flamingos? Not only was the labour required to produce <italic>Avatar</italic> prodigious, so has been its impact and, importantly, not just on indigenous groups. Rotten Tomatoes has reported that 83 per cent of 263 professional critics have given it a rating of 7.4 out of 10, while Metacritic and Cinema Score have given it commensurate ratings. It has been called the greatest scifi film since <italic>Star Wars</italic>. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746847712459597">Planetary Society Organization (2010)</xref> has stated: ‘it’s the most science grounded fantasy ever put on the big screen.’ And this assessment is correct. Cameron worked with a linguist to construct the Na’vi language, with an anthropologist expert on Papua New Guinea shamanism on which Na’vi culture is modelled, and with an ethnomusicologist composer to design Na’vi sonic life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746847712459597">Bowes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746847712459597">Horner, nd</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746847712459597">Lutkehaus, 2009</xref>). He has written a field guide that explains the film’s realist conceptions of biology, astronomy, geophysics and social history of Pandora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1746847712459597">Wilhelm and Mathison, 2009</xref>). Even the Hallelujah Mountains and unobtainium are theoretically realistic, based on the physics of superconductors that float in the presence of a magnetic field – in the case of the floating mountains, since they are made of superconducting unobtainium, they float in Pandora’s powerful planetary-scale magnetic field.</p>
<p>This scientific and technological ‘realism’ is, paradoxically, the very ground on which the film’s phantasmagoric form rests. Na’vi size, strength, agility, resilience are believable because their bones are made of ‘naturally occurring carbon fibre’, a concept itself believable because all life we know of is constructed of carbon molecules. The avatar driver modules are convincing because their design intentionally mimics MRI scanners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1746847712459597">14</xref></sup> In general, <italic>Avatar</italic> is believable, compelling and evocative because every 17.28 gigabyte minute so exquisitely crafts a fascinating tension between familiarity and otherness, as in the example above of flesh and blood human body existing literally just below the skin of the CGI Na’vi body. There are few moments, if any, when fantasy is not firmly rooted in scientific realism. The ‘thingness’ of <italic>Avatar</italic> is determined not by any factual ontology, but by an epistemology of fact that determines the film’s aesthetic production. Put otherwise, it is scientific legitimacy that determines the film’s aesthetic imaginary. This scientific–aesthetic establishes a phantasmagoric form of social relations not between things, but between a series of imaginary choices and positions that the film constructs through analogies, thematic rhymes and allusions to history in order to make judges of us. But this judgment is double-edged; scientific legitimacy sits in judgment of aesthetic imagination, as aesthetic imagination gives phantasmagoric form to scientific legitimacy. In the former case, we are positioned as hypothesizers and experimenters; in the latter case, as aesthetic critics. <italic>Avatar</italic> constructs its viewers in the tensions between two positions; first, as problem solvers, and second as judges of ethical dilemmas, political conflicts and psychological traumas produced by the two polar drives, hypothesized by Freud, as Eros and Thanatos, as the engines of civilization and its discontents, that is, the war of positions in <italic>Avatar</italic>, between the Humanist colonizers and the Alien colonized.</p>
<p>If the human body is the ‘factual’ document transposed as digital data into the ethnographic documentary narrative of the Na’vi ‘body’s’ cultural life, and if this constitutes the film’s scientific, anthropological legitimacy, then it is the aesthetic characteristics of the CGI bodily phantasm that legitimizes the ‘authenticity’ of Jake’s subjective triple agency (different from the political, quadruple agency discussed above). Not only is he, agent position one, the human ‘driver’ (Lacanian drive) of the avatar vehicle, agent position two, but he is also able to extend both of these agencies further to become a third, hybridized interspecies agent position through sehelu to share subjectivity with Pandoran fauna (horse and toruk) and flora (Eywa). The film itself allegorizes self-reflexively the embodiment of this deconstructed triple subjectivity through its many manifestations of Jake-becoming-avatar-becoming-animal. What the film viewer witnesses, and may or may not identify with, are the processes – political, psychological, and physical – of the cultural conflicts of ‘going native’, of the transmogrification of Western subjectivity into indigenous, Na’vi subjectivity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1746847712459597">Figure 6</xref> aims to make explicit just what the aesthetic stakes are by superimposing the cultural registers of subjectivity onto the aesthetic, primary conditions of space and time. Once again, we see that it is the agonistic tensions between the positions of the West and alien Other that <italic>Avatar</italic> powerfully depicts. The Western subject is depicted as formed by the ideology of individualism, in which social relations are defined by ‘I’-to-‘I’ relations in a spacetime conceptualized as abstract–mechanical and progressive–linear; while the Na’vi subject is depicted by the ideology of collectivism, in which social relations are defined by ‘I’-to-‘We’ relations in a spacetime conceptualized as coeval, repetitive, static and corporeal–organic. It is in this way that <italic>Avatar</italic> is self-reflexive; the symbolic inversions of anthropocentrism illustrated in the diagram above are projected on the figure of Jake himself. In other words, the structure of the film, and the figuration of its main protagonist, mirror each other in a 1-to-1 correspondence.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1746847712459597-fig6.tif"/></fig>
<p>But the narrative logic of figuration applied to Jake is rigorously maintained throughout the film, and the same analysis applies to the self-reflexivity between all of the positions determined by its cultural registers, and the film’s characters that represent them. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1746847712459597">Figure 7</xref> maps the spacetime agent positionalities by stereotype onto the discourse chains that govern them. But the central column, in bold lettering, is the axis around which all the others revolve, and which determines the Humanist judgment vectors the film forces the viewer to confront. But it also demonstrates that Cameron does indeed provide both ‘a very definite [analysis] of social reality and suggest how it might be changed’; while it also quite definitely ‘serve[s] a particular political agenda’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746847712459597">Loshitzky, 2012</xref>). Again, the film is rife with examples in addition to those discussed so far; Quaritch’s literal ecolalia of George W Bush’s speech – ‘to fight terror with terror’ – to the obvious visual references to the militarized Caterpillar bulldozers used by the Israeli Defence Forces to destroy Palestinian homes and olive orchards, to his quite hard-hitting critique of the alliance of militarism in general to an unrestrained global capitalism. The ‘solution’, it is fair to surmise, lies in demilitarizing the economy and replacing it with a negotiable value system based on ecology for the reciprocal benefits of a consensual society based on ‘we’, not on a rampant libertarian individualism. Okay, so it is also fair to criticize this ‘solution’ as a utopian pipe-dream. At the minimum, however, it is fair to call <italic>Avatar</italic> both a manifesto and a proposal. And the fact that it has had such enormous, on the ground political impact makes it more than simply pure fantasy. His political agenda, ‘to wake up Caucasian people to see the issues and anybody who’s essentially in the role of being the economic oppressor or invader’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1746847712459597">15</xref></sup> has had global success. The clear message of the film is this: only by ‘going native’, by inventing an imagined community in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746847712459597">Benedict Anderson’s (1991)</xref> terms based on ecological ‘values’ in every sense of the term, ‘value’, will such a politics be accomplished. ‘It’s time to wake up’, says Jake (one of three iterations of that phrase in the film) in the aftermath of the destruction of Home Tree, when he realizes the absurdity of his marine training, that warriors can bring peace.</p>

<title>The native messiah</title>
<p>I will conclude by returning to the problem of messianism with which I began in order to demonstrate that it is inseparably linked to the film’s techno-scientific materiality and content as well as to its scientific–aesthetic structure.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have been struggling with this impossible concept, the messianic arrival [<italic>arrivance</italic>], for a long time … The most difficult thing is to justify, at least provisionally, pedagogically, this predicate ‘messianic’; it is a matter of an experience that is a priori messianic, but a priori exposed, in its very expectation, to what will be determined only a posteriori by the event … messianicity without messianism and therefore without doctrine and religious dogma. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746847712459597">Derrida, 2002</xref>: 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Avatar</italic> does take the messiah as one of its primary figures, though in a radically inverse (a priori) form of its Judeo-Christian paradigm, and in a way having no resemblance (a posteriori) to the Brooks/ Žižek negative interpretation discussed above. Derrida here raises the term to the level of a structural concept, as yet another avatar of <italic>differance</italic> (to differ <italic>and</italic> defer simultaneously). Its pedagogical utility, when stripped of religious doctrine and dogma, is that it frames the utopian fantasy as a state of perpetual suspense; messianicity without messianism is an operation akin to drama’s suspended disbelief, to the cinematic demand of <italic>Avatar</italic>, and thus constitutes an inherently critical frame of mind. Because the return of the messiah, the arrival of a Marxist post-class-conflict utopia, for example, is perpetually deferred, it is a fantasy that concretely impacts the historical present as expectation or hope, as a critical frame of reference of the ultimately different, the ‘what might be’. <italic>Avatar</italic> applies the messianic, as we have seen, in a critical and complex way, as negotiated and communitarian. As already mentioned, the film’s anthropological inversion has made Jake the subject of Na’vi alienology – it is they who ultimately do cure his insanity, and this is reinforced forcefully near the end of the film when Neytiri saves Jake from Quaritch’s attack. Cameron, however, inscribes this messianic act in a way that literalizes the inversion of the Judeo-Christian conception as may be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1746847712459597">Figure 8</xref>. The pose here is that of a classical Pietà; however, from the spectator’s point of view, Mary has been replaced by a futuristic, ‘pagan’, female warrior. Further, this Pietà does not represent mother and son, but husband and wife who are ‘seeing’ each other for the first time (waking up) in their own biological frames of reference, their first, and last, Na’vi-to-human encounter. Nor is Jake the dead Jesus, but a disabled marine and initiated member of Na’vi culture. Cameron has refigured the Christian myth with signifiers that overturn the symbolic registers of Western culture, and its Humanist origins. What we have is a powerful, affective, moment of love and recognition between irreconcilable differences, irreconcilable to the degree that they literally cannot breathe the same air.</p>

<p>But also at stake, indissociably, is the differantial deployment of techne, of techno-science or tele-technology. It obliges us more than ever to think the visualization of space and time, the possibility of virtual events whose movement and speed prohibit us more than ever … from opposing presence to its representation, ‘real time’ to ‘deferred time,’ effectivity to its simulacrum, the living to the non-living, in short the living to the living-dead of its ghosts.

</disp-quote></p>
<p>One is tempted to think that Cameron conceptualized both the film and the ‘avatar vehicle’ after reading this passage. The avatar is then far more than a CGI wonder. It is a visualization of the impossibility of setting presence in opposition to representation, of effectivity in opposition to its simulacrum. It is precisely in this sense that <italic>Avatar</italic> is a radical, politically committed animated spectacle about being an animated spectacle about radical political commitment.

In the virtual space of all the tele-technosciences, in the general dis-location to which our time is destined – as are from now on the places of lovers, families, nations – the messianic trembles on the edge of this event itself. It is this hesitation, it has no other vibration, it does not ‘live’ otherwise, but it would no longer be messianic if it stopped hesitating: how to give rise and to give place, still to render it, this place, to render it habitable, but without killing the future in the name of old frontiers? Like those of the blood, nationalisms of native soil not only sow hatred, not only commit crimes, they have no future, they promise nothing even if, like stupidity or the unconscious, they hold fast to life. This messianic hesitation does not paralyze any decision, any affirmation, any responsibility. On the contrary, it grants them their elementary condition. It is their very experience.

<p>Jake-the-Avatar is the precise figure of such messianic hesitation, vacillating, vibrating, as he does between human and alien states, between the political allegiances to his own ‘race’, and to that of the Omaticaya, between those to science, the military and nature. Jake’s passage from defender of neoliberal capitalism to defender of a futuristic ‘otherwise than modernity’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746847712459597">Bhabha (1994</xref>: 6) has put it, to an absolute otherness, to inhabiting the ‘general dis-location to which our time is destined’, is an allegory of embracing the elementary condition of messianic hesitation between states and places. Cameron’s avatar ‘vehicle’ is a remarkably precise rendering of Derrida’s critique of our teletechnoscientific sociopolitical state. It figures not only the refusal of oppositionality between presence and representation, effectivity and simulacra, but between radically different models of sociopolitical states, suggestive of a future with a promise of a democracy-to-come ordered by a type of justice radically different from the Humanism that still, unfortunately, exists today.</p>
<p><italic>Avatar</italic>, then, succeeds, not only in portraying the popular imaginary, but in ‘moving’ it to affective imaginaries that radically condemn representational politics.</p>

<p>Cultural Studies it should be noted, particularly in its North American version, was depoliticized by the 1990s (with some exceptions of course), and led not only to its condemnation by its British cultural studies ancestors, but to a near abandonment of it by the University, and generally by many scholars as a legitimate intellectual endeavour.</p></fn>

<p>History of Consciousness was a PhD program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, founded in the 1960s, and was the leading ‘cultural studies’ program through the early years of this century. It was led by such luminaries as Fredric Jameson, Hayden White, James Clifford, Teresa DeLauretis, Angela Davis and Donna Haraway, and carried on, through a direct alliance, the more Marxist-oriented cultural studies agenda of the Birmingham School. I must mention that this article owes a great deal to James Clifford’s exhaustive seminars in the 1990s on both British Cultural Studies (particularly on Stuart Hall) and Global Indigenism and Diaspora.</p></fn>

<p>This is too complex a territory to encapsulate with a reference or two. Instead, I would point those interested in these debates to Hall’s important essay, ‘Gramsci’s relevance for the study of race and ethnicity’, published originally in <italic>Journal of Communication Inquiry</italic> 1986, 10(2): 5–7. It may also be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746847712459597">Hall (1996)</xref>, where he discusses Gramsci’s terms, national popular and war of positions, among many others. My point is summed up by Hall’s comment:<disp-quote>
<p>It is this concern with structures of popular thought which distinguishes Gramsci’s treatment of ideology. Thus, he insists that everyone is a philosopher or an intellectual in so far as he/she thinks, since all thought, action and language is reflexive, contains a conscious line of moral conduct and thus sustains a particular conception of the world (though not everyone has the specialized function of the intellectual.

<p>Once seen as the structuring philosophical and aesthetic antinomies of film history, the Documentary and Animation genres defined the lines between fact and fiction, indexical traces of the real and hand-made imaginings, truth and fancy, naturalism and expressionism. Such binaries no longer hold the same ontological power they once did for defining cinematic form or the line between the intellectually driven high art of the Cinema and the anarchic lowbrow art of mass entertainment. As epistemological, technological and aesthetic transformations occur throughout our society, the binaries between the truth claims of documentary cinemas and the impressionisms of animated filmmaking seem increasingly irrelevant.</p>

<p>Evocation is a third function of animation in animated documentaries that responds to a different kind of representational limitation.

<p>Cameron attended the Ninth Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues here, along with hundreds of indigenous activists from around the world, 19–30 April 2010. It is particularly apt that he was invited as the Forum’s Special Theme was Indigenous Peoples: Development with Culture and Identity, based on articles 3 and 32 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The UNPFII press release commented:<disp-quote>
<p>The AVATAR movie has been embraced by many indigenous peoples worldwide, who see it as echoing their own story. Throughout Latin America for example, indigenous peoples have highlighted the parallels between the movie and their own experiences dealing with private sector extractive industries and the development of mega projects on their lands.</p>
