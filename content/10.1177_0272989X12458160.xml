<abstract>
<p>Increasingly, decision analytic models are used within economic evaluations of health technologies (e.g., pharmaceuticals) submitted to national reimbursement bodies in countries like Australia and UK, where such models play a fundamental role in informing public funding decisions. Concerns regarding the accuracy of model outputs and hence the credibility of national reimbursement decisions are frequently raised. We propose a framework for developing reference models for specific diseases to inform economic evaluations of health technologies and their appraisal. The structure of a reference model reflects the natural history of the condition under study and defines the clinical events to be represented, the relationships between the events, and the effect of patient characteristics on the probability and timing of events. We contend that the use of reference models will improve the accuracy and comparability of public funding decisions. This can lead to the more efficient allocation of public funds.</p>

<p>Decision analytic models are now an expected part of the economic evaluation of new health technologies such as pharmaceuticals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12458160">1</xref></sup> These models provide a flexible framework for synthesizing data from a variety of sources, for linking intermediate outcomes to final outcomes (e.g., quality-adjusted life years), and for extrapolating beyond the data observed in a clinical trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12458160">2</xref></sup> It is well accepted that decision analytic models play a key role in assessing health technologies with the objective of informing public funding decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12458160">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12458160">4</xref></sup> Most often, national reimbursement bodies such as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) and the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) in Australia and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in UK provide guidance to the government using models that form the basis of decisions concerning public funding of new health technologies (e.g., pharmaceuticals and medical procedures) or altered indications for existing technologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12458160">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12458160">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>These decision-making institutions commission independent academic health technology assessment (HTA) units to 1) conduct systematic review and economic evaluation on appraisal topics and 2) appraise submissions by stakeholders (e.g., industry) to have health technologies considered by NICE, PBAC, or MSAC. The reimbursement institutions have introduced guidelines that acknowledge the need for models in submissions seeking public funding of new health technologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12458160">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12458160">8</xref></sup> However, concerns have been raised repeatedly about the accuracy of model outputs and hence the credibility of reimbursement decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12458160">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>There has been significant debate in the literature about the potential for industry-induced bias in cost-effectiveness analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12458160">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12458160">11</xref></sup> A recently published study investigating the impact of industry sponsorship on the findings of model-based pharmacoeconomic analyses found that about 95% of 138 analyses sponsored by industry had favorable results, compared with only 50% of those without industry sponsorship.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12458160">12</xref></sup> Reviews of submissions to national reimbursement bodies suggest that the cost-effectiveness ratios estimated by industry are significantly lower than the estimates made by HTA units (i.e., in favor of the technology being evaluated).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12458160">13</xref></sup> Thematic analyses of the evaluation of submissions to national reimbursement bodies have identified sources of this discrepancy with a focus on the uncertainty surrounding model outputs that is inherent to any model-based evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X12458160">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X12458160"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X12458160">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The process of developing a model requires 3 key choices to be made regarding 1) model structure and type (e.g., health states included in the model, transitions between them, and the choice of a modeling technique), 2) analytical methods such as the perspective taken (e.g., government, society) and the discount rate assumed, and 3) model input values (e.g., incidence of disease, costs of treatment).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12458160">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12458160"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X12458160">19</xref></sup> The identified choices are all subject to uncertainty and so can be potential sources of manipulation and bias.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to minimize bias in model-based submissions to public funding bodies could be for the reimbursement institutions to use an appropriate and consistent evaluation framework. Consistent with good practice for decision analytic modeling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X12458160">20</xref></sup> recommendations for the choice of analytical methods and model parameterization (values assigned to the model inputs) (i.e., Items 2 and 3 above) are generally well established and continually refined in guidelines developed by national reimbursement bodies (e.g., using probabilistic sensitivity analysis to address parameter uncertainty and using a “reference case” to deal with methodological uncertainty).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12458160">8</xref></sup> Although the choice of health states and events included in the model structure may have a substantial impact on a model’s results, relatively little attention has been paid to address this issue in guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X12458160">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12458160"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X12458160"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X12458160">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The guidelines only provide generic advice regarding the quality of a model structure. For example, PBAC guidance states that the description of the economic evaluation should include “a description of all assumptions made in the construction of the economic evaluation.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12458160">7</xref>,p124</sup> Similarly, NICE guidance states that “all structural assumptions should be fully justified.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12458160">8</xref>,p42</sup></p>
<p>The process of developing an appropriate model structure (i.e., Item 1 above) is not explicitly discussed within the HTA domain, and this issue is rarely recognized or discussed in evaluations of model-based submissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X12458160">25</xref></sup> This paper aims to propose a framework that can be used to develop reference models for specific diseases (e.g., depression) representing the natural history of the condition under study. We contend that the use of reference models within the HTA domain will reduce duplication of effort by modelers, develop a consensus between stakeholders on those factors that underpin an understanding of the place of any new technology in a particular disease area, and increase comparability of analyses (and decision making) within a disease area. This reflects our aim to avoid “reinventing the wheel” and to reduce burden on industry and HTA units in an attempt to move away from the negative discussion about the risk of the potential bias in submissions toward a dialogue with bilateral benefits.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272989X12458160">
<title>Necessity for and Characteristics of Reference Models</title>
<p>Because of the significant role of models in informing policy decisions for new health technologies, several guidelines and reports for good practices in model development processes have been issued. The mission of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR)—Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM) Joint Modeling Good Research Practices Task Force is to provide guidance for improving the quality of model-based studies including the design of modeling studies, conceptualizing the model, selecting appropriate modeling techniques and data sources, addressing uncertainty, and using model-based study results to inform decision-making. The task force reports are in draft form and are available from the ISPOR Web site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12458160">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>As noted by the task force report on the conceptualization of the model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X12458160">27</xref></sup> model structures are infrequently justified in model-based evaluations. This is consistent with the experience of the authors of this paper as evaluators of PBAC submissions. Due to the short period of time over which submissions are appraised, lack of confidence in structure checking processes, or lack of awareness of the necessity for model structure checking, HTA evaluators most often fail to establish the validity of submitted model structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272989X12458160">28</xref></sup> This increases the likelihood of potential bias. For example, Brisson and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272989X12458160">29</xref></sup> showed that by excluding the possible effect of vaccination on zoster virus, the model output assessing varicella vaccination became very attractive from the perspective of the health care provider.</p>
<p>Concerns also arise when alternative submissions to national reimbursement bodies use alternative model structures for the same disease (e.g., to evaluate different pharmaceuticals for treating depression). For a specific disease, diversity in model structure reduces the comparability of evaluations of competing health technologies for the same condition, leading to inconsistent public funding decisions.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, there is a need for a detailed and transparent framework for developing an appropriate common model structure (reference models) for specific diseases (e.g., depression, colorectal cancer, etc.) to inform public funding decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X12458160">30</xref></sup> It should be noted that by developing and using reference models, structural uncertainty cannot be eliminated and approaches to address structural uncertainty might be still required if there is insufficient evidence (or conflicting evidence) to support an appropriate model structure. However, we contend that this approach will improve the accuracy, comparability, and transparency of public funding decisions and reduce potential for manipulation.</p>
<p>The structure of a reference model defines the clinical events to be represented, the relationships between the events, and the effect of patient characteristics on the probability and timing of events. The model should accurately represent both the knowledge and uncertainty about states relating to the disease progression on the basis of the best available evidence. A reference model can be applied to a wide set of interventions for a specific disease (e.g., drugs and procedures that may target alternative mechanisms or stages of disease). For example, a reference model for depression could be used to estimate the costs and benefits of competing antidepressants as well as to evaluate the costs and benefits of alternative models of care (e.g., usual care v. enhanced care).</p>
<p>Ransohoff and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272989X12458160">31</xref></sup> have addressed the need for a sufficiently detailed and transparent model development framework in clinical guidelines making. We propose a methodological framework for developing reference models with a focus on their applicability in the context of national reimbursement decisions in countries like Australia and UK. The proposed framework describes a process whereby HTA stakeholders (e.g., clinicians, policy makers, industry) share, test and agree on model structures and inputs. We use the ISPOR Task Force’s report on the conceptualization of a model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X12458160">27</xref></sup> for the development of a model to propose our framework.</p>

<sec id="section2-0272989X12458160">
<title>How the Process would Work in Practice</title>
<p>Jackson and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X12458160">23</xref>,p665</sup> recommended that reference models (referred to as global models in their paper) be built by including clinical events/states “as finely as is necessary to capture differences between competing interventions.” However, no comprehensive process for the development of such models has been proposed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X12458160">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates our proposed methodological framework for the development of reference models, which consists of 7 steps. The framework that we propose allows for input from a wide range of stakeholders (e.g., government, industry, clinicians).</p>

</fig>
<p>We propose a “reference model research unit or group” (e.g., within independent academic HTA centers commissioned by national reimbursement institutions) that is responsible for undertaking and overseeing the development of reference models. To adopt an explicit process, as recommended by the ISPOR Task Force’s report on the conceptualization of a model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X12458160">27</xref></sup> the model developers need expert inputs. For each reference model to be developed, we suggest the creation of 2 steering groups containing different sets of expertise that have an advisory role for different developmental steps.</p>
<p>The first group is a clinical group (for appraisal and comment on Steps 1 and 3 outlined below) comprising clinical experts, including general physicians, and specialists relevant to the condition under study. Inputs from this group are sought as to whether the proposed model structure sufficiently represents the disease process and disease management pathways. The source and number of professionals and how they are selected (e.g., nominations from a specialty college or association of professionals) would need to be mutually agreed by stakeholders. As the goal is to develop a reference model for a disease area rather than a model specific to a new intervention, professional and financial conflicts of interest are less likely to affect the advice received. For example, in Australia the Royal Australian College is a potential source of nominations for the clinical group.</p>
<p>The second group is a model evaluation group (for appraisal and comment on Steps 6 and 7 outlined below) and would comprise experts in HTA (preferably with experience related to the condition under study), representatives of the national reimbursement body, and sponsors of submissions to the reimbursement institution (i.e., industry representatives).</p>
<sec id="section3-0272989X12458160">
<title>Step 1: Choice of a Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>All valid models are based on an appropriate conceptual framework. The choice of a conceptual framework will be made using evidence and clinical inputs. This choice requires the following steps.</p>
<list id="list1-0272989X12458160" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1.1. A systematic review of clinical literature related to the condition under study is undertaken. This review documents the progression of the condition and summarizes a set of main clinical events and their relationships and relevant patient attributes that influence disease pathways and/or response to treatment. This systematic review can be done <italic>de novo</italic>, or, alternatively, systematic reviews underpinning existing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines pertinent to the health system can be updated. A review of existing models is also suggested that informs the importance of identified events from the economic perspective. The clinical events identified should be disaggregated where there are likely to be “important” differences between the disaggregated events with respect to expected disease progression, associated costs, or associated outcomes (e.g., quality of life).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1.2. If the current evidence is noninformative (insufficient or conflicting evidence), more than one plausible model framework can be proposed (see Bilcke and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12458160">32</xref></sup> for more details).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1.3. Expert engagement: To finalize the structure of the model, the face validity of the frameworks needs to be tested by the clinical group using qualitative research methods (e.g., focus group discussions, Delphi techniques) in order to reach a consensus as to whether the model structure (or structures) reflects the natural history of the condition under study.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0272989X12458160">
<title>Step 2: Choice of Modeling Technique (Implementation Framework)</title>
<p>The criteria proposed by landmark articles in selecting appropriate modeling techniques (e.g., Barton and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X12458160">33</xref></sup> and Karnon and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12458160">4</xref></sup>) can be applied. The most common types of modeling techniques include decision trees, cohort and individual-based Markov models, and discrete event simulation. The choice of modeling technique would be appropriate to the nature of the clinical problem under evaluation (e.g., acute v. chronic condition). In brief, the decision tree is an appropriate modeling technique when relevant events occur over a short time period. For longer time frames over which events may recur over time, cohort Markov models are more appropriate, unless the probability of moving to the next health state can be influenced by an individual’s history. For example, in a depression model, the probability of recurrence (i.e., from “well” to “depressive episode”) increases with the number of previous depressive episodes that patients experience and the duration of episodes. The process of expansion in the number of health states required to address the above issues can soon result in an unwieldy number of health states. In such cases, individual-based state transition model or discrete event simulation may be considered as more appropriate modeling techniques.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0272989X12458160">
<title>Step 3: Construction of Reference Models</title>
<p>The extent to which the benefits of the reference model structure are realized is in part determined by the data available to populate the model.</p>
<list id="list2-0272989X12458160" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3.1. A systematic identification of the relevant data sources (e.g., published literature, national registries or patient-level databases) is undertaken. This review will inform the best available sources of data to populate, calibrate, and validate the proposed models.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3.2. A model cannot be constructed independently of considerations of the data available to populate it. If the data sources identified in Step 3.1 do not inform the estimation of all the required input parameters to construct the model, an expert elicitation process should be undertaken using the clinical group to explore the possibility of using expert opinion to fill gaps in data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272989X12458160">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272989X12458160">35</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3.3. If Step 3.2 fails to fill gaps in data and relevant calibration targets cannot be identified (i.e., targets that are part determined by parameters for which direct data are absent), a modified model structure (or structures) should be considered. Decisions with respect to the level of granularity with which states and patient attributes are represented will be made in consultation with the clinical group.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3.4. Information generated from the above steps can then be used to construct the reference models using appropriate decision analytic modeling software (e.g., SIMUL8, TreeAge, etc.).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3.5. If more than 1 plausible model is constructed, structural uncertainty should be handled appropriately. Different approaches are used to characterize structural uncertainty. The simplest way is to implement and analyze a range of alternative model structures and to present the results from each model as scenario analyses. Taking varicella zoster vaccination as an example, there is conflicting evidence on whether exposure to naturally acquired varicella provides immunity against the dormant virus (“exogenous boosting”) and hence reduces the risk of its reactivation as herpes zoster (shingles) decades later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272989X12458160">36</xref></sup> This assumption is important for economic evaluations of national varicella immunization programs, as mass vaccination can lead to an increase in herpes zoster incidence in adults by reducing their exposure to varicella. It is informative to present both scenarios including and excluding exogenous boosting in the model structure. However, this approach puts the burden of assessing the relative credibility of the alternative structures on the end user.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In their review, Bojke and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X12458160">37</xref></sup> identified 2 quantitative techniques to represent structural uncertainty: model selection and model averaging. Both techniques involve developing a set of plausible models using different structural assumptions. The “model selection” approach ranks alternative models according to some measure of prediction performance or goodness of fit and selects the single model that maximizes that particular criterion. The effect of selecting a single model will depend on the relevance of the criterion used to select the model and the magnitude of the difference in the predictive power of the alternative model structures. “Model averaging” methods assess structural uncertainty by assigning weights to a range of alternative model structures according to some measure of model adequacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272989X12458160">38</xref></sup> Weighted model outputs are then estimated across all model structures included in the model averaging process. The weightings should reflect the probability that each model is the correct model and are derived using some measure of predictive power (e.g., Akaike’s information criterion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272989X12458160">39</xref></sup>), or expert elicitation methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X12458160">23</xref></sup> Strong and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272989X12458160">40</xref></sup> described a model discrepancy approach that focuses on the joint effects of structural and parameter uncertainty and quantifies the discrepancy between the output of the model and the true target value using either a Bayesian framework or expert judgments. The main limitation of the quantitative approaches is the necessary restriction of the process to representing the elements of structural uncertainty that are linked to outputs for which observed data are available.</p>
<p>Nonparameterizable structural uncertainty, as noted by Bilcke and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12458160">32</xref></sup> should be addressed by presenting a set of plausible choices about a particular structural aspect, as described in Step 3.5. The uncertainty around the boosting effect in model-based studies of varicella vaccination is difficult to parameterize,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272989X12458160">31</xref></sup> and hence a set of alternative model structures should be presented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0272989X12458160">
<title>Step 4: Model Performance: Validation and Calibration</title>
<p>Establishing model accuracy is an essential part of developing a decision analytic model. A validation process is undertaken to examine the consistency of model outputs with observed data (independent of the data used to populate the model, if possible) as recommended by ISPOR Task Force Working Group on Model transparency and validation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12458160">41</xref></sup> Because the best available data should be used to construct the model, most often, summary results from published studies (which cannot be used to estimate all transition probabilities) can be used to test the validation of the proposed model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X12458160">42</xref></sup> These sources of data are identified during the suggested literature review (Step 3.1). If no data are available for undertaking a validation process, this should be explicitly stated. Model calibration may also be used as a complement to model validation, particularly with respect to representing joint uncertainty around multiple model parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272989X12458160">43</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0272989X12458160">
<title>Step 5: Improving the Credibility of the Model</title>
<p>To test the credibility of reference models to potential users, an HTA unit whose model evaluators are independent of the model construction process will receive a copy of the developed reference model. This includes a full technical report describing development of the model, data sources used to populate the model, and validation processes. The HTA unit would critically appraise the model and report on its validity to the relevant national reimbursement body. Feedback can then be used to refine the reference model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0272989X12458160">
<title>Step 6: Feasibility of Using Reference Models</title>
<p>In this step, the feasibility of using reference models as part of the reimbursement process will be examined. Feasibility issues will be explored by the <italic>model evaluation group</italic> using qualitative research methods in which the level of agreement will be assessed and areas of consensus identified. For example, reference models could be provided to any industry applicant intending to submit a technology in the relevant disease area at the prelodgement meeting where a preliminary outline of the minimal requirements for evidence demonstrating safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the proposed health technology will be discussed. Applicants could update the inputs used to populate the model but would be expected to revalidate the model using similar validation methods to those used during the original development of the model. Likewise, applicants would be free to use an alternative model structure, but it would have to be fully justified. The outputs of alternative models can be compared against the reference model, which provides a basis for confirming any claimed advantages of new model structures (e.g., variations in model outputs should correlate with changes in model structure).</p>

<title>Step 7: Updating Model Structure</title>
<p>Over time, reference models will need to be updated, with respect to structure and/or data inputs, for example, when new evidence (i.e., about the natural history of the condition, or data to populate or validate the model) becomes available. The issue of updating model structures when new evidence becomes available should be addressed by undertaking a consultation process using the model evaluation group.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Model-based economic evaluations contain a number of sources of uncertainty including parameter, methodological, and structural uncertainties. Structural uncertainty is a neglected area in guidelines developed by national reimbursement bodies with consequential impact on the accuracy of public funding decisions. Inaccuracy in models is particularly important in decision processes that involve long-term estimation of costs and benefits, since any inaccuracies will be magnified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272989X12458160">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Considerable uncertainty with consequential impact on model outputs exists if there are major flaws in the structure of a model. This is particularly important in the HTA domain where economic evaluations can be easily manipulated to produce the best public funding outcome for the sponsor of a technology. Within the current timeline of an appraisal, and given other potential factors such as the lack of sufficient skills for model structure checking, HTA evaluators find it difficult to undertake detailed critical appraisals of model structures.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a step-by-step framework for developing reference models that can be used to inform public funding decisions. The use of these models is likely to improve the transparency, accuracy, and comparability of national reimbursement decisions. Improved accuracy of national reimbursement decisions can result in more realistic estimates of cost-effectiveness. This may also demonstrate cost savings from withholding funding from health technologies that are not cost-effective (and which would previously have been funded) or obtaining new technologies at lower prices as companies negotiate prices to make their technologies cost-effective. It is expected that the proposed framework will influence guideline development (guidelines for preparing submissions to national reimbursement bodies) around the choice of the model structure. This can reduce one significant source of industry-induced bias. Also, potential for manipulation by sponsors would be reduced by using a more detailed and transparent evaluation framework by national reimbursement bodies. The use of reference models can also reduce duplication of effort by HTA stakeholders, that is, industry and reimbursement bodies (avoiding “reinventing the wheel”). This speeds up evaluation processes and hence patient access to new technologies.</p>
<p>By reflecting the natural history of the condition under study more accurately, reference models can reduce the impact of structural uncertainty on findings. However, we emphasize that reference models are not intended to replace structural sensitivity analyses. In the presence of uncertain or conflicting evidence, structural uncertainty should be represented. The credibility of reference models strongly depends on the quality of data used to build or validate them. The issue around quality of evidence and generalizability to different settings is a significant challenge that has not been explored in the proposed framework (see Nuijten<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272989X12458160">45</xref></sup> for more details on the selection of data sources in model-based studies). Given the key role of experts in developing reference models, particular attention should be given to the choice of experts. These practical concerns, and their impact on the proposed framework, could only be explored fully after implementation of the framework and are likely to depend on the health system in which the framework is used.</p>
<p>The process can be used to construct appropriate decision analytic models for a wide range of disease areas. The proposed framework represents a practical approach for developing reference models. It is expected that application of the proposed framework would enhance model transparency, accuracy, and comparability and would ultimately improve the efficiency of public funding decisions. This translates into a more efficient use of scarce health resources and improved population health.</p>
