<abstract>
<p>Here we consider the consumer society as it currently exists in the UK and examine its relationship and relevance to the population of individuals with intellectual disability. We do this through a reading of the associated literature on theories of shopping and consumption which we then contrast with research evidence as it applies to the lives of people with intellectual disability. By brining together these two perspectives we hope to shine some light on ideas around identity and choice.</p>
<p>We then transfer these arguments to the health and social care sector. Here we ask whether an economic model which has been exposed as divisive and exclusionary should be used in the administration of social secutity benefits of the kind accesed by people with a range of disabilities.</p>
<p>We conclude that the unchallenged advance of marketisation within health and social care may benefit those who are financially able but for those who are economically disadvantaged the choices offered are illusory at best.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>A standard liberal view of capitalism is that it empowers consumers through choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1744629512445844">Shankar et al., 2006</xref>). Greener’s analysis highlights that this thinking has been employed within health and social care services, where ‘patients have been positioned through the choices available to them in the history of the National Health Service’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1744629512445844">2007</xref>: 59). Choice was once the guiding mantra of care services for people then described as having learning disability. Along with community presence and participation, competence and respect it was a central part of the policy backdrop in the UK move towards community care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1744629512445844">O’Brien, 1989</xref>). This strand in turn had its conceptual roots in earlier work which promoted the ‘normalization’ of human services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1744629512445844">Nirje, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1744629512445844">Wolfensberger, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1744629512445844">1983</xref>).</p>
<p>In the UK this translated as community care (DHSS, 1990). In the remaining years of the 1990s, quality of life became a focus as some of the unintended consequences of community living were played out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744629512445844">Brown and Smith, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744629512445844">Emerson and Hatton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744629512445844">Felce and Perry, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>However, while the move towards community care would later become characterized as a struggle for rights, choice (again), independence and inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744629512445844">Department of Health, 2001</xref>), the harsher realities of residential care during the 1990s were being exposed as less than idyllic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1744629512445844">Myers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744629512445844">Jones et al., 1999</xref>). For example, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1744629512445844">McVilly (1995</xref>) actually interviewed people living in their new homes about their post-institutional lives, the conversation was restricted to the services they received within the accommodation and how to improve them rather than exploring the world beyond the front door.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744629512445844">Cullen et al. (1995</xref>) then attempted some comparison with a group of people who had remained within an institutional environment and a group who had been living in the community for 30 months. The differences in quality of life between the two were described as ‘modest’.</p>
<p>It was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744629512445844">Brown (1994</xref>) who made the breakthrough with her incisive analysis and eye-catching title: ‘What price theory if you cannot afford the bus fare?’. People, she argued, may have moved out of the institution but the institution remained with them in their daily routines. They were living <italic>in </italic>the community but they were not part of it because the financial support that would enable them to participate was missing. The social roles available to them were devalued as a result as the insights of social role valorization were ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1744629512445844">Race et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This discussion article attempts to link the social situation of people with intellectual disability to their partial involvement in what has been described as ‘the unchallenged ideology of our times’, namely the so-called ‘consumer society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744629512445844">Gabriel and Lang, 1995</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>We will consider some theoretical background on consumption and then try to explore its relationship to community presence and participation to discover what impact this has on people with intellectual disability. We are concerned to discover how their general situation is affected and in particular how the concept of choice impacts on a sense of self.</p>
<p>The debate will consider the apparent contradiction of choice as an organizing concept for identity and as a goal of social policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744629512445844">Department of Health, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744629512445844">2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744629512445844">2009b</xref>). When it comes to the consumer society we ask: are we really all in it together?</p>

<title>The theory of shopping</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1744629512445844">Spitzer (1975</xref>: 642) once observed that in industrial societies, where employment and production drive the economy, those sectors of the population who do not contribute are constructed as deviant, even to the extent of being criminalized. In a post-industrial society the social relations that once produced class divisions are less evident. As Gilleard and Higgs observe: ‘Rather than class coming to serve as a cornerstone in people’s sense of self, that role increasingly is performed through consumption’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744629512445844">2000</xref>: 31). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1744629512445844">Ritzer (1999</xref>) argues that the new means of consumption imply that membership of this consumer society is continually reinforced as a necessary prerequisite for full engagement with contemporary life. Here individuals and groups who wish to practise consumption are increasingly required to think, feel and behave in a prescribed fashion according to the economically driven imperatives of commercial enterprises. Bauman too has noted that ‘people are groomed and trained to meet the demands of their social identities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744629512445844">1998</xref>: 24). For those with intellectual disability this process might lead to an uncomfortable fit between their aspirations and their abilities to engage in consumption practices.</p>
<p>With talk of identity the socio-medically constructed concept of intellectual disability is now well situated for discussion. From these initial observations some broader topics become available. For example, Edwards suggests that talk of the consumer society ‘starts to open up questions concerning power and inequality, individualism and identity, and social and economic stratification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744629512445844">2000</xref>: 3–4). This clearly invites a consideration of how the lives of those living outside the mainstream may be affected by the debate.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744629512445844">Aldridge (2003</xref>: 6) identifies three distinct aspects of consumerism. He argues that it can be seen as a species of social movement, characterized as a contest between suppliers and customers; as a form of lifestyle, addressing matters of taste, style and distinction, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1744629512445844">Veblen (1899</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744629512445844">Bourdieu (1979</xref>); and as ideology, whereby it acts to legitimize capitalism.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1744629512445844">Paterson (2006</xref>) then describes a situation in which he contrasts the individual consumer with the global market which takes little account of individual patterns of consumption. Due to this neglect of the individual <italic>qua </italic>person the consumer tends to be viewed as an ideal type, abstracted for marketing purposes and aggregated within economic forecasts and reviews.</p>
<p>Do individuals with intellectual disability merit a place in discussions on consumerism?</p>
<p>Bocock’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512445844">1993</xref>) analysis offers links that can be interpreted with intellectual disability in mind. He observes that ‘Consumers, in the early modern period, may be defined as groups for whom patterns of consumption played a central role in their lives, providing them with ways of marking themselves off from other social status groups’ (1993: 15).</p>
<p>This may well be true but, we might argue, people with intellectual disabilities come ready segregated. Bocock goes on, however: ‘Consumption, therefore, can be seen as a set of social and cultural practices which serve as a way of establishing differences between social groups, not merely as a way of expressing differences which are already in place as a result of an autonomous set of economic factors’ (1993: 64).</p>
<p>This seems to have direct relevance. He concludes his argument by saying that ‘consumption practices and aspirations [are] becoming central to the social construction of identity, within the analytical model of post-modernity’ (1993: 79).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1744629512445844">
<title>The practice of shopping</title>
<p>The consumer is thought of as an ‘identity seeker’ who looks for validation through their shopping activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744629512445844">Gabriel and Lang, 1995</xref>). But identity does not exist in a vacuum and the expression of self through consumer durables has subsequently been noted by Gilleard and Higgs, who remark that<disp-quote>
<p>postmodern writers have argued that the rise of consumer society and the consequent emphasis upon lifestyle have led to a radical change in the determination of identity … Increasingly identities are expressed, revised and represented through consumption. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744629512445844">2000</xref>: 28)</p>
</disp-quote>The implication for the constituency of people with intellectual disabilities seems to be that in any society where there is an undue emphasis on material wealth, an individual exhibiting an inability to fully engage with the expectations and mores of society may become regarded as less than a fully fledged citizen. Sayer, for example, has noted that<disp-quote>
<p>Inequalities in consumption are important not only directly in terms of inequalities in the amounts of possessions, but also indirectly in terms of the resulting differences of access to internal and external goods and in terms of the distortion of moral sentiments that result from this so that consumption is seen as an indicator of moral worth. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1744629512445844">2003</xref>: 355)</p>
</disp-quote>Out of this position it is perhaps too easy to relegate disadvantaged minorities to a lesser standing in society and to exclude them physically and financially from the benefits that genuine inclusion can bring. For people living with intellectual disability it can be difficult to access the nodes of consumption without engaging with other parties, a point raised by the individuals in the focus groups run by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744629512445844">Abbot and McConkey (2006</xref>). This is not without its own problems. As Trentmann notes, ‘Consumers do not emerge on their own but in dynamic relations with other social actors and agencies. These relationships involve uneven access to expertise, authority and power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1744629512445844">2006</xref>: 14).</p>
<p>And yet for some commentators the consumer role remains pivotal and ‘is viewed as the central focal interest of people in advanced industrial societies and the cornerstone today for the construction of identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744629512445844">Gottdiener, 2000</xref>: ix). Again, this raises direct questions for those groups who, for a variety of reasons, are marginalized within if not directly excluded from the shopping centres and the high street.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1744629512445844">
<title>Shopping and identity</title>
<p>In crude summary, social identity theory posits that in social settings similar individuals will group together in ways that act to reinforce a stronger sense of identity to the exclusion of those seen to be ‘different’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1744629512445844">Tajfel, 1974</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1744629512445844">Tajfel and Turner, 1986</xref>). Following this line of argument, people with intellectual disability as a group will, due to their perceived status, be socially ostracized by those without intellectual disabilities and they will then, as a response, tend to cluster together, thus reinforcing the status quo.</p>
<p>The social legitimacy of individuals labelled with intellectual disability was challenged before social identity theory was developed, principally by those from a determinedly eugenicist background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744629512445844">Digby, 1996</xref>). The worst excesses of this approach have subsequently been eroded by legislation and more enlightened attitudes. Shotter describes the dilemma thus:<disp-quote>
<p>To be a person and to qualify for certain rights as a free, autonomous individual, one must also be able to show in one’s actions certain social competencies, that is, to fulfil certain duties and to be accountable to others in the sense of being able to justify one’s actions to them, when challenged, in relation to the ‘social reality’ of the society of which one is a member. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1744629512445844">1993</xref>: 193)</p>
</disp-quote>It may be that the social practice of shopping and the concept of the consumer present a challenge that some marginalized groups and individuals will find difficult to meet. One aspect unites the marginalized, and that is their relative poverty. And yet despite this, people labelled with intellectual disability clearly do participate, to some extent, in the typical social activities that characterize the consumer society. Bryman suggests that one key difference here is that some individuals ‘do not consume in the way society expects’, being rendered unable to conform fully to the blandishments of the corporate ideologies that dominate sales and retail practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744629512445844">2004</xref>: 173).</p>
<p>We have some evidence to support this from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744629512445844">Buttimer and Tierney (2005</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744629512445844">Forrester-Jones et al. (2006)</xref> who describe the shopping experiences and activities of people with intellectual disability as passive consumers as they accompany family members and/or support staff on shopping trips.</p>
<p>Lury observed that ‘It is in acquiring, using and exchanging things that individuals come to have social lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744629512445844">1996</xref>: 12). The social lives of people labelled with intellectual disability might suggest that they are not so readily able to engage in such practices. In these aspects at least they fitted the pattern suggested by Bocock when he said that ‘once people have been influenced by what might be called the social and cultural practices associated with the ideology of modern consumerism, then even if they cannot afford to buy the goods portrayed in films, in the press and on television, they can and do desire them’ (1993: 3).</p>
<p>We have so far outlined areas where the theory and practice of consumerism seem to conflict with the aspirations of people with intellectual disability in the way it constructs identity and problematizes choice. Here, in relation to traditional high street practices, Edwards warned that economically disadvantaged sections of society would find ‘shopping is experienced as a window through which they are invited to look and a door through which they cannot enter’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744629512445844">2000</xref>: 124). This seems an accurate reflection of the experiences of individuals with intellectual disability.</p>
<p>We now turn to contemporary health and social care policy and ask whether it can do anything to address this apparent inequality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1744629512445844">
<title>
<italic>Valuing People</italic>: the price of everything and the value of nothing?</title>
<p>Finlay, Finlay et al. begin their paper by stating that ‘recent government policy places the promotion of choice, control and empowerment as a central value for social care services’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744629512445844">2008</xref>: 1). Is this continued promotion of choice a reflection of the consumer society and a sign that health and social care policy will also be founded on a market model? If this is the case we are entitled to be concerned that people with intellectual disability will fare no better in shopping for care than they do when shopping in the high street.</p>
<p>The first serious steps to marketize the UK health and social care sector were taken under the Thatcher administration when the state was portrayed as a choice-denying monopoly, unable to offer the consumer any part in the decision-making processes that might affect their care and treatment (Department of Health and Social Security, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744629512445844">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1744629512445844">Secretary of State, 1989</xref>). The market, by contrast, was sold as being responsive to individual needs. Clarke described it this way when he said, ‘The provider monopolies of public services need to be broken up and subjected to the “real world” disciplines of the market place in order to empower the citizen-as-consumer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744629512445844">1996</xref>: 72). It was this reshaping of centralized service provision which led to the idea that the money available could be better spent by targeting benefits directly to their intended recipients.</p>
<p>The personalization agenda, so called, was outlined in <italic>Putting People First</italic>, where the goal was described as delivering ‘maximum choice and control for service users’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744629512445844">Department of Health, 2007</xref>: 3). This is currently being enacted in a series of welfare reforms. The Welfare Reform Bill, introduced in early 2011, proposes several changes which are of direct consequence to people living with disability. One such is the proposal, in Part IV of the bill, for the replacement of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) with the Personal Independence Payment (PIP). PIPs are set to replace Disability Living Allowance from 2013, and comprise two components (‘daily living’ and ‘mobility’) both payable at two separate rates (‘standard’ and ‘enhanced’) calculated on the severity of the disability. </p>
<p>The official rhetoric from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) states that PIPs will ‘focus support to those individuals who experience the greatest challenges to remaining independent and leading full, active and independent lives’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/disability/personal-independence-payment/">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/disability/personal-independence-payment/</ext-link>, accessed January 2012). What is clear is that this focus will be on fewer individuals. As part of the consultation process the DWP has calculated that with no reform to the system 2.2 million people would receive DLA in 2015–16 as against the 1.7 million who would receive PIPs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/pip-assessment-thresholds-and-consultation.pdf">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/pip-assessment-thresholds-and-consultation.pdf</ext-link>, accessed February 2012). Such calculations have real consequences. These consequences were noted some time ago.</p>
<p>In 1976, members of the Union of Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS) met with members of the Disability Alliance. Out of this exchange both campaign groups drew up a document which later came to be known as the ‘Fundamental Principles of Disability’. They made this point about benefits:<disp-quote>
<p>Benefits which are not carefully related to the struggle for integrated employment and active social participation will constantly be used to justify our dependence and exclusion from the mainstream of life – the very opposite of what is needed. (UPIAS/Disability Alliance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1744629512445844">1976</xref>: 15)</p>
</disp-quote>This very succinctly highlights the irony of the situation we find today. On the one hand we have seen that the ‘consumer society’ is constructed in such a way that those who lack purchasing power are excluded from membership. And yet we now see a government policy that is premised on precisely the same market principles. The only difference is that the individual with a disability is now being encouraged to purchase care with their benefits (via their personalized budget) and moreover the care services on offer are increasingly beyond and outside the control of the state, being essentially private sector businesses and products. In this way the ideology of the free market infiltrates social policy. Through the use of terms like ‘choice and control’ in policy documents, the end user is constructed as a fully fledged consumer. </p>
<p>For some this may be a positive move. A survey undertaken for the Think Local, Act Personal Partnership,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1744629512445844">1</xref>
</sup> and carried out by In Control and the Centre for Disability Research at Lancaster University, found improved outcomes and an overall positive impact on the lives of the individuals accessing personal budgets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744629512445844">Hatton and Waters, 2011</xref>). Even so another survey by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) found that uptake of personal budgets had peaked at a round 35 percent of eligible users and carers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744629512445844">ADASS, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>However, all of the above needs to be taken in context, and that context is provided by the Dilnot Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744629512445844">2011</xref>). In crude summary the figure put on reform of social care is £1.7 billion. At the time of writing the official government response is still awaited.</p>

<title>Conclusions and next steps</title>
<p>Edgell et al. observed that the concept of consumption could be applied to ‘everything from art to shopping, to watching television, receiving welfare and visiting a zoo’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744629512445844">1996</xref>: 1). Bauman confirmed the wide range of consumption practices, noting that ‘In a consumer society, a “normal life” is the life of consumers, preoccupied with making their choices among the panoply of publicly displayed opportunities for pleasurable sensations and lively experiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744629512445844">1998</xref>: 37). Matched against this template, people labelled with intellectual disability are constructed by what they are not, by what they do not do, and by what they cannot afford (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1744629512445844">Mullaney, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed in <italic>Improving Services, Improving Lives </italic>we find that disabled people feel ‘steered towards choices made by other people’ in their daily lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1744629512445844">Social Exclusion Unit, 2005</xref>: 64). This can be seen even in the minutiae of consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744629512445844">Davies, 2007</xref>). This is as true in the high street as it is in the world of care services, where people with intellectual disability are constructed as consumers by the benefit system. By providing targeted benefits and allowing some privatization of the social care sector, the government has created a cartel and channelled service users into some poor quality care settings.</p>
<p>Here the consequences of ‘shopping’ for social care are apparent when we consider that Castlebeck Care (Teesdale) Limited is one such provider and that some of their former ‘customers’ in Winterbourne View had reason to be dissatisfied with the service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744629512445844">BBC, 2011</xref>). The same is true of residents who were living under the auspices of Southern Cross Healthcare when it collapsed in debt in June 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1744629512445844">Wachman, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Our argument has used discussions around consumerism to focus on the social situation of people living with intellectual disability today in contemporary UK society.</p>
<p>Studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744629512445844">Emerson (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744629512445844">Emerson and Hatton (2007)</xref> have demonstrated that to live with an intellectual disability is to live in relative poverty. By focusing on the consumer society we have been able to highlight how stark the contrast is between those who can engage in practices associated with consumption and those who are excluded from them. And we have seen that this is as true when shopping for goods as it is when shopping for services.</p>
<p>Our examination of contemporary social policy also seems to indicate that while the rhetoric promises inclusion and choice, the reality is that treating disability benefit claimants as customers actually limits their options. Shankar et al. refer to this when they say that ‘consumers can be empowered or liberated through exercising choice but that choice is also disciplining and potentially paralyzing’ (2006: 1014).</p>
<p>The current commercialization of health and social care services constructs us all as consumers. From this we conclude that work needs to be undertaken to understand the consequences of constructing the person with intellectual disability as a consumer in a marketplace of goods and services where that individual has limited rights and resources. Here we can see the structural and ideological imperatives that maintain the differences between those labelled with intellectual disability and those who label them; between those who have and those who have not.</p>
