<abstract>
<p>Function-focused care (FFC) was developed to change the philosophy of care in assisted living (AL) to one in which nurses, direct care workers (DCWs) and other members of the health care team work with residents to optimize function and time spent in physical activities. The purpose of this article is to describe dissemination and implementation of FFC within the two assisted living communities in Maryland that were randomized to our FFC for assisted living intervention (FFC-AL). The reach, efficacy/effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) model was used to evaluate dissemination and implementation of FFC in these communities. A total of 171 residents and 96 DCWs consented to participate in the study and outcomes based on data collected from the participants as well as evidence for dissemination and implementation at the site level are provided. Findings can be used to guide others in dissemination and implementation of similar interventions in AL communities.</p>

<p>Function-focused care for assisted living (FFC-AL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0733464811419285">Resnick, Galik, Gruber-Baldini, &amp; Zimmerman, 2009</xref>) was developed to address the persistent decline in function noted in older adults living in assisted living (AL) communities. In the United States, ALs are residential long-term care settings that provide housing, 24-hr oversight, personal care services, health-related services, or a combination of these on an as needed basis. The regulations associated with ALs vary by state in terms of the qualifications of nursing staff (licensed and unlicensed direct care workers) and the ratio of nursing staff to residents. In Maryland the requirement is that the ratio must be sufficient to meet the needs of the residents. For communities in Maryland with 50 residents or more, a minimum of 56-hr (8 hr a day 7 days a week) of licensed nursing oversight is required.</p>
<p>Residents living in ALs are medically, functionally, and/or cognitively impaired. The majority require some assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). The care needed is provided by direct care workers (DCWs) under the supervision of licensed nurses. Payment for AL is generally on a pay-for-service basis (i.e., those needing more personal care pay a higher rate). Residents in AL communities, have been noted to decline functionally more rapidly than residents in nursing home settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0733464811419285">Fonda, Clipp, &amp; Maddox, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464811419285">Frytak, Kane, Finch, Kane, &amp; Maude-Griffin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0733464811419285">Resnick &amp; Jung, 2006</xref>). We anticipate that the philosophy of care in AL communities and pay for service model may propagate this decline.</p>
<p>Based on writings of Florence Nightingale as far back as 1859, the philosophy of nursing care was defined as being in “charge of the personal health of somebody . . . and what nursing has to do . . . is to put the patient in the best condition for nature to act upon him.” This philosophy, while innovative when established, suggests a framework in which nurses are in control and doing <italic>for</italic> rather than providing care <italic>with</italic> the patient. This philosophy of care has been translated into AL communities where the focus of care is on meeting residents’ needs through task completion (e.g., to bathe or dress the individual) rather than optimize underlying physical capability. Unfortunately, such attentive care decreases the older individuals’ opportunity to perform even routine activities and thereby engage in some level of physical activity (e.g., soap the sponge, manipulate one’s arm into a sleeve). Thus, our goal in implementing FFC was to change the philosophy of care in AL communities to one in which DCWs do not simply perform the task for the resident. Rather, the resident is evaluated to identify underlying capability and a plan is established to help the resident achieve and maintain his or her highest level of function (e.g., bathing, dressing, ambulation) and engage in physical activity. Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscle that requires energy expenditure.</p>

<title>The Function-Focused Care Intervention</title>
<p>The FFC-AL intervention has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464811419285">Resnick, Galik, Gruber-Baldini &amp; Zimmerman, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0733464811419285">Resnick, Galik, et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, FFC-AL involves identification of a FFC champion in the AL community who works with our research supported FFC Nurse (FFCN) to implement the following four components: (1) Environment and policy/procedure assessments; (2) Education; (3) Developing function-focused goals; and (4) Mentoring and motivating (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0733464811419285">Table 1</xref>). Components were implemented sequentially although they overlapped in that once they were initiated they continued throughout the course of the intervention. The FFCN worked within the community for 15 hr per week for the 1st 6 months of the intervention, 8 hr a week for the next 3 months, and 4 hr a week for the final 3 months of the intervention. Throughout this time an AL community-based champion was trained to continue oversight of the FFC philosophy once it became routine care within the community. Although all staff were invited to participate in education associated with implementation of FFC-AL, we collected outcome data only on the residents and DCWs who consented to participate in the research and were willing to complete survey and objective measures. Prior research provided evidence for the benefit of our FFC approach with regard to maintaining function and increasing physical activity in residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0733464811419285">Resnick, Galik, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464811419285">Resnick et al., 2009a</xref>) and improving staff knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors associated with FFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0733464811419285">Resnick, Galik, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0733464811419285">Resnick et al., 2009b</xref>).</p>

<title>Challenges to Dissemination and Implementation of Evidence-Based Interventions</title>
<p>Challenges and barriers to dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions such as FFC in AL and other long-term care settings have been identified and include such things as beliefs about the utility and feasibility of the new approach, insufficient training, insufficient recognition and support from administration, inadequate staffing, workload concerns, staff turnover, costs, lack of fit between the intervention and culture or philosophy of care within the community, and the physical environment (e.g., bed and chair height, open walkways; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464811419285">Beck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0733464811419285">Lekan-Rutledge, Palmer, &amp; Belyea, 1998</xref>; Schnelle, 2002). At the resident level, barriers to engaging in functional and physical activity have also been articulated and include new acute events (e.g., cerebrovascular events), age, sociodemographic characteristics, morbidities that affect function, cognitive decline, delirium, depressed mood, poor perceived health status, lack of motivation, cultural expectations, pain, fear of falling, body mass index, and polypharmacotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0733464811419285">Brown, Williams, &amp; Woodby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464811419285">Ouslander et al., 2005</xref>). From an organization perspective, it has been recognized that for implementation to occur, organizational leaders must decide to adopt and then take appropriate implementation steps that include identification of a champion, provision of administrative support, and a willingness to accept a run-in period that may not be cost neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0733464811419285">Reuben, 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0733464811419285">
<title>Theoretical Framework Used to Overcome Dissemination and Implementation Barriers</title>
<p>To address the many barriers at the staff, resident, and community level, FFC-AL was developed using a social ecological model (SEM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0733464811419285">Fleury &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0733464811419285">Sallis et al., 2006</xref>), with social cognitive theory (SCT) guiding the interpersonal aspects of the intervention. Unfortunately, even the combined use of SEM and SCT has not been sufficient for successful dissemination and implementation of innovative interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0733464811419285">Elder, Lytle, &amp; Sallis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0733464811419285">Sallis, et al., 2006</xref>) as these theoretical approaches focus on persuading individuals to change without adequate consideration of the importance of barriers related to the environment (physical and work), policies/procedures, attributes of the innovation, and the social systems in which dissemination and implementation occur. Therefore we combined the use of SEM and SCT with Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0733464811419285">Rogers, 2003</xref>) to optimally disseminate and implement FFC-AL throughout AL communities.</p>
<p>Dissemination focuses on the distribution of information, whereas implementation is the process through which an intervention such as FFC-AL is communicated over time through certain channels of a social system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0733464811419285">Rogers, 2003</xref>). DOI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0733464811419285">Rogers, 2003</xref>) suggests that the following four key components influence implementation: (1) Attributes of the innovation: (a) relative advantage, or the degree to which the innovation is perceived to be better than prior care/activity; (b) compatibility, or the degree to which an innovation fits with existing values, experiences, and needs of adopters; (c) complexity, or the degree to which an innovation is perceived as difficult to understand and use; (d) trialability, or the ability to experiment with an intervention on a limited basis; and (e) observability, which is evidence of positive outcomes associated with the intervention; (2) Communication through certain channels (e.g., interpersonal, mass media); (3) Timing of the intervention; and (4) The structure and impact of the social system (e.g., the presence and influence of change agents, opinion leaders, and champions).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0733464811419285">
<title>Evaluation of the Dissemination and Implementation of FFC-AL</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate dissemination and implementation of FFC-AL using the reach, efficacy/effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) model developed by Glasgow and colleagues, so as to inform future research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464811419285">Glasgow, Toobert, Hampson, &amp; Strycker, 2002</xref>). Reach refers to the proportion and representativeness of the population targeted by the intervention (i.e., who was eligible and who actually participated); efficacy/effectiveness refers to the extent to which the intervention improved outcomes of participants; adoption reflects the proportion of organizations or settings that adopt the intervention; implementation refers to treatment fidelity or evidence that the intervention could be implemented as intended in the proposed settings; and maintenance refers to long-term adherence to the intervention and transition of the intervention into routine care.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0733464811419285">Table 2</xref> delineates the RE-AIM dimensions and how each was measured in our evaluation of FFC-AL. To provide evidence of Reach in terms of disseminating FFC-AL, we considered the numbers of DCWs and residents who were interested and willing to participate in the study out of all DCWs working in and living in the communities at the time of the study. In addition, we evaluated in-service class sign in sheets and exercise class participation among residents to provide some evidence for involvement of nonconsented residents and DCWs in FFC. Efficacy of FFC-AL was based on our primary outcomes: improvement in function and amount of time spent in physical activity among residents; and increase in provision of function-focused care provided by DCWs based on direct observation. Evidence of adoption was based on the AL communities’ willingness to provide a champion and willingness to make some of the recommended environmental and policy changes necessary to facilitate function-focused care.</p>

<p>Implementation of FFC-AL was based on evidence of three of five aspects of treatment fidelity described in the Behavior Change Consortium Treatment Fidelity Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0733464811419285">Bellg et al., 2004</xref>) including (1) Delivery, or evidence that the intervention, FFC-AL, was implemented as intended; (2) Receipt, which focuses on whether or not the participant received and understood the intervention as intended; and (3) Enactment, which refers to evidence of engagement in the innovation or intervention activities in real world settings. Last, maintenance of FFC-AL was based on a review of environment and policy changes 6 months after we completed the study and evidence of maintenance of activities initiated during the course of the intervention including education for new staff, exercise classes offered by the activities department for residents and recognition of staff and residents who participate in FFC-related activities. FFC-related activities are defined as activities that encourage/allow residents to participate in personal care (e.g., bathing, dressing) at their highest level and/or engaging the resident in physical activities (e.g., going to an exercise class, walking to the dining room). This is in contrast to performing the care for the resident (e.g., bathing or dressing the individual).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study was a 12-month cluster-randomized controlled trial in which four AL communities were matched on ownership (two were from one AL company and the remaining two were from a different company) and randomly assigned using a coin flip for each of the pairs to treatment or attention (education) control. AL communities that were randomized to control were exposed to Component 2, education about FFC-AL. The education-only provided to those in the control group was the same educational information provided to those in the treatment sites. Teaching was done by a nurse not providing the full FFC-AL intervention in treatment sites during the study. The education was provided in a single one-time session and there was no other treatment interactions provided to control sites.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Maryland, Baltimore. A description of the communities has been published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464811419285">Resnick, Galik, Gruber-Baldini, &amp; Zimmerman, 2010</xref>); all had at least 100 beds and were staffed for and had services available to provide care for residents at the highest level possible in Maryland, Level 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0733464811419285">Maryland Health Care Commission, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A total of 171 residents and 96 DCWs provided consent and were eligible to participate in the study. DCWs were eligible to participate if they worked in the community at least 3 days a week and could read and write English. Residents were eligible to participate if they were 65 years of age or older, currently living in the community and scored at least 11 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0733464811419285">Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975</xref>). Residents were excluded from the study if they had a life expectancy of less than 6 months documented by the resident’s primary health care provider. If the resident did not pass the Evaluation to Sign Consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0733464811419285">Resnick, Gruber-Baldini, et al., 2007</xref>), he or she was asked to sign an assent to participate and the proxy was contacted to complete the consent process.</p>

<title>Measures Used to Provide Evidence of Dissemination and Implementation</title>
<p>Measures were completed at baseline, 4 and 12 months postimplementation of the intervention with the exception of knowledge of FFC among the DCWs, which was obtained at baseline and 12 months only.

<title>Resident Physical Activity</title>
<p>Physical activity was measured using the ActiGraph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464811419285">ActiGraph, 2004</xref>), a reliable and valid accelerometer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464811419285">ActiGraph, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0733464811419285">Friedman et. al, 2000</xref>).

Functional performance was measured using the Barthel Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0733464811419285">Mahoney &amp; Barthel, 1965</xref>) which includes 10 items measuring the resident’s daily functioning.

<sec id="section12-0733464811419285">
<title>Reach</title>
<p>The research team was initially provided with a list including 494 residents who were screened for participation. Of these, 123 (25%) were not eligible as they were deceased (<italic>n</italic> = 14), in hospice (<italic>n</italic> = 8), rehabilitation (<italic>n</italic> = 6), discharged from AL or in the hospital (<italic>n</italic> = 21), noncommunicative as per the Evaluation to Sign Consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0733464811419285">Resnick, Gruber-Baldini, et al, 2007</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 64), or younger than 65 years of age (<italic>n</italic> = 10). A total of 177 (48%) of the 371 eligible residents or proxies refused to provide consent, 9 (2%) proxies were not available to give consent, and 185 (50%) residents consented/assented to participate and were randomized, of whom 5 (3%) were subsequently noted to be ineligible due to scoring less than 11 on the MMSE, and 9 (5%) withdrew after consenting and prior to collection of baseline data. Thus, 171 residents out of the 371 eligible residents across all communities were included in the study indicating a reach of 46%. Over the course of the 12-month intervention period, none of the resident participants requested to be dropped from the study. At four months, 134 (78%) of the residents remained in the study, and at 12 months 101 (59%) of the residents remained in the study. Overall loss to follow-up of residents was mainly due to death or transfer to an alternative level of care. There were no differences between those who were lost to follow-up on baseline demographics or relevant outcomes.</p>
<p>Across all sites, a total of 147 DCWs were employed and of these 96 (65%) were recruited into the study; 32 (22%) were either no longer working in the community, on leave, or working less than 8 hr per week at the time of recruitment; and 19 (13%) refused to participate. As with residents, none of the DCWs requested to be removed from the study. At 4 months 85 (89%) remained in the study, and 69 (72%) remained at 12 months. The major reason for loss to follow-up was no longer being employed in the community.</p>
<p>There was evidence of participation in FFC-AL among participants who did not consent to the research evaluation. Specifically, all nonconsented DCWs in the communities documented when they provided FFC-related activities, helped develop FFC goals for residents, and rewarded residents when they engaged in physical activity. Nonconsented residents likewise participated in exercise classes offered and the Gifts of the Heart incentive program. Furthermore, qualitative reports indicated that nonconsented residents spoke with administrative staff in the communities to make sure that all new physical activity programs started during the study would continue after the study’s termination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0733464811419285">
<title>Efficacy/Effectiveness</title>
<p>With regard to our major study outcomes, DCWs demonstrated an increase in their performance of FFC-related activities such that those exposed to FFC-AL increased from providing FFC-related activities during 76% of observed care interactions at baseline to 82% at 4 months and 90% at 12 months, while the control group provided FFC-related activities during 75% of care interactions at baseline and 4 months, which decreased to 69% of care interactions at 12 months (<italic>p</italic> = .001 for comparison between treatment and control over time). The study results indicated that residents, in both treatment and control groups, showed a decline in function over 12 months. The decline in function was greater between baseline and 12 months for the control versus the treatment group (e.g., the control group declined 6.95 points on the Barthel Index vs. 4.33 points in the treatment group, <italic>p</italic> = .01). From baseline to 12 months, 13 (17%) residents in the treatment group versus 2 (4%) residents in the control group resumed walking functional distances versus remaining wheelchair dependent (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.94, <italic>p</italic> = .026). There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to actigraphy although positive trends were noted. Residents in the intervention group showed a greater increase in the amount of time spent in moderate level physical activity at 4 months (<italic>p</italic> = .08). Specifically, the treatment group increased from 0.43 at baseline to 1.00 min of moderate-level physical activity in 24 hr versus a decline in the control group from 0.51 to 0.35 min. In addition, the treatment group had an increase in counts of physical activity from 40,668 at 4 months to 46,960 at 12 months while the control group declined from 36,834 at 4 months to 32,563 at 12 months (<italic>p</italic> = .07).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0733464811419285">
<title>Adoption</title>
<p>There was some evidence of adoption of the intervention in that all organization leaders of the communities approached were willing to participate in the study and identify a champion to work with the research-supported FFCN. In both treatment communities, however, the champions who were initially identified resigned (not due to their role in FFC-AL) and new champions were identified by administration. It took several months in both communities, and trial and error, to establish a champion who initiated oversight of the DCWs as per our FFC-AL study activities. The champions’ greatest challenges to more active involvement were other job demands rather than any disagreement with the purpose and content of the program. Although it took approximately 6 months to establish regular meetings with community champions, by the end of the 12-month intervention period the champions were able to perform oversight of FFC activities and there were plans in place for future activities (e.g., ongoing exercise classes).</p>
<p>Adoption of FFC-AL was further supported based on evidence of changes in the physical environments of communities with resultant improvements in residents’ P-E Fit scores. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0733464811419285">Table 3</xref>, there was a significant decrease in environmental barriers to physical activity noted at 12 months with regard to the outside environment (<italic>p</italic> = .003), entrances (<italic>p</italic> = .04), and indoor environments (after controlling for baseline differences, <italic>p</italic> = .005). There was no change in the environment with regard to communication (e.g., signage).</p>

<title>Implementation</title>
<p>With regard to delivery of the intervention, there was evidence that all four proposed components of FFC-AL were implemented as intended. Starting with Component 1, the comprehensive assessment of the AL environment and community-based policies, and the culture and procedures related to FFC were evaluated at the onset of the intervention activities. This information was then reviewed with administrative staff to discuss areas in which changes could occur. Component 2 focused on education of DCWs, other community staff, families, and residents. We were able to deliver the FFC-AL educational material to all consented DCWs using multiple approaches so that those who did not attend the in-service were provided with the information using a face-to-face format in which the FFCN met with the DCW during the course of his or her workday. We provided all licensed nurses, therapists, activities and administrative staff with information about FFC-AL in written format. All families/proxies of residents who consented to participate in the study were sent materials about FFC-AL and the residents’ initial goal form. In addition, all families were invited to attend a family session to provide information about FFC-AL held in the evening; 25% of invited individuals attended the sessions.</p>
<p>Component 3, developing FFC goals, was implemented by the FFCN in collaboration with the community champion, resident, DCWs and therapists as appropriate (i.e., if the therapist had recently worked with the resident). Goals were established for all participating residents and reevaluated monthly throughout the course of the intervention period. Goals were maintained in a notebook accessible to all DCWs and nurses working with study participants. Approximately 10% of study participants did not establish goals and due to cognitive impairment another 10% were unable to recall having made goals during the course of the study period.</p>
<p>Last, Component 4, which focused on mentoring and motivating staff, was done formally during monthly evaluations of each consented DCW observed working with a resident. DCWs were recognized with gold stars on a bulletin board to indicate exemplary performance of FFC-related activities during observations. To motivate residents, we implemented a reward program, “Gifts of the Heart.” This involved giving tokens to residents who engaged in functional tasks or other types of physical activity (e.g., a resident who walked to the dining room or attended an exercise class). Residents could trade tokens for prizes from our glass display case of gifts.</p>
<p>In our control sites, delivery of the FFC-Education only intervention was implemented as per our intervention protocol. In communities randomized to this arm of the study, DCWs were invited to attend a formal class for education related to FFC. Using this approach, we reached only a small percentage of DCWs (12%-15%) across the two control sites. Receipt was evaluated using a paper and pencil test to consider if DCWs showed evidence of increased knowledge of FFC throughout the 12-month study period. DCWs in both treatment and control intervention communities demonstrated improvement in test scores over the 12-month period from a mean of 70% (<italic>SD</italic> = 11%) to a mean of 78% (<italic>SD</italic> = 13%, <italic>p</italic> = .001, measuring significance over time). Last, evidence of enactment was based on daily documentation of FFC-related activities performed by DCWs. Monthly log sheets were provided for all participating residents, and 53% were completed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0733464811419285">
<title>Maintenance</title>
<p>There was evidence of maintenance of FFC within treatment sites via evidence of permanent changes in physical environments, service plan forms, marketing materials, and job orientation of DCWs. Environmental changes included such things as flyers and bulletin boards in treatment communities reflecting the positive benefits of physical activity and encouraging residents to engage in these activities. In addition, as recommended by the FFCN, chairs were strategically placed along clear pathways appropriate for walking to encourage residents to walk these areas and yet provide appropriate rest areas. At the end of the study, treatment sites were exploring ways in which to alter their outdoor environments to be safer and allow for and encourage walking.</p>
<p>Another way in which maintenance of the intervention was demonstrated was based on continuation of exercise classes initiated during the study. Specifically, we taught activities staff how to implement a combined aerobic and resistive exercise program that was previously developed by our research team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0733464811419285">Resnick, Shaughnessy, et al., 2009</xref>). One of the sites was sending two individuals from the activities department to obtain certification as exercise therapists to engage residents in more rigorous physical activities than are traditionally implemented in these settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0733464811419285">Milano, 2006</xref>). Dance classes and a walking club replaced more sedentary activities. The “Gifts of the Heart” program was also adopted by AL staff and supported by administration financially by supplying the gifts.</p>
<p>Maintenance of FFC-AL was further demonstrated through changes in marketing materials, staff orientation, and service plans. We worked with marketing staff to incorporate a FFC philosophy into marketing materials on the web site. Anticipating the high turnover of staff commonly noted in long-term care environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464811419285">Beck et al., 2005</xref>; Schnelle, 2002), we worked with appropriate organizational leaders to develop a power point presentation using FFC-AL educational materials, which was incorporated into new staff orientation. Along with this material we developed a posttest to demonstrate learning. New staff in treatment communities had to obtain a passing score of 80 on the posttest or review FFC-AL materials and retake the test.</p>
<p>Last, we were able to change the service plan forms used in treatment communities to include a section on FFC. Service plans must be developed for each AL resident and reviewed every 6 months or on an as needed basis (e.g., if there was a change in the residents’ health status such as a stroke or hip fracture; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0733464811419285">Office of Health Care Quality, 2009</xref>). Traditionally, service plans focus on what DCWs do for residents’ (e.g., bathe, dress, put on shoes). We transitioned the wording and focus of the service plans to address what the <italic>resident</italic> was expected to perform and the ways in which the DCW would arrange care to facilitate resident performance. This is intended to facilitate ongoing adherence to a FFC philosophy of care.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section17-0733464811419285" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a RE-AIM Model, we demonstrated our ability to disseminate FFC across the AL communities in this study. There were, however, numerous challenges to our ability to disseminate and implement an FFC approach as proposed and it is these findings that guide and inform future research.</p>
<p>With regard to reach, it should be recognized and noted that educational exposure can be done using formal and informal one-on-one sessions and single or multiple sessions. Single in-service sessions conducted at the convenience of educators are not likely to succeed unless special arrangements have been made to assure staff attendance. Making a specific in-service mandatory, scheduling it as part of the DCWs work time, making the in-service relevant to the daily work done by the DCWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464811419285">Mitchell, Zimmerman, &amp; Beeber, 2010</xref>) and providing incentives to participate (such as a meal) are also effective to facilitate reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464811419285">Resnick, Cayo, Galik, &amp; Pretzer-Baboff, 2009</xref>). In addition, we incorporated ongoing educational opportunities at the bedside when working with DCWs in treatment communities. We believe ongoing persistent repetition about FFC had a greater influence on changing behavior among DCWs than the formal in-service session.</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine our reach to families/proxies and other staff within the treatment communities. Although all were invited to attend formal in-service sessions, none of the non-DCW staff attended in-services and family/proxy attendance was low. Additional information about FFC-related activities within the treatment communities was provided in newsletters and we strongly recommend using these and other types of communication methods (e.g., web pages) that are already established within communities to increase reach.</p>
<p>Effectiveness of the intervention was demonstrated, albeit with small improvements. DCWs increased the percentage of FFC provided to residents during routine daily physical activities (e.g., bathing, dressing, going to meals) and residents did not decline functionally in treatment groups as much as they did in control sites. While we hypothesized that FFC-AL would result in maintenance or improvement in function, exposure to FFC-AL at least limited the functional decline commonly noted among AL residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464811419285">Ball et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0733464811419285">Fonda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464811419285">Frytak et al., 2001</xref>). We did, however, increase the number of residents who transitioned from not ambulating a functional distance to regaining the ability to ambulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464811419285">Resnick et al., in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, based on feedback from administration, family, and measurement of beliefs about FFC among the DCWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464811419285">Resnick et al., 2010</xref>), there was no resistance to FFC or to our integration of this type of care into routine care practices. We anticipate that our limited effectiveness may be in part due to the lack of full engagement of our community champion, particularly in the 1st 6 months of the implementation period. As has been shown repeatedly in prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464811419285">Aagaard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464811419285">Berta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0733464811419285">Mitchell, Fisher, Hastings, Silverman &amp; Wallen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0733464811419285">Salvesen,Evenson, Rodriguez, Brown, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0733464811419285">Schnelle et al., 2002</xref>), the champion is critical to successful implementation. It is this individual who remains focused on intervention activities and assures that care practices are provided as intended and that staff receive positive reinforced for implementation.</p>
<p>Although we provided a research-supported FFCN to train and help guide the champion for the 12-month study period, the FFCN was only in the treatment community for a limited period of time. Moreover, our FFCN had no administrative authority over the champion or the DCWs and thus could not recommend corrective measures in the advent that activities associated with FFC-AL were not occurring.</p>
<p>Another challenge to successful dissemination and implementation was the turnover of our champions throughout the course of the intervention. Anticipating the likelihood of staff turnover and transition in long-term care settings, it may be prudent to train multiple champions at the onset of the intervention/implementation process.</p>
<p>For the champion to be sufficiently engaged, however, it requires significant support of leaders within the organization. Prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464811419285">Berta et al, 2010</xref>) has suggested that beyond champions, organization leaders have a critical role to play in the dissemination and implementation of care practices in long-term care settings. Early on in the process, they are helpful in assuring that the care practice is consistent with the facility strategic aims or philosophy. During the implementation process, they are needed to select the most appropriate champion(s) and to support and reinforce the work of those champions. We had some limited success in engaging the administration as demonstrated by implementation of environmental recommendations provided based on findings from Component 1 of FFC-AL. We do not feel, however, that the administrative leaders provided the level of support or reinforcement to the champions for their participation in FFC-AL (e.g., encouraging the champion to work with the FFCN, providing positive reinforcement for involvement in FFC-AL). As per the model of Observed Knowledge Translation Application Process for Clinical Practice Guideline Implementation proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464811419285">Berta et al. (2010)</xref>, we would recommend expanding on Component 1 and in future work meeting with organizational leaders at regular intervals throughout the course of the implementation process. In addition to providing updates on outcomes and progress, we would recommend to administrators and leaders within the organization to provide support for the champion via recognition of work related to implementation. This might include protected time to monitor that resident goals were being appropriately addressed and that they were positively reinforced for evidence of FFC-related activities.</p>
<p>Enactment of FFC is directly related to effectiveness. We used documentation of FFC via a calendar in which DCWs were to document their daily FFC activities per resident. As noted, we demonstrated that only 53% of monthly calendars were completed. Some of this may be because DCWs are generally less familiar with rigorous daily documentation than those who work in nursing home settings. Alternative methods of establishing evidence for enactment of interventions such as FFC are needed that are less burdensome for staff. With increasing use of electronic medical records, for example, it may be possible to force daily documentation using a preestablished form that can quickly be completed.</p>
<p>We were most excited about the evidence of maintenance noticed in treatment communities. Their willingness to alter their environments, marketing materials, and service plans to reflect an FFC philosophy shows a true integration of this philosophy into routine care activities. It is this allocation of resources and ongoing commitment of our internal champions that will assure an enduring aspect of FFC throughout these communities. It also reminds us that any intervention is more likely to be adopted if it is seen to offer a true advantage to the setting and, in the case of AL, FFC was perceived as a value-added program for marketing.</p>

<title>Study Limitations and Conclusion</title>
<p>We appreciate the limited impact of our work with the inclusion of just two treatment communities. In addition we acknowledge that we did not consider the cost of FFC-AL and the impact of cost on residents, AL communities, or the health care system. We recommend that such analysis be completed in future work. Our long-term goal is to use the model provided here to disseminate and implement FFC to a larger number of AL communities and to provide information that others can use when implementing a new innovation in AL. Given the modest nature of this work, ongoing research is needed to continue to consider the ways in which innovative interventions such as FFC are disseminated through AL communities and implemented in routine care. In conclusion, we believe that we had some success in implementation of FFC-AL using the approach delineated. To strengthen dissemination and implementation, we recommend that future work incorporate a more focused inclusion of organizational leaders to engage them in providing support for champions throughout the course of the implementation process.</p>
