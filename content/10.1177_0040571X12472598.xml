<abstract>
<p>The ‘new atheism’ has difficulty distinguishing scientific issues from metaphysical ones. Still many theologians and philosophers have the same difficulty. This paper argues for the necessity of something like what Bernard Lonergan calls ‘intellectual conversion’ to help make this distinction. Drawing on the work of physicist Lawrence Krauss and Augustine’s narrative of his own intellectual conversion, the paper illustrates the confusions that arise when such conversion is lacking, and how such conversion can assist in moving the discussion about science and religion forward.</p>

<p>The rise of the ‘new atheism’ is one of the significant cultural features of our time. Far more militant, vocal and organized than the ‘old atheism’, its supporters regularly wage cyber war on opponents, flooding web sites with often virulent rejoinders to anyone who ventures to offer comment on or criticism of their leading lights, Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040571X12472598">1</xref></sup> If one of the task of theology is, as Lonergan suggests, to mediate between the cultural matrix and the significance and role of religion in that matrix, then this rise poses a particular challenge to the theologian.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040571X12472598">2</xref></sup> How does one mediate the significance and role of religion within a cultural matrix which displays such intellectual hostility to the very existence of God? And perhaps a more challenging question is, what does the rise of atheism have to tell us about how we operate religiously in our current society?</p>
<p>Of course one response would be to ignore their efforts. If anything religion is undergoing a global resurgence and Christianity is growing, particularly in non-Western contexts. If so, atheists could safely be ignored as history overtakes them. Indeed it may well be that this very growth compounds some of their highly charged rhetoric. One gets a sense of frustration that surely in the face of modern science religion should be dying out, not growing in significance. Nonetheless to fail to engage with the new atheists is to reinforce the notion that religious belief is inherently irrational, or merely a matter of private preference, much as one might prefer a colour scheme or a brand of beer. This is to concede too much, to my mind, and it is the task of theology to engage as best it can with the challenges posed by atheism in the name of science.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040571X12472598"><title>Science, religion and natural theology</title>
<p>What is the presenting problem? Of course there are many complaints made against religious belief, but one of the most frequently recurring themes is the incompatibility of religious belief and modern science. Initially fuelled by debates between evolution and creation science (or, more recently, ‘intelligent design’), the debate now encompasses questions of miracles (particularly the virgin birth and the resurrection of Jesus) and cosmology (the Big Bang and ‘quantum gravity’). Evolution and cosmology render God irrelevant in terms of explaining the origins of life and the universe, and the possibility of the miraculous is contrary to all the scientific evidence, they claim. Of course this stance is not assisted by Christians who proclaim the incompatibility of science and religion, in order to reject such scientific knowledge as leading believers astray. Both are then locked in a <italic>danse macarbre</italic> of mutual recrimination.</p>
<p>Traditionally the issues raised here lie within the provenance of ‘natural theology’. This form of theologizing goes back well before the rise of modern science and utilized well-honed skills in metaphysics as found, for example, in Aquinas’s famous ‘five ways’. However, with the rise of modern science and a subsequent loss of metaphysical thinking, much natural theology seemed to take one of two strategies: (1) marvel at the wonder of creation as a reflection of divine creativity and (2) evoke God to ‘fill in the gaps’ left by current scientific explanations.</p>
<p>The first tended to presume rather than establish God’s existence while the second found God’s existence reduced to an ever diminishing horizon, as science marched towards fuller explanation. Michael Buckley has suggested that this second strategy gave birth to modern atheism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040571X12472598">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>There have also been theological objections to natural theology, particularly in Reformed circles. Famously, Karl Barth rejected the Catholic tradition’s <italic>analogia entis</italic> as idolatry and called for an <italic>analogia fidei</italic> to takes its place. On Barth’s reading, philosophical and metaphysical reason could not be trusted to know God; it could only result in a false god and idolatrous knowledge. Something of this Reformed legacy can be seen in the recent work of Alister McGrath, whose book, <italic>The Open Secret</italic>, seeks to develop an explicitly Christian ‘natural theology’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040571X12472598">4</xref></sup> McGrath draws on Christian sources and resources to seek to demonstrate the reasonableness of belief through a form of internal consistency and consistency with the scientific and other evidence. While laudable in itself and capable of providing reassurance to believers, one might question whether it addresses the specific context created by the new atheists.</p>
<p>Here, one might draw a distinction between McGrath’s ‘Christian natural theology’ and what I would call a ‘natural theology within the Christian tradition’. The latter might draw upon well-worn themes and questions raised by prior efforts in natural theology by Christian theologians, while still seeking to prescind from explicitly Christian beliefs or authoritative sources in mounting one’s case. It appeals to reason, or perhaps more correctly to <italic>reasoning</italic>, because differing conceptions of reason itself may be part of the problem. And so if one presumes that scientific forms of reason constitute the only valid forms of reason then such presumptions may need to be shaken loose; but the very act of shaking loose may appeal to a process of reasoning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040571X12472598">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>And this is the problem we face. Traditional forms of reasoning in natural theology are metaphysical, but the dominance of science as the preeminent form of reason has obscured, if not altogether eliminated, any possible distinction between science and metaphysics. Of course this is a pervasive problem, one to which many theologians, let alone scientists, would have difficulty articulating a solution. Nevertheless, Christian theologians can begin to ‘shake loose’ the assumptions, concepts and arguments which have given the debate the contours it has. If those assumptions, concepts and arguments are less secure than otherwise thought, the theologian does not necessarily win the debate but might shift it to new grounds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040571X12472598"><title>Physics or metaphysics: a recent example</title>
<p>The problem is well illustrated in a book by one of the new atheists, Lawrence Krauss. In his book, <italic>A Universe from Nothing</italic>, he claims that science is well on the way to explaining how the universe emerges from ‘nothing’ thus eliminating any need for a creator God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040571X12472598">6</xref></sup> As Krauss notes, much hangs on what we mean by nothing. His barbs at philosophers and theologians refer to their imprecision in regard to the meaning of ‘nothing’. He, in contrast, has a perfectly clear understanding of what he means by nothing. As he often repeats, nothing means ‘empty space’. Indeed, ‘“Nothing” is every bit as physical as “something”, especially if it is to be defined as the “absence of something”.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040571X12472598">7</xref></sup> The failure of philosophers and theologians to realize this indicates the ‘intellectual bankruptcy’ of ‘much of modern theology and some modern philosophy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040571X12472598">8</xref></sup> He notes, ‘By <italic>nothing</italic> I do not mean nothing, but rather <italic>nothing</italic> – in this case, the nothingness we normally call empty space.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040571X12472598">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>What comes through is that real things are things ‘in’ space and time, subatomic particles, even virtual particles, fields such as electromagnetic and gravitational fields and so on. Indeed I do not dispute the reality of any of these, even virtual particles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040571X12472598">10</xref></sup> But I would ask about the reality of space itself. Is space ‘real’ and does it constitute ‘something’ rather than ‘nothing’? If space is indeed ‘something’ then his argument that something comes from nothing (‘empty space’) is itself empty. Indeed even Krauss admits, ‘I assume space exists’, so it is clearly not nothing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040571X12472598">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Much of Krauss’s energy is expended telling us that ‘nothing [i.e., empty space] is not nothing’ at all,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040571X12472598">12</xref></sup> but a seething undercurrent of virtual particles which can ‘pop’ into real existence through their interaction with powerful fields, something Stephen Hawking proposed in relation to the gravitation field around black holes in the 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040571X12472598">13</xref></sup> Scientifically this may well be correct. It clearly does not address the metaphysical question of whether something can come from nothing, however, but tells us how some things can come from something else (i.e., from empty space, which is not really empty at all).</p>
<p>We can witness here a number of confusions operating in Krauss’s conception of ‘nothing’. Nothing is not defined as the absence of existence or being, but as the emptiness of space and time. But at the same time, space ‘exists’. The ontological status of space is then unresolved for Krauss. On the one hand, existence (being ‘something’) occurs within space; on the other hand, space exists. Because space is actually never empty, even ‘nothing is something’. Krauss is in a metaphysical muddle, but seems completely unaware of the fact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040571X12472598"><title>Not a new problem: Augustine’s intellectual conversion</title>
<p>This problem is one which is not new to the Christian tradition. Augustine identifies himself as falling into the same problem prior to his conversion to Christianity, and indeed it was an impediment to his conversion. Augustine begins Book 7 of <italic>The Confessions</italic> with a clear signal as to the main issue he wishes to address. In its opening paragraph he draws attention to his major intellectual difficulty in coming to faith. ‘I was unable to grasp the idea of substance except as something we can see with our bodily eyes.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040571X12472598">14</xref></sup> This is having a particular impact on his ability to conceive of God as other than a body: ‘I was still forced to imagine something corporeal spread out in space, whether infused into the world or even diffused through the infinity outside it … because anything to which I denied these spatial dimensions seemed to me to be nothing at all’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040571X12472598">15</xref></sup> Augustine reinforces this conception of God in a passage which begins:<disp-quote>
<p>Hence I thought that even you, Life of my life, were a vast reality spread throughout space in every direction: I thought that you penetrated the whole mass of the earth and the immense, unbounded spaces beyond it on all sides, that earth, sky, and all things were full of you, and that they found their limits in you, while you yourself had no limit anywhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040571X12472598">16</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In terms Lonergan develops in <italic>Insight</italic>, both Augustine and Krauss are caught in a notion of reality as ‘already out there now’, a reality conditioned by space and time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040571X12472598">17</xref></sup> Lonergan refers to this conception of reality as based on an ‘animal’ knowing, on extroverted biologically dominated consciousness. He distinguishes it from a <italic>fully human</italic> knowing based on intelligence and reason. He argues that many philosophical difficulties arise because of a failure to distinguish between these two forms of knowing. This distinction can help us identify why Krauss is confused about the ontological status of space. Our ‘animal’ knowing identifies ‘reality’ as an ‘already out there now’ of things, particles, fields and so on, ‘in’ space and time. Our genuine fully human knowing, in contrast, knows that space exists because it is intelligent and reasonable for us to affirm its existence.</p>
<p>Unlike Krauss, Augustine makes a transition from one position to the other. Indeed Book 7 of <italic>Confessions</italic> is the narrative of that transition. Augustine begins the transition with the story of a conversation with Nebridius, concerning the Manichean belief in a cosmic conflict between powers of darkness and God. Nebridius raises the question, ‘[W]hat would they have done to you [God] if you had refused to fight?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040571X12472598">18</xref></sup> In raising this question he shows that no possible answer makes any sense; they are all equally unreasonable. However, from the point of view of the unfolding argument within the narrative, what Augustine is presenting is an alternative criterion for reality from his previous naïve position. Nebridius is presenting a reasoned argument against the Manicheans. He demonstrates through argument that their position is rationally incoherent and so the realities they posit are nothing but fables and myths. Rather than the criterion of extroverted consciousness leading the way, the argument of Nebridius turns our attention to a reality based on reason. Later on in the chapter this transition will be realized in Augustine through his reading of the ‘Platonists’ which mediate a shift from materiality to a more ‘spiritual’ understanding of reality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040571X12472598">19</xref></sup> Rather than taking materiality as the paradigm for what is real, platonic doctrine views materiality as more ephemeral, more insubstantial, than the reality of truth perceived intellectually. Through his reading of the Platonists the shift foreshadowed in his juxtaposition of his fixation on corporeality and the reasoned argument of Nebridius begins to establish itself in his own thinking.</p>
<p>And so Augustine still talks about light, but now an ‘incommutable light … not this common [visible] light at all, but something different … Anyone who knows truth knows it, and whoever knows it knows eternity … Love knows it.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040571X12472598">20</xref></sup> God is then referred to as ‘eternal Truth’ whose reality cannot be doubted. ‘Is truth then a nothing, simply because it is not spread out through space, either finite or infinite?’ The reality of truth is now as real to Augustine as his own existence: ‘no possibility of doubt remained in me; I could more easily have doubted that I was alive than that truth exists, truth that is seen and understood through things that are made’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040571X12472598">21</xref></sup> Much here depends on how one reads the conjunction ‘and’. Is Augustine positing here two truths, one seen, the other understood? Or is there one truth which is ‘seen and understood’ through created reality? Clearly the direction Augustine is taking his readers in is the latter. Indeed in a complete inversion of our normal orientation to the ‘already-out-there-now’ real, God is what is most real, while created material realities ‘do not in the fullest sense exist … they are real because they are from you, but unreal inasmuch as they are not what you are’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040571X12472598">22</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040571X12472598"><title>Reaching for the mind of God</title>
<p>Krauss is of course far from making such a transition, but one can draw out from his position elements which might help. There is his adherence to the intelligence and reasonableness of science. Of its own dynamics this intelligence and reasonableness transcend the limitations Krauss places on it by restricting its reach to material objects ‘in’ space and time. As if sensing the problem with his position, and acknowledging that empty space-time is not what theologians and philosophers mean by nothing, Krauss is forced to push the argument further, and evokes as yet untested and incomplete theories of quantum gravitation.<disp-quote>
<p>As I have defined it thus far, the relevant “nothing” from which our observed “something” arises is “empty space.” However, once we allow for the merging of quantum mechanics and general relativity, we can extend this argument to the case where space itself is forced into existence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040571X12472598">23</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This is getting closer to what philosophers and theologians mean by ‘nothing’, except for the question of the status of these physical laws themselves. Does this supposed ‘merging of quantum mechanics and general relativity’ exist? Certainly not in the mind of any living physicist at the moment, this being a holy grail in modern physics. Can there be physical laws which explain the existence of physical reality if there is no physical reality? If no, then they cannot be evoked to explain that physical reality. If yes, what is the nature of the existence of these laws? The ontological status of such laws is not addressed by Krauss.</p>
<p>Suppose we were to postulate the existence of such laws independent of the physical reality they seek to express. What sort of existence would they have? We know from the experience of science that those who discover such laws often require brilliant intelligence. These laws as human creations exist primarily in the minds of our best physicists, and only secondarily in physics textbooks and research papers. In our experience it is intelligence which produces an intelligibility so profound that it describes the universe. If such laws ‘produce’ the universe, they do so because they are held in a being intelligent enough to grasp the possibility of such laws and powerful enough to move from the possibility to the reality. At this stage Aquinas might well say, ‘and this all people call God’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0040571X12472598">24</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040571X12472598" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>So far I have prescinded from drawing on elements of the Christian tradition as authoritative. The use of Augustine is illustrative of the problem and its possible solution, but still the problem is philosophical rather than theological. The issue at stake is what Lonergan calls ‘intellectual conversion’, its presence or absence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0040571X12472598">25</xref></sup> It revolves around criteria for reality and the congruence between intelligence and existence. Nonetheless the outcome would come as no surprise to Christian theology. In the Prologue to John’s Gospel we read that ‘in the beginning was the Word’ and that through this Word, ‘all things came to be’. This Word of God is not the dumb utterance of an animal grunting; nor the mere repetition of sound, like a parrot saying, ‘Polly wants a cracker’, not knowing who Polly is, or what a cracker is, or what it means to want something. The Word that God utters, the Word which is nothing less than God, is a meaning-full Word, a divinely intelligent Word which speaks forth a universe rich in intelligibility. Science presumes this intelligibility; it is the condition for its very possibility. Science rejoices in it, but it does not create it. Scientist and natural philosopher Paul Davies grasps the point well:<disp-quote>
<p>Science is founded on the notion of the rationality and logicality of nature. The universe is ordered in a meaningful way, and scientists seek reasons for why things are the way they are. If the universe as a whole is pointless, then it exists reasonlessly. In other words, it is ultimately arbitrary and absurd. We are then invited to contemplate a state of affairs in which all scientific chains of reasoning are grounded in absurdity. The order of the world would have no foundation and its breathtaking rationality would have to spring, miraculously, from absurdity. So Weinberg’s dictum is neatly turned on its head: the more the universe seems pointless, the more it seems incomprehensible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0040571X12472598">26</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Of course Davies is not suggesting that the universe is absurd. He is suggesting that if the universe has no source in intelligence (God), then the success of science is incomprehensible. If this is the case then the ‘presenting problem’ of the incompatibility of science and religion is a mere phantom, the product of those who have failed to recognize the distinction between science and metaphysics, presuming that science is the only valid form of reasoning. This is an assumption that needs shaking loose, and one step towards this goal is for theologians and scientists to face the same issue with which Augustine dealt so long ago, shifting his criteria of reality from mere looking at the already-out-there-now real of extroverted consciousness to the full human reality known intelligently and reasonably.</p>
