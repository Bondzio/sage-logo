<abstract>
<p>Adult male circumcision has been shown to reduce the transmission of HIV. Women’s acceptability of male circumcision is important in Papua New Guinea’s preparedness to introduce male circumcision, and in ethical considerations of its use as a biomedical technology for HIV prevention. We conducted 21 focus group discussions and 18 in-depth interviews with women in all four regions of Papua New Guinea. The majority of women objected to the introduction of male circumcision for three main reasons: circumcision would result in sexual risk compensation; circumcision goes against Christian faith; and circumcision is a new practice that is culturally inappropriate. A minority of women accepted male circumcision for the prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, and for the benefit of penile hygiene and health. Women’s objections to circumcision as a biomedical method of preventing HIV reemphasize the importance of sociocultural and behavioral interventions in Papua New Guinea.</p>

<body>
<p>Three large-scale Phase III clinical trials in Africa have shown that male circumcision has a protective efficacy of around 60% in preventing vaginally acquired <italic>HIV</italic> in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312467234">Auvert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312467234">Bailey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312467234">Gray et al., 2007</xref>). The results of these trials confirmed longstanding observational studies that previously indicated that circumcision was partially protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732312467234">Siegfried, Muller, Deeks, &amp; Volmink, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1049732312467234">Weiss, Quigley, &amp; Hayes, 2000</xref>), thus attracting renewed and unprecedented interest in adult medical male circumcision for HIV prevention. Subsequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) issued a joint statement in March, 2007 which recommended male circumcision as an essential component of comprehensive HIV prevention in high-prevalence settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1049732312467234">WHO &amp; UNAIDS, 2007</xref>). In 2011, UNAIDS called for the scaling up of voluntary male circumcision for men aged 15 years and over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312467234">UNAIDS, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>These clinical trial results and the subsequent attempts to scale up male circumcision as a biomedical intervention have not been uncritically accepted in the field of HIV prevention, particularly among social researchers who are concerned with the role of gender, culture, and the notion of evidence used to propagate circumcision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312467234">Aggleton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312467234">Dowsett &amp; Couch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312467234">Hankins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312467234">Kippax, 2008</xref>). Some have suggested that a more cautious approach be undertaken on the grounds that in many communities, complex cultural, ethical, medical, and strategic issues need to be addressed before male circumcision as a biomedical technology can be rolled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312467234">Muula, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312467234">Peltzer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049732312467234">Sawires et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1049732312467234">Westercamp and Bailey (2007)</xref> reviewed 13 studies that investigated the acceptability of male circumcision for HIV prevention in nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa, of which 10 studies included women. The systematic review showed 69% of women favored their male partner to be circumcised, and 81% were willing to circumcise their son. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312467234">Bailey, Muga, Poulussen, and Abicht (2002)</xref> argued that women’s views on male circumcision might be powerful in influencing decisions regarding male circumcision among Luo men in western Kenya, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732312467234">Scott, Weiss, and Viljoen (2005)</xref> suggested that women would not be powerful in Zulu men’s decision making. In India, the majority of mothers (81%) with uncircumcised sons indicated that they would have their sons circumcised, but more than half (58%) indicted that the sole decision to circumcise their sons rested with their sons’ father (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312467234">Madhivanan et al., 2008</xref>). According to some researchers, women’s views might be significant in determining how health-promotion materials are targeted; for example, the design of male circumcision health-promotion material targeting uncircumcised men could draw on women’s beliefs that they would enjoy sex more with circumcised men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312467234">Bailey et al., 2002</xref>; Scott et al.).</p>
<p>Biomedical technologies are neither ethically nor morally neutral, and as a technology that is designed to facilitate human interventions in the function of the body and in health and illness, they, by their very nature, change who we are and as a result the world in which we live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312467234">Lock &amp; Nguyen, 2010</xref>). Male circumcision, while changing the male body, has the potential to radically alter society, including the lives of women. Increasing emphasis is being placed on understanding the cultural context of biomedical interventions generally, as evident in the seminal work of Lock and Nguyen, and specifically in relation to HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312467234">Kippax &amp; Stephenson, 2012</xref>). Leading social researchers in the field of HIV prevention have recently published on the often tenuous and complex relationship that exists between biomedical HIV prevention and prevention which is usually referred to as behavioral. Rather than reinforcing the distinctions that are often made between the aforementioned approaches to HIV prevention, Kippax and Stephenson stated that “all HIV prevention interventions must engage with the everyday lives of people and be integrated into the social relations and social practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312467234">2012</xref>, p. 789).</p>
<p>Unlike other forms of biomedical technology and behavior-change strategies, male circumcision does not require sustained change, as is required, for example, with condom use or treatment adherence. However, the success of male circumcision relies on relationships between people. As Kippax and Stephenson themselves argued, “Effective prevention requires addressing the relationships between people, [HIV], treatment drugs, biomedical, and other prevention technologies and other efforts to reduce risk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312467234">2012</xref>, p. 791). These critiques of biomedicine, and in particular the relationship between the social, biomedical, and structural, informed how we approached this study and subsequently the analysis of data.</p>
<p>Gender disparities and gender-based power have long been recognized as driving forces of the HIV epidemic, and as such gender must be central to all aspects of the response to HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312467234">Eves, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312467234">Hankins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1049732312467234">United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women, 2000</xref>), including biomedical prevention responses such as male circumcision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1049732312467234">Weiss, Hankins, &amp; Dickson, 2009</xref>). However, gender has frequently come to stand for women at the exclusion of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312467234">Barker &amp; Ricardo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312467234">Eves, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312467234">Mane &amp; Aggleton, 2001</xref>). This has shifted with the focus on male circumcision. Men have rightly been central to policy, programming, and research on male circumcision; however, the potential impacts on women and their perspectives of male circumcision as a biomedical technology must be considered and included so as to understand the cultural and moral context of male circumcision in Papua New Guinea. This article is framed by a sociocultural understanding of biomedicine, gender relations in Papua New Guinea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312467234">Eves, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312467234">Herdt, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312467234">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312467234">Strathern, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1049732312467234">Wilde, 2007</xref>), and the cultural beliefs of contagion and risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312467234">Douglas, 1966/1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049732312467234">Stewart &amp; Strathern, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea has the highest HIV prevalence in the Asia-Pacific region outside of Thailand, with an estimated HIV prevalence of less than 1% in adults aged 15 to 49 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312467234">Papua New Guinea National AIDS Council Secretariat, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312467234">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732312467234">Papua New Guinea National Department of Health, 2012</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732312467234">1</xref></sup> The social position of women is lower than that of men in most parts of the country, and they face high levels of violence, including sexual violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312467234">Amnesty International, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312467234">Australian Agency for International Development, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312467234">National Sex and Reproduction Research Team &amp; Jenkins, 1994</xref>). Strong gender divisions characterize the country, and these inequalities between men and women are an everyday aspect of social life. As a consequence, women in Papua New Guinea are frequently disempowered in negotiations around sex, particularly safe sex. These conditions of male dominance have raised the concern that women’s beliefs do not necessarily influence the practices of men. Nevertheless, it is critical to involve women in debates, research, and policy decisions regarding health and HIV prevention, including the possible role of male circumcision.</p>
<p>Women are at high risk of HIV infection in high-prevalence, heterosexually driven epidemics. Women’s risk of acquiring HIV is dependent on three factors: rates of new sexual partnership formation, HIV prevalence among women’s male sexual partners, and the probability of being infected on sexual exposure to an HIV-positive male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1049732312467234">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, women’s role in male circumcision debates is more than as mothers, but also as sexual partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312467234">Hankins, 2007</xref>). That said, there is little evidence that male circumcision directly reduces a woman’s risk of acquiring HIV through sex with an infected circumcised male partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1049732312467234">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Few researchers have reported solely on the acceptability of male circumcision for HIV prevention among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312467234">Castro-Vasquez, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312467234">Madhivanan et al., 2008</xref>), even though it has important implications for women as parents and sexual partners in the appropriate and ethical application of circumcision as an HIV prevention method. Papua New Guinea is currently considering male circumcision as an additional HIV prevention measure to stem a heterosexually driven and heterogeneous HIV epidemic. The aim of the larger study from which this article is drawn was to map current penile practices and their sociocultural meanings in Papua New Guinea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312467234">Hill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312467234">Kelly, Kupul, Aeno, et al., 2012</xref>) and to examine the notional acceptability of male circumcision for HIV prevention among both men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312467234">Kelly, Kupul, Fitzgerald, et al., 2012</xref>) and women. In this article we examine Papua New Guinean women’s notional acceptability of male circumcision as a form of biomedical technology.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>We undertook a qualitative study using focus groups and in-depth interviews between January and June 2009 in four provinces, each representing one of the four socially and geographically diverse regions of the country: National Capital District, Eastern Highlands Province, East Sepik Province, and West New Britain Province. The National Capital District is the capital of Papua New Guinea, a cosmopolitan city with large in-migration from all regions of the country and beyond, creating a melting pot of diversity of peoples and practices. Eastern Highlands Province is considered a nontraditional, penile-cutting cultural area, where there is no customary practice of circumcision but which is linked with major areas of the country through the Highlands Highway. East Sepik Province and West New Britain Province have anthropologically documented traditional (customary) penile-cutting practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312467234">Hogbin, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312467234">Newman &amp; Boyd, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1049732312467234">Tuzin, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1049732312467234">1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1049732312467234">Williamson, 1990</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049732312467234">2</xref></sup> which are known in <italic>Tok Pisin</italic>, a lingua franca of Papua New Guinea, as <italic>katim kok</italic>.</p>
<p>We used a purposive sampling technique to identify potential study participants following initial contact and interviews with key local stakeholders and community members at each study location. Women in this study were purposely diverse. We drew women from all four study sites, each representing a different region of the country to ensure a qualitative study of this kind to speak of women in the broadest sense. As indicative of the country, the educational background of women was diverse, with the majority of them not having completed secondary school, and a minority in formal employment and having gained tertiary qualifications.</p>
<p>We recruited women through villages, settlements and towns, church groups, peer-support groups for people living with HIV and who sell sex, schools, universities, and workplaces. Some women were from nontraditional circumcising communities, whereas others were from cultures that practiced forms of penile modification during the initiation of their young males. Furthermore, some women were from matrilineal communities, and the remaining majority of women were drawn from patrilineal communities. Although participants were drawn from the capitals of each province, we traveled outward to more remote areas, with the most remote village approximately a 5-hour drive away, followed by another hour of motorized canoe travel from the capital town.</p>
<p>We conducted 21 focus group discussions and 18 semistructured interviews with women across the four research areas; in total, 210 women participated in the study. The domains of interest for the semistructured and focus group discussions were the same and thus appropriate to be analyzed together. Although the number of focus group discussions was large in comparison with other studies, we agreed that to reflect the beliefs of as many women as possible we needed to ensure data saturation across the country and not in just one region. We reached data saturation in both focus group discussions and the interviews. The focus group discussions ranged in size but included no more than 14 participants and lasted up to 2 hours, whereas the semistructured interviews lasted on average less than 1 hour. More focus group discussions were undertaken in East Sepik Province because it is the only province in the country conducting a male circumcision program (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312467234">Table 1</xref> for a breakdown of women’s participation by province and interview type). The women who participated in semistructured interviews did not participate in focus group discussions. The women were selected for interviews based on several factors, including their need for privacy (such as HIV-positive women) and their level of knowledge of male circumcision (such as traditional, contemporary, and medical circumcision).</p>

<p>The majority of the women in the study were recruited from nontraditional penile-cutting areas (151/210); therefore, it is not surprising that slightly less than this proportion (145/210) had not previously heard of penile cutting, irrespective of its purpose. Only 26 of the women in the study had heard of male circumcision as a method for the prevention of HIV acquisition in men, and of these women, most were well informed. Comparatively, most of the women had good knowledge of how HIV is transmitted, particularly sexually.</p>
<p>We provided a basic overview of the research evidence from the African trials at the beginning of each of the interviews and focus group discussions, for women of all educational and knowledge levels to participate in this study and to form an opinion regarding the acceptability of male circumcision for HIV prevention. Rather than burdening the women with too much technical detail on the clinical trials in Africa, we summarized the key findings for them: that male circumcision provides men with partial protection (around 60%) during vaginal sex with a woman, but that it does not protect women from being infected through sex with an HIV-positive circumcised male. We answered all questions that arose from the women, both during and after interviews and focus group discussions, and when appropriate, provided basic biological information regarding the structure of the penis and the foreskin. In one focus group discussion, a researcher used a banana to demonstrate the difference between the penis (banana) and the foreskin (banana skin), and that the penis remains when the foreskin is removed, as suggested by male circumcision for HIV prevention.</p>
<p>The women were interviewed by one of two of our female Papua New Guinean researchers in culturally appropriate spaces including church halls, under trees, in community meeting areas, and in people’s homes. All of the interviews and focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated from Tok Pisin to English, and thematically analyzed by our research team. A team of five researchers designed a coding framework and all transcripts were double coded using a grounded theory approach, as first emphasized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312467234">Glaser and Strauss (1967)</xref>. In situations in which a discrepancy in coding occurred, a third researcher reviewed the transcript and allocated a code. We removed all identifiable information and allocated pseudonyms to the participants.</p>
<p>Ethical approval was obtained by our research team in Papua New Guinea from the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research Internal Review Board, the Medical Research Advisory Committee of Papua New Guinea, and the Research Advisory Committee of the Papua New Guinea National AIDS Council. In Australia we sought ethics approval from the Human Research Ethics Committees of the University of Queensland and the University of New South Wales. All women were aged 16 years and older and provided written informed consent in either English or Tok Pisin.

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Overall, the majority of the women who participated in the study objected to the idea of the Papua New Guinea government introducing male circumcision for HIV prevention. As our findings detail, this was not because women were not interested in preventing the transmission of HIV in men, but rather they held grave concerns about the potential impacts of such a technology on the lives of both men and women. Only a minority of the women who were well educated and involved in HIV prevention work, and therefore potentially more assertive in their own lives, supported the introduction of male circumcision.</p>
<sec id="section3-1049732312467234">
<title>Nonacceptance of Male Circumcision</title>
<p>We found three primary reasons explaining women’s objections to the introduction of circumcision as a biomedical HIV prevention method in Papua New Guinea. The first of these was that male circumcision would result in sexual risk compensation, followed by a concern that such a practice was incongruent with Christianity, and finally, that circumcision was not culturally appropriate.</p>
<sec id="section4-1049732312467234">
<title>Male circumcision would result in sexual risk compensation</title>
<p>Of the majority of women who were against the notional introduction of male circumcision, almost all were against its introduction because they feared men would develop a “false sense of security” whereby they would reduce their likelihood of using measures that are mutually protective, such as condoms, and having one faithful and uninfected partner. Even though the women phrased their concerns about possible behavioral changes postcircumcision as false, this belief is not entirely correct because male circumcision does reduce risk, albeit not completely. Women’s description of a false sense of security has been defined in the literature as “sexual risk compensation,” wherein individuals modify their risk behavior in response to real or perceived changes in risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732312467234">Riess, Achieng, Otieno, Ndinya-Achola, &amp; Bailey, 2010</xref>). According to the women’s narratives, any behavioral modifications that might result from circumcision would ultimately lead to tensions both in the community and within relationships.</p>
<p>Many women suggested that circumcised men would no longer fear acquiring HIV from having multiple partners: “After [men] cut off their foreskin they would want to sleep with many women.” The women described to us that men would seek to engage in sexual relations with <italic>pamuk meris</italic> (prostitutes) rather than their wives: “Like once they go and cut it already, this will make them be unfaithful to their partners and they can have sex with ladies along the road they find.” The women highlighted the Christian values that dominate life in Papua New Guinea when they spoke of men becoming “promiscuous” if they underwent male circumcision: “If he cuts his skin he will not think of his wife. . . . He will only think of being promiscuous and will go around.”</p>
<p>Some of the women believed that fear plays a determining role in men’s sexual behaviors. Many of the women raised the concern that once circumcised, men would believe they were totally protected against acquiring HIV. Therefore, any fear that men once had of contagion would be removed and they would be free to behave in different ways:
<disp-quote>
<p>When they cut their skin they will think that “Ah, they cut my skin already, yeah, I won’t get sick.”</p>
<p>He removes the foreskin of his penis already, he won’t think of getting <italic>sikAIDS</italic> [a Tok Pisin term which can refer to both HIV and AIDS]. He won’t be scared of sikAIDS; he will sell his body and roam around.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A number of the women spoke about the potential for men to want to test the efficacy of the penile cut: “After he circumcises his foreskin, he will try to have sex with all the women to test this power from what he did.” This concern among the women—that men would believe they were safe from acquiring HIV and seek to test the efficacy of their surgery—could result in two counterproductive and related behaviors for the prevention of the sexual transmission of HIV. The women thought that men would seek more sexual partners, thus leading to concurrent and multiple sexual partnerships:
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel that all of them will go wild if they cut. Their sex drive will be at a very high state . . . the ones who aren’t circumcised, they will not think about sex as soon as they see a woman. The ones who are circumcised, every time they’re near a woman they’ll feel like they want to have sex right there on the spot . . . they want to sleep with women and they go find sickness. . . . Regarding his body, it will be good to clean his skin and this, but with regard to going around with women and these, we are giving them more strength to do the same.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the women attributed this possible increase in sexual partners to risk compensation, many of them also suggested the physical change to the penis would also play a role. The removal of the foreskin would expose the penis, thus increasing sexual arousal. The women in this study indicated that desire and arousal were biologically driven rather than a cultural ideology of sexual attraction and desire being psychologically or culturally driven. The women were open about their sexual experiences with men who had undergone penile cuts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1049732312467234">3</xref></sup> They reported that these men had higher sex drives, were more easily aroused, and sexually adventurous.</p>
<p>Many women in the study described what they foresaw as an increase in marital issues because of men’s increased sexual arousal and changed sexual behavior postcircumcision. Marital problems would ensue as a result of wives becoming jealous of other women with whom their husbands had sex, including the taking of more wives; this could potentially result in wives arguing and fighting with their husbands or among themselves. Many of the women feared that violence would develop and cause conflict and tension in marriages as a result of jealousy. Male circumcision could exacerbate sexual antagonism, which is already widespread in Papua New Guinea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732312467234">Poole &amp; Herdt, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312467234">Strathern, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Many women, especially younger women and students, feared that men would no longer use condoms, therefore mitigating any protective factors that such a technology could have: “They cut their foreskin so they will not use a condom.” Reportedly, men generally preferred “skin-to-skin” or “flesh-to-flesh” sex, so male circumcision would empower men to argue against the need to use condoms: “They will say, ‘No condom, flesh to flesh, <italic>Mama</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1049732312467234">4</xref></sup> I cut my skin already, yeah.’” A woman living with HIV provided another example of this when she said she was concerned that women would be additionally disempowered to negotiate the use of condoms in an already male-dominated society. She stated that in response to a woman’s request to use a condom a man would reply, “What’s the point of circumcising my foreskin? I was wasting my time cutting my foreskin.”</p>
<p>Even though the clinical trials indicate that male circumcision offers only partial protection, the women interviewed feared that men would misappropriate that knowledge in practice. Alternatively, it might mean that women feared that men would not understand that circumcision only provides partial protection. Another woman living with HIV explained that men’s thoughts are “very strong,” and although she would personally not wish to risk infecting a male partner and try to insist on using a condom, she said that “if his mind is strongly made up, then I’d stay with him [without using a condom].” However, it is important to note that it was predominately HIV-positive women and female sex workers who argued that they thought men’s condom use would remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Most women feared that circumcision would lead to increased transmission of HIV rather than the opposite because of their perceived reduction in condom use and an increase in sexual partners postcircumcision. One woman shared this concern:
<disp-quote>
<p>If male circumcision was carried out in Papua New Guinea, they’d probably ignore the ABC<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1049732312467234">5</xref></sup> . . . ’cause they’ll probably have [a] false sense of security . . . and just stick to the male circumcision, and they’ll still ignore the percentages, forty percent still getting infected, which could cause high rise again in HIV.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For some of the women, the introduction of male circumcision would be no different from the condom in its impact on sexual risk compensation; thus, they objected to both condoms and male circumcision as methods for HIV prevention:
<disp-quote>
<p>When the condom was first introduced, they have freedom to do it anywhere. When they want to implement [circumcision] again now, it will be another thing.</p>
<p>We see the arrival of circumcision and condom . . . was given to many people and they thought its safe and promiscuous behavior is going very high. And this idea of circumcision also, when they cut their skin they will think that, “Ah, they cut my skin already, yeah. I won’t get sick.” It will increase further, similarly like when condom came and like they said now, “AIDS is a bush fire.” When they also cut the skin, AIDS will continue to [spread like] bush fire. I don’t think it will stop AIDS. . . . We call Papua New Guinea a Christian country, so the government must come up with some kind of measure that will discontinue condom use and discontinue these things, too; forget circumcision, too.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another area of potential risk compensation that concerned the women was the fear that such a technology would provide men with a license for sexual violence. No longer fearing HIV and increased sexual arousal could result in men raping women and girls, including wives: “They can carry you away and rape you with their other friends. . . . They feel free that if they want to, it’s free for them.” “The circumcised man, yeah, that’s like their penis would be erected and that’s like they want to have sex more frequently. And when he controls himself, it’s okay; if not, his wife will have a really tough time.”</p>

<sec id="section5-1049732312467234">
<title>Male circumcision goes against Christian beliefs</title>
<p>Religious beliefs play an important determining role in the acceptability of male circumcision, as indicated in the international literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312467234">Auvert et al., 2005</xref>). Religious beliefs were the second most common reason for the women objecting to the notional idea of male circumcision. This is not surprising considering the dominance of Christianity, including how such values frame the responses to and beliefs about the HIV epidemic in Papua New Guinea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312467234">Eves, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312467234">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312467234">Kelly, 2009</xref>). The majority of the women who expressed a religious objection to this prevention method were older women from the Eastern Highlands and East Sepik Provinces and younger women from the National Capital District.</p>
<p>The women in this study drew on their largely Pentecostal, born-again Christian interpretations of the Bible to argue against male circumcision, rather than the extensive documentation of biblical circumcision and its importance in establishing God’s covenant to create Abrahamic monotheism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049732312467234">Silverman, 2004</xref>). In these Pentecostal interpretations, the Holy Spirit comes to inhabit the body of a born-again Christian through Christian conversion, and is thus transformed into a temple of worship. This conversion requires a particular kind of asceticism, achieved through the absence of “profane use” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312467234">Asamoah-Gyadu, 2009</xref>) of alcohol and other “impure” substances such as betel nuts. Penile modification, including male circumcision, would be in breach of such an aspiration for the uncontaminated body. Male circumcision is a profane use that would be “destroying God’s creation” and “destroying God’s image.” It was also described as “against God’s law” and thus “destroying God’s plan”:
<disp-quote>
<p>God doesn’t want us to spoil our body, and we the people from the earth are doing that. We come up with this idea [of male circumcision] and we’re trying to spoil his plan. So in my opinion, according to the church, it’s against the law of God to damage our body.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A number of the women who objected to circumcision on the grounds of religion made reference to biblical figures such as Adam who were not circumcised, to explain their belief that government policy and programs should “leave God’s creation alone.” The women argued that God did not circumcise Adam, and that there is no instruction in the New Testament for men to be circumcised: “For myself, I won’t let him do this practice because when God created him, he did not tell him to cut a part of his body.”</p>
<p>Other women drew on a different religious framework for not accepting male circumcision. They believed that circumcision could not prevent infection, but faith in God could. Faith was believed to be protective if men were practicing Christians and therefore abstaining from sex, or only having one partner—namely a married spouse. These women insisted that only faith in God could help reduce HIV; other prevention methods would not work. Biomedical interventions such as male circumcision would divert people’s focus away from God:
<disp-quote>
<p>They must not cut it. If they’re thinking of that, they’re not thinking of God. And it’s God’s temple they’re spoiling. They are spoiling it and making it dirty, and they get sexually transmitted infections, and they will soon die. And so being promiscuous they die like that, and so the people must stop it. . . . If you believe God, you won’t cut your skin.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These Christian discourses of prevention placed faithfulness to one partner and God as the means by which to prevent infection, and not circumcision, because circumcision would in fact promote promiscuity. This approach to prevention is similarly drawn on by many Christians in Papua New Guinea, and put forward in the case against condoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312467234">Kelly, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312467234">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-1049732312467234">
<title>Male circumcision is culturally inappropriate</title>
<p>In Papua New Guinea today there are two cultural forms of penile modification; one is more widespread than the other. The vibrant and seemingly expanding contemporary, noncustomary culture of penile practices appears to be evident in all parts of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312467234">Aruwafu, Kupe, &amp; Akuani, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312467234">Kelly, Kupul, Aeno, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312467234">Law &amp; Dinnen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312467234">Millan, Yeka, Obiero, &amp; Pantumari, 2007</xref>), but the long history of customary penile cutting and bloodletting practices is limited to a few cultural groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312467234">Hogbin, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1049732312467234">Tuzin, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1049732312467234">1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1049732312467234">Williamson, 1990</xref>). The majority of the women, irrespective of whether they were from customary cutting cultures or not, argued that circumcision was not culturally acceptable for HIV prevention. Most women described the cutting of the penis generally, and male circumcision specifically, as a new and indeed culturally inappropriate phenomenon, albeit for different cultural reasons. This is in contrast to other findings, which have suggested a shift in acceptance from traditional circumcision to male circumcision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1049732312467234">Wambura et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In West New Britain Province, customary penile practices and associated practices continue to be highly valued in the reproduction of tradition and the rebirthing of boys to men (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312467234">Mavundla, Netswera, Toth, Bottoman, &amp; Tenge, 2010</xref>). The women there said that male circumcision as a medical practice for HIV prevention would breach their customs and be in violation of their cultural practice. Traditional penile cutting and its paraphernalia involves the entire clan, including women, even though it is done to and focused on men and boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312467234">Kelly, Kupul, Fitzgerald, et al., 2012</xref>). This related not just to the initiates but also to the whole community.</p>
<p>As documented elsewhere, the community and clan take precedence over the individual in Papua New Guinea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312467234">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>). Any proposed introduction of male circumcision was viewed as interfering with traditional custom, and would therefore result in the distortion of local practices and meanings ascribed to penile cutting, gender, masculinity, and the spiritual sphere. Moreover, male circumcision as a biomedical technology would disrupt a number of important customary practices above and beyond the actual cutting, including the exchange of wealth, such as the money provided to maternal uncles for touching their nephews’ blood. One mother who was confident in the survival of her tradition explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>Why we like [the traditional practice of cutting] is because how we go to the house and they cut it, it’s different in the village. In the village we do it because we know the reward we usually get. If I do it, at least my brothers have bride price to get. I go to the hospital, they just cut it only. My relatives will not get the payment for the blood for this child of mine. But in the village, yes, they can get it, and majority will say “custom will remain” because they use to get [cash] and [shell money] with regards to such.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other concerns about male circumcision were expressed regarding the importance of feasting at the time of initiation. This would be absent in the clinical setting, even if initiates were returned to the <italic>house boy</italic> (men’s initiation house) for the gaining of cultural knowledge:
<disp-quote>
<p>The government must respect our custom. We must do something pleasing or prepare food before they cut the skin for the children in the house boy. The house boy is a big thing. We built the house boy to cut the skin of the children. We must make food in this house boy before we cut the skin of the children inside. If like they cut their skin only and put them inside the house boy and there is no food, this custom now has been played with [changed].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The preparation of food in this context is of monumental significance. It is not simply a meal but rather a feast in which the whole community is involved—particularly the women—and all parties share in eating the prepared food. Sometimes the preparation takes close to a year, and incorporates crop planting and pig fattening.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1049732312467234">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many participants passionately expressed that they would not allow the government to come into their villages to promote male circumcision, out of fear that it might distort customary rules and facilitate the extinction of their culture. If this were to happen they would seek compensation, because the government would be destroying and changing their customs. For women in the Eastern Highlands Province, where cane swallowing and nose bleeding were customary practices, male circumcision was a radically new concept: “It’s a new kind of practice, and I will say that within this world and everywhere, it’s a new kind of practice.” For others, male circumcision evoked fear: “So when this new message [of circumcision] was given to us we were scared and thinking a lot. . . . Like this [fear] has come about because this was our first time to hear about it.” “It’s not our custom to circumcise and I’m thinking a lot about my children. Like I myself didn’t see this in our village. What is this circumcision? I don’t know and therefore I’m not happy about circumcision.”</p>
<p>Circumcision was not part of many of the women’s communities’ customary practices; therefore they believed that introducing male circumcision for the prevention of HIV, when condoms were already available, was not appropriate:
<disp-quote>
<p>With regard to cutting skin, for myself it’s like if they want to put new idea into the custom, or [the government of] Papua New Guinea, or at the hospital they want to introduce it, I will still go against it. Because I think it’s not good. There are ways; for example, condom is there already to stop like sick [HIV and sexually transmitted infections], and they must still go and use it and they must not use this new type of technique.</p>

<title>Acceptance of Male Circumcision</title>
<p>When asked about the acceptability of male circumcision as an additional HIV prevention measure, only a minority of the women were supportive. These women were mostly from the capital of Papua New Guinea, with the remaining participants equally spread across the other three provinces. The primary reasons the women offered for supporting male circumcision were, in order of priority, prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and improved penile hygiene and health. These reasons for acceptance are consistent with the international literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312467234">Bailey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312467234">Halpern, Metzger, Berlin, &amp; Ubel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312467234">Kebaabetswe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312467234">Mattson, Bailey, Muga, Poulussen, &amp; Onyango, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312467234">Ngalande, Levy, Kapondo, &amp; Bailey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312467234">Nnko, Washija, Urassa, &amp; Boerma, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732312467234">Rain-Taljaard et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section8-1049732312467234">
<title>Prevention of HIV and STIs</title>
<p>The primary reason for the minority of women supporting the introduction of male circumcision was the prevention of HIV, and to a lesser extent other STIs: “I think it’s good to avoid [HIV].” “I go for it because it will reduce the number of HIV.” “I think only the males will benefit more, but like I agree with this circumcision because even though the men wouldn’t become faithful to their wives, the big thing is that [it would] slow down HIV.” Rather than explicitly stating the benefits of circumcision in terms of preventing HIV and other STIs, the women often used generic references to HIV. For example, a young woman mentioned only safety, but not safety from HIV or STIs specifically: “Like we heard it and we felt that it’s good because it will be like safety for the boys to avoid this sik.” Care must be taken to not reinforce this belief, because although male circumcision is probably effective in preventing <italic>human papillomavirus</italic>, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus, it is not effective in preventing transmission of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312467234">
<title>Penile hygiene and health</title>
<p>The second most common reason for the minority of the women to support implementing male circumcision was penile hygiene and health. These women shared the belief that removing the foreskin would help keep the penis clean and healthy, and therefore be preferable to women: “They like it because they don’t want dirty. They don’t want dirty and they want to clean themselves up . . . and also for some days they don’t wash, still clean, and won’t smell.” “If I hear that he had cut the foreskin of his penis, I will simply agree to have sex with him because for the good of his health, he removed the foreskin of the penis; his penis is healthy.”</p>
<p>Men would be prevented from acquiring HIV and thus increase their life expectancy if they had clean and healthy penises as a result of medical circumcision. Women believed that they would benefit from male circumcision because men’s risk to HIV was lowered. A few young women also believed that they would be protected from acquiring cervical cancer: “When all the boys are being circumcised . . . properly, then when they [have sex] with a woman . . . it can also like help the women from getting cervical cancer.”</p>
<p>The importance of reproduction and motherhood in the lives of women has been shown in part to be associated with an orientation toward the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312467234">Barnes &amp; Murphy, 2009</xref>). In Uganda, HIV-positive women with HIV-negative, uncircumcised husbands had high levels of support for male circumcision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312467234">Mugwanya et al., 2010</xref>). One woman living with HIV reflected on the importance of human reproduction and its associated functions within family and culture in Papua New Guinea. She described the role that such a biomedical technology could play for her in having a family. She lived in a serodiscordant relationship in which her husband was HIV negative, and she hoped that male circumcision could assist her in conception while reducing the risk of his seroconversion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this was the first qualitative study of women’s acceptability of male circumcision for HIV prevention in Papua New Guinea, and one of the first such studies in a moderate-prevalence setting outside Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312467234">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312467234">Madhivanan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312467234">Madhivanan, Krupp, Kulkarni, Kulkarni, &amp; Klausner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732312467234">Ruan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1049732312467234">Tieu et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, it appears that in comparison with the international literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312467234">Madhivanan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1049732312467234">Westercamp &amp; Bailey, 2007</xref>), the women in this study were far less accepting of male circumcision than women in other developing countries. This suggests that women in Papua New Guinea did not uncritically or unreflectively accept technological innovation, or what Winner called “technological somnambulism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1049732312467234">1978</xref>).</p>
<p>The women’s beliefs about the acceptability of male circumcision were based on a complex relationship between cultural norms, expectations, attitudes, and knowledge gained from a variety of sources, including but not limited to traditional and Christian values and beliefs. Therefore, the women were able to describe what they saw as the “practical and everyday implications of biomedicine” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312467234">Lock &amp; Nguyen, 2010</xref>, p. 22) in their lives. Our data indicate that not only did the vast majority of women object to male circumcision, but they viewed it as ultimately negligent in the protection of women and girls, marriage, custom, and the future of their country. Much can be learned from the reasons provided by the women regarding their objection to the future development of biomedical technologies.</p>
<p>Sexual risk compensation was the key concern among the women in this study. Although intended to provide additional protection from HIV acquisition in men, male circumcision has never been promoted in Papua New Guinea as a replacement for other proven protective measures such as condom use and partner reduction. Even though much of the evidence suggests that there is no sexual risk compensation post male circumcision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312467234">Agot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312467234">Auvert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312467234">Bailey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312467234">Bailey, Neema, &amp; Othieno, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312467234">Cassell, Halperin, Shelton, &amp; Stanton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312467234">Gray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312467234">Kebaabetswe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312467234">Lagarde, Dirk, Puren, Reathe, &amp; Bertran, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312467234">Mattson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732312467234">Rain-Taljaard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732312467234">Riess et al., 2010</xref>), in a gender-sensitive and locally specific approach to HIV prevention, this evidence should not be used as a yardstick by which to predict men’s sexual behavior in Papua New Guinea. To do so would be to dismiss the real or imagined concerns of women in this study. To assume that men’s sexual behavior in Papua New Guinea post male circumcision would be entirely congruent with the experience in other settings would fail to take account of local social realities and cultural contexts in which male circumcision is being assessed as a biomedical technology.</p>
<p>Some women’s discussion of risk compensation in relation to physical and sexual violence was of particular concern, specifically the fear that men would take on other partners and rape women and girls because they no longer feared infection, and the potential role of male circumcision in exacerbating sexual antagonism. Violence, including sexual violence against women, is not peculiar to Papua New Guinea, but it is commonplace, as is violence between wives and girlfriends. It would be remiss to implement any HIV prevention program for men at the expense of increasing women’s vulnerability to gender-based violence, HIV, and other STIs. As Weiss et al. stated, any “expansion of male circumcision services needs to include rigorous monitoring and evaluation to ensure that there are no adverse consequences for female partners of circumcised men” (2009, p. 676). If male circumcision was to be introduced in Papua New Guinea despite women’s objections, evidence shows that such serious adverse consequences are likely to increase, and indeed place women at greater risk of infection.</p>
<p>Both religion and culture played important roles in the notional acceptability of male circumcision among women in a number of international studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312467234">Lagarde et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312467234">Nnko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732312467234">Rain-Taljaard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1049732312467234">Westercamp &amp; Bailey, 2007</xref>). Women in our study were extremely concerned about the integrity of local cultures, and believed that male circumcision programs would interfere in or potentially destroy customary practices. This was the case for women from both customary and noncustomary penile-cutting cultures. Similarly, cultural objection has been identified in a number of studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312467234">Bailey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312467234">Kebaabetswe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312467234">Nnko et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Culture was deep-seated within the women’s concerns regarding sexual risk compensation, as evidenced by indigenous concerns of contagion. In Papua New Guinean cultural logic, bodily fluids are highly symbolic in both positive and negative ways, possessing the power to either create or destroy. When a bodily fluid is not contained in its culturally prescribed place, contagion or pollution occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049732312467234">Stewart &amp; Strathern, 2002</xref>). In this way, dirt is “matter out of place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312467234">Douglas, 1966/1984</xref>), and therefore powerful bodily substances require management (Stewart &amp; Strathern). Among the women’s concerns regarding risk compensation, the introduction of male circumcision would disturb the prescribed management of contagion from HIV through the use condoms and refraining from having sex with other women, particularly <italic>pamuk meris</italic>, and raping women and girls. Notably, placement of matter is not just a structural concept, but about the enactment of moral agency (Stewart &amp; Strathern). Here, the intersection between the logic of cultural contagion and Christian sexual ideology entwined.</p>
<p>Women in this study were concerned with HIV prevention methods that could potentially promote promiscuity. Condoms have long been viewed in Papua New Guinea as promoting promiscuous, un-Christian behavior among both men and women, whereby sex becomes a “game,” and the individuals involved would be devoid of either personal or social responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312467234">Kelly, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312467234">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1049732312467234">Wilde, 2007</xref>). In this ideology, Christianity, or a Christian life, becomes a means of preventing HIV. But it is not only Christian teachings that reinforce this sexual ideology. Research shows that similar views were in existence before missionaries arrived in Papua New Guinea, and were thus part of traditional custom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312467234">Herdt, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>According to women in this study, prevention measures that promote promiscuity extend to male circumcision. The formula for prevention that women in the study put forward reinforced and extended the tension that persists between clinical research evidence and cultural and religious beliefs. These objections reinforce the need to critically and meaningfully engage with local milieus in the design, implementation, and evaluation of HIV prevention strategies, particularly gendered biomedical prevention technologies such as male circumcision and vaginal microbicides.</p>
<p>The ultimate success of a biomedical intervention such as male circumcision is dependent on the behavior of individuals and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312467234">de Wit, Aggleton, Myers, &amp; Crewe, 2011</xref>), as well as acceptability by both individuals and communities. Findings from this study suggest that should male circumcision be implemented in Papua New Guinea, it should be done with great caution, and that wide-scale roll-out be informed by carefully designed pilot intervention programs capable of monitoring and evaluating sexual risk compensation from both women’s and men’s perspectives. Should policymakers in Papua New Guinea decide against population-based male circumcision programs, targeted interventions might be more appropriate and feasible, and might provide significant benefits in some key populations of men at increased risk of HIV acquisition, such as men in serodiscordant relationships. In Papua New Guinea, such relationships have received limited research, policy, and programming attention to date, yet couples in such situations are recognized to be at substantial risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312467234">Kelly et al., 2011</xref>). Additional work on the acceptability of male circumcision among such populations is warranted to inform future policy in Papua New Guinea, and might be relevant to other countries experiencing moderate-prevalence HIV epidemics.</p>
<p>The prevention of future infections remains a key public health priority in Papua New Guinea. Although male circumcision has been put on hold in the current National HIV and AIDS Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312467234">Papua New Guinea National AIDS Council, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312467234">2010b</xref>), it has recently been debated by researchers, policymakers, and development partners in male circumcision at a national policy forum. The primary recommendation was to develop a comprehensive harm-reduction program to prevent risk associated with harm as a result of current penile-cutting practices; it was also recommended that the widespread roll-out of male circumcision be delayed. For any future policy discussions on the role that male circumcision would play in Papua New Guinea’s response to HIV, the voices of women must be central so they are not further disempowered in a dominant masculine culture. Neither should a culture of prevention and evidence that emphasizes the biomedical at the expense of sociocultural and behavioral understandings of the epidemic be reinforced.</p>

<p>We are aware that even prior to the most recent downsizing of Papua New Guinea’s epidemic, it does not fit clearly into the WHO and UNAIDS guidelines for a high-prevalence setting. That said, in some parts of Papua New Guinea, medical male circumcision had already begun, and discussions were beginning to surface regarding a national policy on this topic. Furthermore, there was no suggestion that at that time the epidemic would be downsized. Irrespective of the recent estimate, the findings of this study are important in the development of any future policies on HIV prevention in Papua New Guinea.</p>
