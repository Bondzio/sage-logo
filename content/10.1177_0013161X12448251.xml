<p><bold>Background:</bold> In Ohio, levy campaigns are a burdensome task for district administrators and stakeholders alike. To date, there is little research on the districts’ role in crafting school budget referenda campaigns. <bold>Purpose:</bold> This study asked three research questions: How did the macropolitical contexts shape stakeholders’ decision making in terms of campaign strategizing and participation? How did the micropolitical contexts shape stakeholder decision making in terms of campaign strategizing and participation? How did successful districts differ in political strategies from districts that were not successful? <bold>Research Design:</bold> Qualitative case studies. <bold>Data Collection:</bold> Twenty-three informants from five Ohio school districts with levies on the November 2008 ballot. Using a snowball sampling technique, initial informants (i.e., superintendent, treasurer) were asked to identify additional stakeholders who participated in the campaigns. <bold>Data Analysis:</bold> Coding was initially guided by multiple theoretical frameworks, including macro/micropolitics, Johnson’s 21 campaign strategies and Anderson’s framework of “authentic” participation. After coding, an iterative team memo-writing process was used. <bold>Findings:</bold> This study offers important insight into the complexities of the environments and strategies used in levy campaigns. Four macropolitical themes were identified—state campaign policies, state education finance policy, the high-profile nature of the Presidential election, and the state of the economy. Despite a small sample, districts varied greatly in strategies used and community involvement. Districts that heavily engaged community members and created a sense of urgency yielded greater success at the polls than “central office campaigns.” Adequate message training for campaign participants was also integral to success.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>November 4, 2008 will be remembered in history as the day that the United States elected the first African American President. Some will look back on that day as one of joy and optimism for the hope and change on which candidate Obama campaigned. Hope and change meant many things—a postracial society, health care reform, an end (or at least a reduction) of hostilities in Iraq and Afghanistan, and an end to the deep recession. Others will remember the day more tentatively, as one of an uncertain future. Still others will remember the day as one of great disappointment at the loss of the McCain–Palin ticket. Although it is too early to know what the legacy of the Obama administration will be, the day is undoubtedly a first in the nation’s history.</p>
<p>What is less memorable is that on that same historic day, voters all across Ohio—a state identified as a key “battleground” state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013161X12448251">Caswell, 2009</xref>)—cast votes on a total of 236 levies statewide, seeking additional or status quo funding for schools. President Obama’s background as a community organizer on Chicago’s Southside—a background that undoubtedly contributed to his successful presidential bid—is well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013161X12448251">Allen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013161X12448251">Guinier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013161X12448251">Mack &amp; Chen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0013161X12448251">Moberg, 2007</xref>). Like Obama in Chicago and his presidential campaign workers, community organizers in these districts planned and implemented campaign strategies in pursuit of voter approval with varying levels of engagement and success toward their goal—at least 51% of constituents voting yes.</p>
<p>The troubles and litigation surrounding Ohio’s school finance program are well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013161X12448251">Alexander &amp; Alexander, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013161X12448251">Johnson &amp; Ingle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013161X12448251">Hunter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0013161X12448251">Maxwell &amp; Sweetland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013161X12448251">McKinley &amp; Phillis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0013161X12448251">Murphy, 1983</xref>). As with many U.S. states, Ohio funds public education through a combination of local property taxes and state aid. What makes Ohio unique is the frequency in which voters are asked to decide school budget referenda. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013161X12448251">Fleeter (2007)</xref> states that “Ohio relies on voter approval of tax levies to support public education to a greater extent than any other state in the nation” (p. 1). The omnipresent school levy on Ohio ballots is the result of a 1976 constitutional amendment, originally known as House Bill 920, that prohibits property taxes from increasing as property values rise; thus districts are forced to continually return to the ballot just to keep up with inflationary costs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0013161X12448251">Maxwell and Sweetland (2008)</xref> have noted,<disp-quote>
<p>Ohio’s schools are sometimes faced with the dilemma of explaining that the schools are receiving no additional funds from voted in taxes. Under an accountability model, this leaves school officials with an ‘uphill’ task in convincing voters that additional revenues are necessary. (§4.10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the state of Ohio, school funding is complicated by property tax policies that neutralize automatic increases in local revenue (i.e., real estate property reduction factor, tax abatement, and the reduction of the personal tangible property tax assessment rates). When real estate property values increase due to reappraisal or the triennial update cycle, tax rates are reduced such that the districts continue to collect the same amount of revenue from voted levies applied to the same property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0013161X12448251">Maxwell &amp; Sweetland, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In Ohio, levy campaigns are an ongoing burdensome task, depleting energy and resources that could (potentially) be better spent toward improving academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013161X12448251">Ingle, Petroff, &amp; Johnson, 2011</xref>). As a point of reference, operating levies in Ohio typically range from 2 to 10 mills. From February 1994 to November 2006, Ohio voters only approved 40.4% of all new property and income tax levies while renewal and replacement levies were approved by voters at a rate of 83.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013161X12448251">Fleeter, 2007</xref>). In the November 2008 campaign period, the passage rate was lower for new operating levies, with only 22.2% of them being approved by voters. As will be shown, Ohio law limits the role that districts and their personnel can play in campaigns. As a result, each district finances their campaigns through private donations. School and district personnel can play active roles in the campaigns, but must limit their activities to before and after school hours. Otherwise, they risk being accused of violating state law. District administrators, school boards, and other key stakeholders in Ohio communities must weigh their options and pursue courses of action to ensure adequate, or at the least, status quo funding. In doing so, many decisions must be made. First, these stakeholders must select from an array of levy options. In November 2008, Ohio districts put forth 42 variations and combinations of levies on the ballot. With four possible times in which levies can be placed on the ballot (February, May, August, November), key stakeholders must also decide when to place the levy (or levies) on the ballot. Once these decisions are made, the campaign strategizing to face the political conditions within the district begins.</p>
<p>Part of a larger project that sought to estimate the costs of five new operating levies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013161X12448251">Ingle, Petroff, &amp; Johnson, 2011</xref>), this study examined the macro/micropolitical environments, the campaign strategies used in their efforts to gain voter approval, and the stakeholders involved in campaigning. Using interviews with 23 key stakeholders (e.g., superintendent, treasurer, campaign committee chair, volunteers) across five districts, this study sought answers to the following questions:</p>

<list-item><p>How did successful districts differ in political strategies from districts that were not successful?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although not generalizable beyond the five sampled districts in the time period leading up to the November 2008 election, our study offers important insight into the complexities of their macro/micropolitical environments and the strategies used to win support for school levies. Indeed, it has been noted that the purpose of a case study is “not to represent the world, but to represent the case” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0013161X12448251">Stake, 2005</xref>, p. 460).</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>We now will discuss the relevant research literature to frame our study of the macropolitical, micropolitical, and strategic contexts of five Ohio school districts. First, we examine the extant literature on factors associated with referenda outcomes, summarizing primary variables of interest and their relationships. We then briefly discuss the research on community engagement and the strategies schools, districts, and stakeholders undertake in its pursuit. Finally, we briefly summarize the research using a micro- and macropolitical lens to examine school and district environments.</p>
<p>Research on school budget referenda has examined the relationship between various factors and referenda outcomes, such as subpopulations’ voting behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013161X12448251">Bali, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013161X12448251">Ehrenberg, Ehrenberg, Smith, &amp; Zhang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013161X12448251">Gradstein &amp; Kaganovich, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013161X12448251">Ladd &amp; Murray, 2001</xref>). Notably, research has focused on the percentage of elderly voters within districts and its impact on school budget referenda. These studies have produced mixed results, having some studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013161X12448251">Ladd &amp; Murray, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0013161X12448251">Poterba, 1997</xref>) suggesting that an increase in the percentage of elderly voters was not associated with a decrease in educational spending per student except when the elderly and school-age populations came from different racial groups. Others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013161X12448251">Gradstein &amp; Kaganovich, 2004</xref>) indicate that retirees prefer a decrease in the amount of spending on education, rationalizing that they will not live to see the benefits or that they have long borne the tax burden across their many years.</p>
<p>Research has also examined the relationship of district characteristics (e.g., Authors, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013161X12448251">Berkman &amp; Plutzer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013161X12448251">Bowers &amp; Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013161X12448251">Bowers, Metzger, &amp; Militello, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013161X12448251">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013161X12448251">Lentz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0013161X12448251">Sanders &amp; Lee, 2009</xref>) to school budget referenda outcomes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013161X12448251">Lentz (1999)</xref> examined referenda from Illinois school districts in the period 1981-1989. Using a school district jurisdictional typology consisting of six categories of school districts based on land use, Lentz found that homogeneous districts (small rural and residential suburbs) had significantly higher passage rates than heterogeneous districts. For all jurisdictional types, land use homogeneity, prior willingness to pay higher taxes for schools and capacity to pay were the most important predictors of referenda outcomes. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013161X12448251">Bowers et al. (2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013161X12448251">2010b)</xref> found that rural districts were at a greater disadvantage in passing bond elections than urban/suburban districts. School districts in small municipalities fared worst of all. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013161X12448251">Bowers et al. (2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013161X12448251">2010b)</xref> found rural and small municipality school districts less likely to pass school construction bonds in Michigan. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013161X12448251">Bowers and Lee (2011)</xref> did not produce comparable results in their Texas school construction bonds study and suggest that district locale and its impact on outcomes may be state/context specific.</p>
<p>In another recent study examining voting results for school district budgets in the state of New York from 2003 to 2010, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0013161X12448251">Silverman (2011)</xref> reported that larger districts were more likely to vote for local property tax increases, but districts with larger minority populations, larger overall growth in school budgets, and higher voter turnout were associated with a decrease in the likelihood of passage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0013161X12448251">Shober (2011)</xref> sought to answer whether school choice options (i.e., charter schools and magnet schools) increase the likelihood of school budget referenda success. He found that the number of charter schools was associated with an increase in the likelihood of passage, while the number of magnet schools was not. The percentages of college-educated residents and senior citizens were also significantly related to an increased likelihood of school referenda passage.</p>
<p>Research has also examined other factors, such as the amounts/millage requested, experience levels of school board members, and the number of times a referendum is attempted in relation to outcomes (Authors, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013161X12448251">Balsdon, Brunner, &amp; Rueben, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013161X12448251">Bowers et al. 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013161X12448251">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013161X12448251">Bowers &amp; Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013161X12448251">Ehrenberg et al., 2004</xref>). Nonstrategic district characteristics are conditions and contexts in which school budget referenda advocates (and opponents) must operate. These factors can be significant, but it comes down to voter behaviors behind the curtain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013161X12448251">Bali (2008)</xref> notes that individuals’ decision making at the polls is motivated by ideological predispositions, self-interest, and racially based incentives. However, referenda advocates can pursue strategies that can increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. This leads us to our discussion of the importance of community engagement and strategies for increasing such involvement.</p>
<p>The community engagement research has examined why parents become involved in education, focusing largely on the relationships that develop between parents and teachers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013161X12448251">Hoover-Dempsey &amp; Sandler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0013161X12448251">Miretzky, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013161X12448251">Apple and Beane (1995)</xref> have argued that local decision making is held up as an ideal, but it remains largely in the realm of rhetoric. The highly hierarchical, bureaucratic structure of schools and educators’ self-perceptions of professionalism leads to resistance and devaluation of what is deemed as “unprofessional” parent/community input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013161X12448251">Cibulka, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0013161X12448251">Mediratta &amp; Fruchter, 2003</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013161X12448251">Furman and Starratt (2002)</xref> cite fear of a lack of control as to why the application of democracy in schools is minimal at best with parents, who are often relegated to visitor and support-at-home roles. When school councils were able to have an impact on classroom practices and decision making, competent parent chairpersons, supportive principals, and a past history of positive parent–teacher relationships were positive (albeit) weak predictors. Evidence suggests that stakeholder participation in educational reform efforts seldom goes beyond rhetoric or superficiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12448251">Anderson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013161X12448251">Beare, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013161X12448251">Hargreaves, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013161X12448251">Malen &amp; Ogawa, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0013161X12448251">Schutz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0013161X12448251">Smyth, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0013161X12448251">Spillane &amp; Thompson, 1997</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0013161X12448251">Schutz (2006)</xref> recently noted, “schools and school districts erect barriers with one hand while reaching out with another” (p. 726).</p>
<p>Researchers have identified strategies for increasing community engagement, largely focusing on urban settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013161X12448251">Glickman &amp; Scally, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013161X12448251">Gold, Simon, Mundell, &amp; Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0013161X12448251">Schutz, 2006</xref>) and among schools serving large percentages of minority populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013161X12448251">Arriaza, 2004</xref>). The development of social capital, community leadership, and input builds community capacity and can increase public accountability for improving schools in ways that benefit those who have most often been disadvantaged. The alternative is the unfortunate development of antagonistic relationships between communities and schools in which each side plays the blame game for problems within the school and/or district (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013161X12448251">Glickman &amp; Scally, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013161X12448251">Gold, Simon, &amp; Brown, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>As to strategies affecting voters’ support for education issues, the literature identifies factors, such as understanding what voters will support, presenting a focused referendum, presenting a unified front from multiple stakeholders, targeting “yes” voters, communicating important information, and developing good relationships with the local media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013161X12448251">Johnson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013161X12448251">Boschee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013161X12448251">Carter &amp; Devries, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013161X12448251">Conrad, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013161X12448251">Davis &amp; Tyson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013161X12448251">Holt, 1984</xref>). However, these are prescriptive articles and case studies that suggest best practices and “what worked for us” in specific district contexts. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013161X12448251">Carter and Devries (1967)</xref> espoused “ten commandments” for successful levy campaigns: know where you stand before attempting to convince the public, enlist the aid of citizens to champion your cause, stay in the background and function as a research source, ignore the opposition, build the campaign around an emotional appeal, use inexpensive brochures, do not threaten the public, do not count on newspaper support, concentrate on the “yes” voters, do not forget the public after the issue passes, and continue an aggressive public campaign.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013161X12448251">Johnson (2008)</xref> examined 21 school levy strategies identified through a literature review associated with successful school levy campaigns in the context of a single Ohio case study district. However, most of the research consisted of unpublished dissertations and professional/trade journals. While the study confirmed the importance of these strategies, it also presented evidence of a two-step approach to planning levy campaigns that might help districts pass levies. This included a first campaign that successfully used the traditional strategy of a high profile, high voter turnout campaign and a second low-profile campaign designed to specifically target “Yes” voters and rally them to the polls. Both steps in the end were essential to the campaign’s final victory. The first campaign may best be described as a “shotgun approach” whereas the second campaign is akin to a “rifle shot with a silencer,” in that it is much more specific in who is targeted and seeks to target yes voters quietly in order not to provoke no voters. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0013161X12448251">Silverman (2011)</xref> suggested that school districts should adopt participatory budget tools and involve community stakeholders in decision making in order to promote sustainable educational resources.</p>
<p>Community engagement experts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12448251">Anderson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013161X12448251">Arriaza, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013161X12448251">Comer, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013161X12448251">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013161X12448251">Epstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0013161X12448251">Schutz, 2006</xref>) have suggested that community members can be the greatest adversaries or allies to a district’s efforts. For the community to be the latter, school leaders must be open to community engagement and toward that end, gain an extensive knowledge of the communities in which they serve and provide meaningful ways in which stakeholders can be involved in the education of their youth. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12448251">Anderson (1998)</xref> developed a framework that examines the micro- and macropolitical considerations influencing what he terms <italic>authentic participation</italic>. Anderson found that “authentic participation” is atypical. Limited and/or “inauthentic” forms of participation are dominant in schools—the consequences of which are the reinforcement of exclusionary power perceptions in school systems. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12448251">Anderson (1998)</xref> contends that discourse alone<disp-quote>
<p>has been used to promote a variety of—often contradictory—social policies and has been used as a cover term for institutional arrangements and management techniques that, while purporting to advance democracy and change, too often tend to support an inequitable status quo, (p. 587)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>thus resulting in a decreased likelihood of true community-school engagement.</p>
<p>Research examining the micropolitics within schools suggests that the behaviors of stakeholders—including strategies and tactics—are strongly influenced by their varied interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013161X12448251">Ball, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013161X12448251">Blase, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013161X12448251">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013161X12448251">Hoyle, 1982</xref>). Although these disparate interests may foment struggles for power, influence, and control, they may also lend themselves to collaboration, negotiation, and coalition building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013161X12448251">Blase, 1991</xref>). In the case of school budget referenda, the behaviors and participation of stakeholders can range widely. Behaviors and participation may be limited to ballot casting at the polls or heavily engaged as an active campaign volunteer. For participation to be the latter, the potential volunteer to some degree must be motivated and encouraged to participate. In one recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013161X12448251">Johnson &amp; Ingle, 2009</xref>), it was reported that only 66% of superintendent respondents indicated community stakeholders were involved in their districts’ levy campaigns. For districts that involved community members, the level of participation varied from extremely active “grassroots” volunteerism to community committees in which members served as ceremonial or figurehead roles only.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013161X12448251">Iannaccone (1975)</xref> described the focus of micropolitics of schools as “the interaction and political ideologies of social systems of teachers, administrators, and pupils within school buildings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013161X12448251">Iannaccone, 1975</xref> p. 43). The conceptual boundaries and distinctive features of micropolitics remain elusive and contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013161X12448251">Bjork &amp; Lindle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013161X12448251">Mawhinney, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013161X12448251">Malen &amp; Cochran, 2008</xref>). There is debate as to whether district-level politics are in the macro- or micropolitical realm. However, macro- and micropolitics are grounded in similar concepts, such as power, formal/informal arenas, influence, control, conflict/cooperation, strategies, exchange, negotiation, interest groups, values, and ideologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013161X12448251">Ball, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013161X12448251">Blase &amp; Blase, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013161X12448251">Marshall &amp; Scribner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0013161X12448251">Wirt &amp; Kirst, 2005</xref>). The extant research on district-level politics has been described as drawing “the intermittent attention of political scholars” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013161X12448251">Bjork &amp; Lindle, 2001</xref>, p. 77). While there has been interest in the districts’ role in implementing state/federal policies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013161X12448251">Iatarola &amp; Fruchte, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0013161X12448251">Rorrer, Skrla, &amp; Scheurich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0013161X12448251">Rutledge &amp; Park, 2009</xref>), there is little research on the district’s role in school budget referenda campaigns, who and how district leaders involve community stakeholders and how macro- and micropolitical conditions shape campaign strategies and participation.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>

<title>Site Selection</title>
<p>Our study examined five districts pursuing new operating levy campaigns that were on the November 2008 ballot in the state of Ohio (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013161X12448251">Table 1</xref>). New operating levies were chosen, as research suggests that these levies have the highest failure rates among voters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013161X12448251">Johnson &amp; Ingle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013161X12448251">Fleeter, 2007</xref>). Indeed, November 2008 campaign results saw only 22 of 99 new operating levies approved by voters in their districts. Selected were two rural districts (one passed its levy, one failed), two suburban districts (one passed, one failed), and one urban district (passed). The paired districts were purposively selected due to their similarities, including student populations served, district typology, and performance under Ohio’s school accountability system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013161X12448251">1</xref></sup> With regard to the single urban school district, Ohio has 15 districts that are classified by the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) as “Major Urban School Districts with Very High Poverty.” Because of there being only one urban district with a failed new operating levy—and an inability to protect the identity of the district—only one urban district (passing its levy) was selected.</p>

<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>District-level administrators, school-level administrators, teachers, and parent volunteers in the selected Ohio school districts were interviewed for the project. In total, 23 informants from the 5 sampled districts were interviewed. Preliminary informants were purposively selected based on their leadership roles within the district and/or campaign (i.e., district superintendent, school treasurer). Using a snowball sampling technique, initial informants were asked to identify additional stakeholders who participated in the campaigns and would serve as useful informants (e.g., community campaign chair, parent-, teacher-, and community volunteers). The semistructured interviews were approximately 1 to 2 hours in length and consisted of questions related to their role in the levy campaign, the costs associated with the campaign, and the extent to which the community was engaged (and how). Informants were asked to discuss levy campaign activities in terms of three stages: campaign planning, campaign implementation, and campaign debriefing. We define debriefing activities as those that involve analyzing the results and factors that contributed to the success or defeat of the levy campaign being studied. The interviews were completed between December 2008 and May 2009—within 6 months of the November 2008 election day. This was done to mitigate any loss of details due to the passage of time. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Transcripts were coded using NVivo7 and an iterative team memo-writing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0013161X12448251">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Our coding of the transcripts was both deductively and inductively driven. With regards to the former, we were guided by multiple theoretical frameworks, including shared concepts within macro- and micropolitics, such as power, formal/informal arenas, influence, control, conflict/cooperation, strategies, exchange, negotiation, interest groups, values, and ideologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013161X12448251">Ball, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013161X12448251">Blase &amp; Blase, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013161X12448251">Marshall &amp; Scribner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0013161X12448251">Wirt &amp; Kirst, 2005</xref>). As stated previously, the conceptual boundaries and distinctive features of micropolitics remain elusive and contested, particularly as to whether district-level politics are in the macro- or micropolitical realm. Within the context of this study, the micropolitical environment refers to the politics that takes place within the sampled districts, their schools, and the communities they serve. The macropolitical environment refers to the politics that takes place at the state (Ohio) and federal levels. We also used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013161X12448251">Johnson’s (2008)</xref> 21 political strategies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013161X12448251">2</xref></sup> employed in levy campaigns to categorize levy campaign strategies. Last, we drew on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12448251">Anderson’s (1998)</xref> framework of “authentic” and “inauthentic” participation to inform our analysis of stakeholder involvement in the levy campaigns. In addition to these frameworks, we also developed codes drawing from our own iterative and inductive process.</p>
<p>After the data were coded, we used an iterative team memo-writing process in our analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0013161X12448251">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Memo writing is an analytical tool that allows qualitative researchers to abstract meaning from data through a process in which the researcher becomes immersed in the data and reflectively writes on emerging codes and themes, one’s own subjective experience, and the interplay of subjective influences on the collection and interpretation of data. It has been noted that memo writing is not restricted to the analytical phase of research. Memo writing also aids in the mapping of preliminary research activities (e.g., data collection) and facilitates communication among members of the research team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013161X12448251">Birks, Chapman, &amp; Francis, 2008</xref>). For this study, individual members of the research team independently analyzed the coded data and wrote memos in which we analyzed findings on individual school districts and research questions. As a group, we then met face-to-face to discuss the content of the memos. We discussed their content, the extent to which similar themes emerged, and determined whether further analysis was needed. Memos were written until we had achieved theoretical and empirical saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013161X12448251">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Macropolitics</title>
<p>We first turn our attention to the macropolitical conditions at the state and federal levels in which the informants reported as shaping the campaigns and participation. Our analysis suggests four major macropolitical themes—state campaign policies, state education finance policy, the high profile nature of the November 2008 ballot, and last, the economy of Ohio and the nation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013161X12448251">Table 2</xref>). With regard to the first of these, all school district employees interviewed for this study regardless of district were always quick to point out that their campaign activities were before or after the school day had ended. Per §9.03 of the Ohio Revised Code, political subdivisions can expend public funds to communicate information, but not to support or oppose the passage of a levy or bond issue. When asked directly how much time on the campaign was during school hours, the superintendent from District C replied, “I don’t want people to think this is happening during our normal business hours. The hours for levy went above beyond what it took to do our jobs.”</p>

<p>Shaded districts won their levy campaigns.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>With regard to state education finance policy, informants—specifically superintendents, treasurers, and school board members—discussed the nature of education finance in the state of Ohio. District-level leaders consistently discussed the uncertainty—not only of the economy, but also the future of education funding in Ohio. In 2006, Ted Strickland was elected Ohio’s 68th governor with the campaign promise of fixing the school-funding system in Ohio.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0013161X12448251">3</xref></sup> By 2008, Governor Strickland was traversing the state, conducting a series of town hall meetings seeking input from constituents on how to do just that. One of the themes that emerged from these meetings was the overreliance on local property taxes for the support of local schools. The message emerging from the Governor’s meetings and speeches was that the solution was to reduce the reliance on local property taxes by increasing the state’s share of the school-funding formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0013161X12448251">Office of the Governor, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0013161X12448251">n.d.</xref>). This solution garnered the broad-based support of both taxpayers and educators. However, one of the unintended consequences was that it sent the message to local taxpayers that support of local tax levies may not be necessary since the state was perceived as taking care of the problem. One informant from District D simply referred to the Governor’s discussions as a “curveball that he threw.”</p>
<p>The superintendents, treasurers, and school board members interviewed as part of this study not only discussed the complexities of Ohio’s school-funding mechanism but also consistently discussed the inevitability of returning to the ballot that results from the state’s system. When asked if the passage of the November 2008 levy would result in being on the ballot less often, none suggested that they held much hope in being on the ballot less in the foreseeable future. District E’s Superintendent stated, “We are on the ballot a lot . . . There have been five campaigns in seven years and we have passed three of them.”</p>
<p>November elections have tended to be a popular time to place levies on the ballot. There are two reasons for this higher propensity—costs and timing. “Charge back” costs—board of elections fees charged to districts for placing a levy on the ballot—are less in November because there are more referenda on the ballots when there are national elections, especially in presidential elections. In addition, Ohio state law caps how much the county board of elections can charge during a presidential general election. As such, the costs of placing a levy on the ballot in November are typically lower than other times in the year. Furthermore, voter turnout is higher in U. S. presidential elections than in midterm elections where state races for governor top the ballot (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013161X12448251">Jennings &amp; Zeigler, 1970</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0013161X12448251">McAtee &amp; Wolak, 2011</xref>). There is evidence that suggests greater intensity in battleground states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013161X12448251">Hill &amp; McKee, 2005</xref>), and Ohio has been identified as such a state (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013161X12448251">Caswell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013161X12448251">Cheng &amp; Riffe, 2008</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013161X12448251">Fleeter (2007)</xref>, Ohio levies have historically had higher passage rates when placed on the May primary or November general election ballots in comparison with February and August Special Elections. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013161X12448251">Fleeter (2007)</xref> suggests that this is “a consequence of lower voter turnout in the special elections” (p. 17). While conventional wisdom suggests that Democrats (and education issues) benefit from high voter turnout, the political science research actually indicates mixed results (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013161X12448251">DeNardo, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013161X12448251">Holbrook &amp; McClurg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0013161X12448251">Nagel &amp; McNulty, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0013161X12448251">Osborn, McClurg, &amp; Knoll, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0013161X12448251">Radcliff, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Informants in the three districts that passed their levies reported that the high-profile presidential election of November 2008 likely worked to their advantage. An informant from District A (a Republican leaning district) noted the importance of the 2008 Presidential campaign featuring Obama and McCain, noting that the higher democratic turnout was “one of those quirks in the district that helped to get this thing passed—those that were on the fringe, the students, and the folks that don’t vote all the time. I do think it helped with the vote.”</p>
<p>An informant from District B (whose levy was defeated at the polls) stated, “We hoped and planned on higher turnout helping to win. Such was not the case.” When asked about the timing of her district’s levy, an informant from District C simply stated, “We wanted to do this then because of the presidential election.” The Superintendent from District E stated:<disp-quote>
<p>We talked about the timing of our campaign in November ‘07. Should we go out in March ‘08? I proposed going out in November of ‘08 at that time. I did not know who the candidates were going to be on either side . . . but I thought the presidential election gave us our best shot.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The community campaign chairman from District E stated,<disp-quote>
<p>We actually connected to the back of the Obama headquarters here in . . . They did not use the whole place, so we put our levy headquarters there. So we had literature drops done from there. That is where people picked up the literature. We had a few meetings there and things of that nature.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Only informants from District D reported that the timing would be detrimental to their likelihood of winning. The Superintendent from District D stated:<disp-quote>
<p>When we got to the new money which was in November, I knew we would get killed because you have a big presidential election. You are going to have the large turnout. You have biblical proportions of turnout, but we still had to do it. We had to be out there.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The superintendent of this rural, predominantly white school district presumed that voters would not only come out in droves for the McCain–Palin ticket, but that this energized constituency would also vote down new taxes—which they did. The Superintendent would go on to voice his frustration, stating that, “The farmers felt like ‘you are hurting us because you are going for property.’ I don’t think they understand income tax hurts you too. I don’t have time to educate them.” Informants across the districts consistently voiced that voters were concerned about their federal, state, and local tax burdens.</p>
<p>The dire state of the economy in Ohio (and the nation as a whole) exacerbated public concern over additional tax levies in all the sampled districts. Consistent across all informants was the impact of the recession, foreclosures, and job losses, which weighed heavily in the minds of stakeholders, but district finances warranted pursuing the levies. In District B, informants suggested that the amount requested was too much in the face of the recession, paired with unclear consequences and a lack of urgency. An informant from District E commented on the outcome of the levy and the economic conditions at the time, stating,<disp-quote>
<p>We were proud of ourselves! Regardless of how [levy passage] happened, it happened. No one thought it would in this district. This district is a poverty-based district. There is a lot of unemployment; a lot of foreclosures here. We were very blessed that the win happened. But it did not happen by accident entirely. We ran an effective campaign so we believe we did put forth the effort and effort that was good.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Our informants across the case study districts were surprisingly consistent in their identification of the four macropolitical conditions that had an impact on campaign planning and implementation. Informants (employees of the districts) acknowledged the state laws governing the fine line that they must walk in pursuing and advocating for their district’s levy. Informants resignedly discussed the in and outs of school funding in Ohio and the inevitability of another levy campaign at some point in their future—that it is not if, but when they are on the ballot the next time. Informants from four of the five districts strategically selected the November 2008 election period in the hopes that high-profile election would increase their likelihood of passage. Informants from District D took their chances in November 2008, but were cynical about their chances of victory. No informants from any of the districts saw the state and local economies—important political issues of the time—as aiding their efforts. Informants also discussed the strategizing that went into these campaigns, but as will be shown, community involvement and strategies varied from district to district based on micropolitical conditions—real and perceived.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0013161X12448251">
<title>Micropolitics</title>
<p>As these informants have indicated, there were inherent macropolitical challenges that had to be faced. For that matter, there were also micropolitical challenges—local conditions and contexts. Stakeholders had to navigate these local conditions, contexts, and processes through campaign planning and implementation with the hope that Election Day would be one of celebration and not hand-wringing.</p>
<sec id="section10-0013161X12448251">
<title>Local conditions</title>
<p>Informants across all districts were consistent in reporting internal debates over when (and if) to place the levy on the ballot, what type to place on the ballot, and the millage to pursue. But once the decision was made, the boards and superintendents were unanimous in their decision to move forward, presenting a united front to the public (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013161X12448251">Table 2</xref>). As an administrator from District A explained, “There was a lot of hammering behind the scenes about how much, but the board decision was unanimous and it is very important to have that—to have the unanimous vote going in.”</p>
<p>However, less unanimous among the sampled districts was who would assume the chair of the levy campaign committees. Four districts (A, B, C, D) reported difficulties in filling the campaign committee chair position. Only informants from the urban district (E) reported not having this issue. Informants in three districts (A, B, D) reported that the lack of leadership was due to the broader economic conditions and not wanting to spend time on what they assumed would be a tough sell to the community members. However, the superintendent of rural District D offered another reason for a lack of volunteers to chair the local campaign. The superintendent stated, “We all know you want external parents to lead. These people will not lead it in [— School District] because of political reasons. We tried to get people to step up.” The superintendent suggested no one in the community wanted to espouse an increase in property taxes in this largely rural district dominated by large landholding farmers. School board members were reticent to chair, given their position as elected officials; implying that advocacy for and running a campaign could potentially affect their own election outcomes.</p>
<p>Two districts (A and C) reported local controversies leading up to the November campaign, raising concerns that “no voters” would be energized. Interestingly, both these districts (A and C) were able to overcome these issues and win support for their levies by publicly addressing them rather than hoping the issues would just go away. Informants in District A reported three divisive issues. As one informant explained,<disp-quote>
<p>We tore down a historical building over the summer that was 5-6 years in the making. It was a question of what to do with it—to sell it or not . . . It was a lot of emotion. People felt strongly about it. The historical society put out a full page ad. We had people criticizing our plan. The other thing was that we had terminated a long-time principal. He was charged with a felony. So that happened right at the start of the school year. The other issue was contract negotiations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although District A informants did not describe the collective bargaining process as any more or less adversarial than those of the recent past, it was reported as yet another distraction that needed to be addressed, taking up valuable time from campaign planning. There was also the potential for bad press if the negotiations were protracted. With regards to the collective bargaining and building demolition, one district-level informant explained,<disp-quote>
<p>Contracts were settled in June. July is when we had the closing ceremony for the building. We invited everybody in. We had them bring in photographs and stuff like that. I guess it didn’t hurt that we were not announcing the campaign at the same time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the end, District A informants consistently reported that addressing these issues publicly and head-on was the best way to deal with them in advance of the November campaign. An informant explained,<disp-quote>
<p>The building is gone now obviously . . . We thought about putting a structure there, but when we met with the community groups about it, they suggested we leave it open before you start building stuff. So that is what we are going to do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another chimed in stating, “We wanted grass growing [on the lot] by September.” In the case of the dismissal of a building principal, the controversy was handled publicly to the extent that it could, given due process related to personnel dismissals.</p>
<p>District C informants reported that controversy over strained union relations, protracted collective bargaining, and strike threats led to difficulties in finding people willing to serve on the district’s levy committee, to chair it, and raised concerns about the levy’s outcome. The strained union relations and strike threats, in turn, led to strained superintendent–board relations.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, it was the two rural districts (C and D) that both reported having recent appointees to the position of superintendent within their district, strained relations with the school board, tight campaign budgets with very little carryover funds, and having poor relations with media venues. As to experience levels, superintendents from both Districts C and D had 10+ and 20+ years of experience, respectively in education but limited experience in the superintendency (1 and 2 years, respectively).</p>
<p>The rural nature of District C was reported to have influenced which media venues were used in their campaign efforts. Informants stated that because of their location, using the region’s large urban paper was not useful. As the superintendent explained,<disp-quote>
<p>We wrote letters and used mailings sent through our local paper because for us to advertise in [the large metropolitan paper] is a waste money because not everyone gets it out here. We used radio because we wanted to stay away from TV.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When asked why, District C’s superintendent explained that the district’s relations with local network affiliates soured “Because of what happened with the teachers [union negotiations and the strike threats].” The district treasurer confirmed this, but suggested that negative television coverage of this rural district preceded the negotiations between the district administration and teacher union. The treasurer explained,<disp-quote>
<p>Before the teacher situation we had a $500,000 grant that we turned down. Because of the press coverage, people in the district were saying “here we are in financial crisis and the stupid district turned down this money.” The fact of the matter was people in the district had applied for two grants and it was a duplication of grants, but the press does not cover that!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the case of District D, the new superintendent not only had strained relations with the school board, but he also self-reported strained relations with the local press. District D’s superintendent stated,<disp-quote>
<p>I see my role as to keep the machine going, to continue to market and maintain and build relationships with the press—or trying to even though the local press got mad at me because I was sharing with other media. We need to be outside the box here guys. You are a daily paper but you are shrinking. Deal with those politics!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This superintendent, among all five that were interviewed as part of this study, seemed to struggle with stakeholders the most.</p>

<title>The “who” and “what” of campaign participation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12448251">Anderson (1998)</xref> states that “there is general agreement that authentic participatory structures should provide participants with broad jurisdiction, policymaking authority (i.e., not limited to an advisory function), equal representation of relevant stakeholders, and training provisions” (p. 590). As was previously shown, district characteristics, local contexts, and controversies shaped the five sampled districts, making them what they were not only in location but also in a specific period of time. What will now be shown is how these local contexts shaped the districts’ levy campaigns, their broad approaches to stakeholder participation, and what stages of the campaign these stakeholders were involved in.</p>
<p>District A and District B provide examples of two contrasting approaches to community engagement. Both are suburban districts that are very similar in nature of demographics and student performance. While it will be shown that they used some of the same strategies (e.g., phone banks, long-term campaign planning, touting positive student achievement/district performance), the districts differed in broad campaign approaches, specifically seeking to more “authentically” engage community members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12448251">Anderson, 1998</xref>). District A and the Urban District E both chose to run campaigns that sought and used broad support from community members. District A was even able to enlist community members in providing professional marketing and demography/statistical services at no budgetary costs to the district. Districts A and C actively used students in campaign activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0013161X12448251">4</xref></sup> Participation of community stakeholders was at all stages of the campaign, including planning, implementation, and debriefing (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013161X12448251">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Shaded districts won their levy campaigns.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="table-fn8-0013161X12448251">
<label>b.</label>
<p>District level administrators in these districts were reported as being limited to building consensus with school board members for a levy campaign and answering questions at public forums.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>It should be noted that district leadership was not wholly absent from the issue, After all, it was the superintendents, treasurers, and school boards that made the decision to pursue a levy. Because of the nature of school finance in Ohio, district administrators being “political” and “doing PR” are vitally important if levy campaigns are to be successful. However, administrators from Districts A and E chose to be less in front and more in the background. This allowed community campaign committee members the opportunity for leading, planning, and implementing the levy campaign in pursuit of a favorable levy outcome. As the Superintendent of District E put it, “People see principals and teachers as hired guns and community members as legitimate voices, so the more you get them the better.” It is also important to note that even in the districts that heavily engaged community members, there were strategies seeking to minimize the impact of opposition. These were, after all, campaigns that sought a victory for their cause.</p>
<p>As a contrast, District B and D reported running “central office campaigns”—campaigns in which a small number of key school district stakeholders were involved—largely central office administrators. In the case of District B, district-level administrators cited a history of prior successes in the district with such an approach. Only five parents and/or community members were part of the central office campaign in District B. These participants served in the campaign implementation stage only. While a community member was reported as serving as campaign committee chair, informants indicated that administrators at the district and building level did “all the heavy lifting.” The position was honorary and advisory in nature with only nominal participation.</p>
<p>District C’s campaign was an odd mixture of involving parents, community members, and students, but the prolonged contract negotiations, bad press, and high emotions led to deviations from past practices within the district. This included a shorter campaign, a temporary abandonment of particular campaign strategies, and less teacher involvement. With regard to the first, the campaign was planned to be shorter than previous ones in the district. This was to give less time for opponents to mobilize and a time to focus on targeting likely “yes” voters. An informant explained,<disp-quote>
<p>This was probably the meanest we ever won only because of the political position we were in—people being confused and emotional . . . There were a lot of mixed emotions in the community. The campaign was in tune to that. There was a portion of the population that was not for us. We did not direct our campaign toward them, but we did toward the ones who would support us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What resulted was a “quick campaign” that was long in the planning. The district’s long-serving treasurer described the planning as “the most strategic” [she] had ever seen,” with campaign planning reported to have begun in the spring of the previous academic year. The district chose to use select parents and students, making this a campaign that, albeit in a limited fashion, engaged the community. “Typical” campaign tactics were shelved in District C to adapt to the specifics of this campaign. As one informant explained, the use of volunteer community members working in phone banks to make calls to constituents was abandoned in this campaign, “because of the controversy . . . Normally, we would do cold calling, but we wanted the right message out there.” Informants in District C also reported that teachers would typically have been a driving force as leading advocates for levy passage, but in this campaign, teachers were less active as a result of the strained negotiations. The district’s treasurer stated, “The teachers did not support it, but after negotiations some of them got out. Like I said; if it was not for the negotiations they would have been more involved.”</p>
<p>In this section, we have contrasted two broad approaches to community engagement—the community-led campaign (Districts A and E) and the central office campaign (Districts B and D). District C, a rural district whose levy passed, was harder to categorize, given the micropolitical contexts within which it operated (e.g., strained contract negotiations). We have sought to capture what stakeholder groups participated, how many of each stakeholder group were involved, and in what stages of the campaign (planning, implementation, and debriefing) they were involved. We now turn our attention to the wide variety of campaign strategies that were used and finally, what strategies the three winning districts used in comparison to the two districts that lost their campaigns.</p>

<title>Campaign Strategies</title>
<p>In answering our third research question—How did successful districts differ in political strategies from districts that were not successful?—there was a wide range of strategies reported (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013161X12448251">Table 4</xref>). We begin by discussing the strategies that were implemented across the three successful district campaigns or wholly absent in unsuccessful district campaigns (e.g., community campaigns vs. central office campaigns)—what we call contrasting strategies. We then turn our attention to strategies that were, in essence, a “mixed bag”—working in some districts, but not in others. We prioritize these strategies; first examining strategies that were reported across all sampled district regardless of outcome at the polls and providing a nuanced look at what might explain why a mixed-bag strategy yielded the desired outcome in one district and not another.</p>

<p>Shaded districts won their levy campaigns.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>As was alluded to in the previous discussions, the biggest difference between districts that had levies approved and those that did not were the extent to which the campaigns engaged community members. Districts A, C, and E ran community campaigns that, to varying degrees, sought the input and energies of community stakeholders, including students. District B and D, in contrast, ran central office campaigns that, at best, engaged the various stakeholder groups in limited ways.</p>
<p>Our analysis reinforces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12448251">Anderson’s (1998)</xref> contention that the provision of adequate training is a condition and process for authentic community participation. In campaign planning, informants from successful campaigns discussed the importance of adequate message training. The community campaign chairperson from District E stated,<disp-quote>
<p>When we talked to voters we kept the message simple and clear. The message training was such people could repeat it in their sleep. I think that was very helpful. The community members who were making the phone calls were true believers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In unsuccessful districts, there was a message. At its most elemental, it was to support the levy and thus support schools. For example, rural District D’s message was reported as “focus[ing] on being frugal, how cheap the levy was and how important it will be to maintain the programs including the holy trinity—football, band and FFA [Future Farmers of America].” However, informants from unsuccessful districts reported post hoc that adequate message training was absent or woefully inadequate. As one District D informant stated, “Dealing with people who are not trained trying to train other people. It did not go perfect.”</p>
<p>Message training (or message coaching, as one district called it) was consistently described as scheduling time in which volunteers were explained the basics of the levy on the ballot, why the time was right to go on the ballot, the great things that students and teachers were doing, what sacrifices/cuts have already been made, and a list of potential (or specific) cuts that would be made if the levy does not pass. Trainers—a principal, teacher, or community member who had previous experience with levy campaigns—would explain what to expect and typical responses from citizens when calling or doing door-to-door visits. Training sought to ensure a consistent message and how to deal with negative voters. In campaign planning, informants from successful campaigns discussed the importance of adequate message training. In the case of District A, it also included how to collect rudimentary campaign data. During the course of calling and canvassing, adamant “no” voters and “yes” voters were identified. For the former, any further mailings were stopped to save money. For the latter, community members were identified as being supportive, thus receiving a reminder call on Election Day, reminding them to vote.</p>
<p>While four of the five districts (A, B, C, D) reported difficulties in filling the campaign committee chair position, eventually leaders would step up. However, there were differences in who these leaders would be and the eventual levy outcomes. Districts who won at the polls reported having a community member at least co-chair the campaign. District A had a school board member and a parent from the community serve as co-chairs. District C had a parent in the community serve as a chairperson, but was heavily assisted by a district-level support staff member. District E, like District A, had a school board member and a community member serve as co-chairs. District B had a community member serve, but the position was described in terms of an honorary appointment with nominal participation. An informant indicated that all the campaign’s “heavy lifting” was done by administration and central office staff. Likewise, District D used district-level membership. District D’s superintendent, among the five superintendents that we interviewed, rationalized the lack of leadership among community members as to why he and other district-level administrators ran a central office campaign. At times, the superintendent seemed to express a disdain for the school board and for the community that employs him. For example, District D’s superintendent at one point stated, “You know what? People [in the community] are going to find a reason to vote no. People will find a reason not to take the lead too.”</p>
<p>The three districts with winning campaigns also shared another strategy that the two districts with losing campaigns did not—informational websites. Websites funded by community campaign committees and citizen’s donations could be partisan in nature. For example, District A had a website external to the school district that could advocate for a yes vote. District E’s superintendent indicated that his district’s approach was to use the existing website, but provide nonpartisan information. He stated, “We put facts on the school website. We have to be careful [alluding to state law].” Similarly, informants from successful districts used school/central office marquees to publicly advertise nonpartisan “get out the vote” reminders in an effort to remind parents, teachers, and voting age students to vote, but not to vote a particular way.</p>
<p>Informants across the districts discussed the role of creating a sense of urgency in message training (or lack thereof). The two suburban districts (A and B) provide evidence of this dichotomy. District A created a sense of urgency in their community. In advance of the campaign, preemptive cuts to the budget were made. Furthermore, a long list of potential and additional cuts was announced. Informants from District A rationalized this strategy. Announcing specific cuts would only energize voters that had a stake in those programs. This avoided what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12448251">Anderson (1998)</xref> has called participation as collusion, by presenting a wide range of possible cuts that affected as wide a range of stakeholders as possible.</p>
<p>District B’s administratively led, low-key campaign targeted “yes” voters with a positive message (e.g., student performance, sport, and extracurricular offerings) in the hopes of avoiding the mobilization of any opposition. A teacher from District B contrasted the November 2008 campaign with that of the (eventually successful) campaign that followed it. He stated,<disp-quote>
<p>In the November [2008] campaign, we accentuated the positives rather than talk about doom and gloom and what we might lose if this thing didn’t pass. Well that did not work, so the next campaign was the total opposite. The district made substantial cuts and threatened more.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For District B, the urgency only emerged when the November 2008 levy failed. The district had no option but to pursue another levy—a levy that would eventually pass after making preemptive cuts and a long, well-publicized list of additional and potential cuts. Their following campaign would actually model that of District A, involving community members in planning and implementation of the next campaign.</p>
<p>Urgency in the case of District E—the large urban district— also centered on the threat of additional cuts to programming, specifically buses and after-school programming. Like District A, preemptive cuts were already made and publicized followed by a list of more potential cuts. Targeting their message to specific organizations worked for District E. For example, a meeting with sports boosters would include emphasis placed on sports as being on a list of potential cuts. Among African American voters and community organizations, the message was get out the vote and prevent cuts to valuable programs and services. Among Caucasian voters, it was what might result if there were cuts to these programs. The superintendent explained,<disp-quote>
<p>We made it clear that we were going to cut out sports and extracurricular activities and that we would curtail busing—all the nasty things you do. But they are real things too . . . We need extracurricular activities for after school. One of the messages was “Do you want kids hanging around in your back yard?” We hate to say it, but it’s true. Kids need things to do after school. If not, they will be in the neighborhoods.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The message was made clear. A “no vote” could very well lead to even higher crime rates.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12448251">Anderson (1998)</xref> is careful to make a distinction between participation as consumerism and participation as citizenship (p. 584). Only informants from the urban district (District E) discussed the impact that Ohio Edchoice had on district enrollment and finances. Ohio Edchoice provides a limited number of state-funded scholarships to students who attend low-performing public school buildings. The scholarships may be used to attend private schools and community (charter) schools that meet requirements for program participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0013161X12448251">ODE, 2010</xref>). As the treasurer explained, “We talked about the effect of charter schools and Edchoice vouchers on the district . . . Not in a whiny sort of way; just as a matter of fact. We wanted to educate the community.” Another informant explained,<disp-quote>
<p>We have lost a lot to vouchers and charter schools—around 10 million dollars accumulated over time . . . These vouchers; we just can’t make it up. We didn’t lose all the 10 million dollars because we don’t have to teach those kids. It is a lagging indicator I guess . . . so the net loss in effect was about 6.5 million to Edchoice vouchers and charter school. So that is why we needed more from people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Districts A and E also had structured campaign committee and subcommittee systems that increased the likelihood of follow-through on campaign activities. District A, in particular, had a structured door-to-door campaign, in which parents, community members, and students canvassed the entire district. Similar structure and discipline ran across all subcommittees and their accepted tasks. Campaign committees from District A (suburban) and District E (urban) reported brainstorming and identifying public venues in which they could get their message out. This included local events and festivals. District A’s campaign committee used these highly public and well-trafficked events to give out t-shirts and yard signs in exchange for “suggested donation amounts.” The sales of these items were a way to not only get out the vote but to also add to the campaign committee’s financial resources.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12448251">Anderson (1998)</xref> has noted the importance of engaging all relevant stakeholders for community engagement to be “authentic.” District A, in particular, was effective in enlisting the support of community members through the donation of in-kind services, including statistical analysis of Board of Elections data and marketing/printing/mailing services. District A also engaged students in their cause to a greater extent than any other of the sampled districts, primarily in the campaign implementation stage. Students also took limited roles in campaign planning, especially in the realm of Internet social networking (e.g., Facebook)—a venue in which adult stakeholders had either little or no knowledge about. It was in this capacity that District A high school students planned and implemented strategies for energizing voting-age students (current and college-going alumni). These were demographics that campaign committee members realized would be more likely to vote for Obama and for the levy.</p>
<p>Among the sampled districts, District A used the broadest array of strategies in pursuit of levy passage. Other successful districts had strategies that were used only in single districts. For example, District C (rural) used resources for local newspaper advertising. District E’s levy campaign had the resources for a campaign consultant and was successful in gaining the support of local politicians. As the Superintendent put it:<disp-quote>
<p>I really can’t underestimate what the mayor and city council did. It is risky business supporting a levy when you’re a mayor or a city council member. We have a very good working relationship—great respect and admiration. It has been good for us. It has not always been that way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We now turn our attention to the “mixed bag” strategies that were implemented by both successful and unsuccessful districts. We first look at the strategies that were used by all the sampled districts regardless of voter outcomes. These were the use of campaign signs, community informational sessions, nonpartisan voting reminders, and Board of Elections/precinct data. We will start with what is one of the most commonly used levy campaign strategy for getting out the vote—campaign signs. In a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013161X12448251">Johnson &amp; Ingle, 2009</xref>), 73% of responding superintendents reported the use of signage in their levy campaigns. Because of the frequency of levies in Ohio, informants reported keeping unused signs and collecting signs after the campaign was over. These would be stored for what would inevitably be the next campaign. The frequency of campaigns and the desire to make the most of limited resources led to designs that were generic in nature, not specifying what levy or issue number. Signs would simply read something like “Support — Schools.” There was an exception though. In District C, informants reported using “50 dollars for tape to cover [the old election day dates on] old signs.” Informants wondered jokingly if the recycled signs with duct tape on them helped not only in saving money but also in illustrating publicly how tight the budget was (and remains).</p>
<p>Informational sessions were hosted in a variety of public locations (e.g., schools, public library, YMCA) and private residences. As mentioned previously, §9.03 of the Ohio Revised Code allows districts to expend public funds to communicate information, but not to support or oppose the passage of a levy or bond issue. In districts that engaged community members on their levy campaign committees, community members took the partisan “vote yes!” message to those in attendance while district administrators answered questions that were raised. If community members did not take active roles in the campaigns or campaign committee, superintendents and treasurers simply stated that the school board had placed a levy on the ballot and that they would host a public forum to take questions.</p>
<p>Of all the districts, Districts A and E—both successful in their campaigns—used informational sessions most extensively. District A, in particular, kept precise records of all community informational sessions, their locations, who would moderate, and the school board member or district administrator that was present to take questions. In total, District A hosted a total of 21 community informational speakers. Campaign committee members also tracked attendance, which ranged from 5 to 30 attendees. Like District A, informants in District E indicated that campaign committee members typically led the events, with a board member or district administrator in attendance to answer questions. In Districts A and E, central office administrators took low-key roles in planning and implementing the campaigns, leaving the “nuts and bolts” of the campaign to community members. Beyond initial consulting with the school board about the need to proceed with a levy campaign, district-level administrators attended community forums, answered questions, and advised on an as needed basis.</p>
<p>In the case of Districts B, C, and D, informational sessions, “town halls,” and questions and answer sessions were held, but tended to be led by the Superintendent. A school-level administrator from District B reported, “Our Superintendent took part in coffee clutches. We went to homes and churches.” A District C informant stated that during the course of the short campaign, “We had public forums and Q &amp; A during every board meeting.” Likewise, District D’s superintendent reported,<disp-quote>
<p>We had town hall meetings. We talked about the downsizing. We had three different town hall meetings. The first one we had focus groups because we did not want a mob. So focus groups met. At least we did not have a mob of people standing in the back yelling. We diffused that. It ticked them off.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013161X12448251">Malen (1994)</xref> has noted that the suppression of conflict and exclusion of interests result from a number of factors, including administrators’ capacity to control the agenda. This statement from the Superintendent of District D suggests what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0013161X12448251">Meyer and Rowan (1977)</xref> called legitimating rituals, such that on their face, these events provide a venue for community engagement, but the format and input are controlled by district administration. Their efficacy as an opportunity for authentic community participation is questionable. What is less questionable was the outcome—a failed levy in this district.</p>
<p>Informants from all five districts reported the use of nonpartisan “get out the vote” reminders. These were done in a variety of ways, including the use of newsletters, school/central office marquees, e-mail list serves, and school/central office websites. Again, §9.03 of the Ohio Revised Code limited districts to using these media as a means of reminding parents, teachers, and voting-age students to vote, but not to vote a particular way. Their hope was that these stakeholders would be more likely to vote yes. This was not the case for websites funded by community campaign committees and citizen’s donations, which were partisan in nature.</p>
<p>Informants from all five districts also reported the use of Board of Elections/precinct data in campaign strategizing. However, some districts were more strategic in their use of the data, analyzing how and which precincts voted on previous levy issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12448251">Anderson (1998)</xref> identified the use of newsletters and other one-way forms of communication as “participation as public relations” (p. 576). Three districts (A, B, and E) reported the use of targeting mailings to likely “yes voters,” but District E opted to use both targeted mailings and “blanket newsletters” that went out to all households in the district. Of all the sampled districts, suburban District A undertook the most extensive targeting, differentiating mailings based on parental status and age. Elderly voters and those who did not have children in schools received mailings with different messages (quality schools aid in keeping property values high, remaining a “destination district,” and keeping the community’s high quality of life). Parents in the district received these messages too, but the emphasis was on providing quality education and services to their children at current levels without any further cuts. The superintendent of District D also reported a campaign that sought to target potential “yes” voters, rationalizing that:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t want to waste my time going after all the voters. I want to go after the obvious “yes” voters—parents and employees. Spend your time on those groups and parents who are not registered. We identified 1,300 households of parents—1,300 times 2. I should have had 2600 votes . . . Why waste your time on 8,000 people who are not going to show up? I hope they don’t show up!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the end, this did not work for District D, but this strategy was likely blunted by a wide array of factors, including strained relations between the board and superintendent, the superintendent and press, and the superintendent and the public.</p>
<p>The two suburban districts (A and B) both reported the use of Board of Elections data for targeting absentee voters, but with differing election outcomes. Absentee voting was reported to be in higher numbers because of the presidential election. An informant from District B stated, “We really spent time with the absentee voters. When they registered at the board of elections, we sent something out to them within 2 days of when they registered.” A lesson learned by District A informants was to begin even earlier. A campaign committee member stated,<disp-quote>
<p>It would have been nice if we could have started earlier [with absentee voters] and that was something that we were concerned about. In an ideal situation you should shift to accommodate that. I think in future elections we will have to back up the time line.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The superintendent added, “We ran into a handful of people who were like, ‘I wish I would have known. I already voted.’ We heard enough of that kind of thing where that might be a factor in the future.”</p>
<p>Also varying from district to district and yielding mixed results was the amount time spent in campaign planning and implementation. Informants from four of the five districts reported extended campaign planning (3 months or more). Campaign length varied, with Districts A, D, and E reporting campaigns lasting longer than 6 weeks. District B reported a 5- to 6-week campaign. Interestingly, District C reported a purposefully and strategically holding a campaign lasting only 3 to 4 weeks, which also yielded a victory at the polls for its levy.</p>
<p>We conclude our discussion with the remaining “mixed bag” marketing strategies reported by districts (successful or not). All were efforts to market the campaign and encourage constituents to vote yes on the levy. These included touting student academic achievement, the use of phone banks, and the use of media outlets. Among the five districts, the two suburban districts could use a record of strong academic achievement and resulting “excellent with distinction” ratings as part of their message to the voters. Part of their messages was that with levy passage, they could continue this success. Without levy passage, this record of success could be jeopardized.</p>
<p>Three districts (A, B, and E) used “phone banks” to call voters in the district and ask for their support of the levy by a yes vote. District C sought a shortened campaign that eschewed the blanket calling of voters present in previous campaigns. This strategy was viewed as one that would likely energize no voters, given the simmering controversies within the district. The informants from District C suggested that phone banks could potentially do more harm than good.</p>
<p>Three districts—suburban District A, and the two rural districts (C and D)—drew on community members willing to write letters to the editor, advocating that the community at large vote in favor of the levy. The superintendents and treasurers of the two rural districts reported taking part in local radio call in shows to answer questions from the community. Only two districts reported using TV advertising. District E informants reported strong public support from the union, which at the state level is generally supportive of school budget referenda. The campaign chair from District E stated,<disp-quote>
<p>The OEA [Ohio Education Association] developed an advertisement spot. It was sort of a generic spot and they would insert the community name and the issue number. It was paid for by the OEA. The cable channels ran them on the local channels.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>TV advertising was also a strategy used by suburban District B. This entailed using a student-produced video, touting positive aspects of the district, its students and teachers with the hopes that a positive message would encourage a yes vote while remaining within state law. However, the outcomes for these two districts would be mixed—a passed levy for urban District E and a failed levy in suburban District B.</p>

<title>Summary of Findings</title>
<p>This study sought to understand how the macropolitical (state and national) contexts shaped stakeholders’ decision making in terms of campaign strategizing and participation. It also sought to understand how the micropolitical (within district) contexts shaped stakeholder decision making in terms of campaign strategizing and participation. Last, this study asked if successful districts differed in their use political strategies from districts that were not successful. Here, we summarize our findings to these three questions, respectively.</p>
<p>As to the macropolitical contexts, we identified four macropolitical themes consistent across all sampled districts—state campaign policies, state education finance policy, the high profile nature of the Presidential election, and the state of the economy. While the macropolitical themes cut across all five sampled districts, the micropolitical contexts were a mixture of similarities and contrasts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013161X12448251">Mawhinney (1999)</xref> has noted the emphasis on conflict rather than consensus in micropolitical studies. Informants in all districts reported strategies to minimize and suppress conflict with opponents of tax increases. Even districts that more heavily engaged their communities had strategies for targeting yes voters that would hopefully improve the likelihood of winning at the polls while minimizing the impact of no voters. There were efforts to suppress conflict and competing interests, such as District D’s “town halls”—the format of which suppressed angry citizen voices (and only emboldened them further).</p>
<p>Despite a small sample, districts varied greatly in strategies used and community involvement. Districts that heavily engaged community members across the multiple stakeholder groups (including students) and created a sense of urgency yielded greater success at the polls than “central office campaigns.” Districts with co-chairs that included community members with active rather than passive participation fared better than the two districts with failed levies who, in contrast, had administrators chairing or a community chair that was only there in name, but not substance. Adequate message training for campaign participants was also key to success. Its reported absence in the two failed campaigns suggests its importance.</p>
<p>Looking across the five districts and the strategies they implemented (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013161X12448251">Table 4</xref>), one will notice some strategies in common across sampled districts and some that were unique to just one. A simple quantification of strategies suggests that more seemed to matter for the successful districts (A and E), who implemented more than Districts B and D that had failed campaigns. However, District C strategically pursued a shorter campaign that was preceded by months of planning that took into consideration the local conditions and controversies, adjusting accordingly. Their typical strategies used in previous campaigns were strategically unused this time, yielding a win at the polls.</p>
<p>In summary, our study offers important insight into the complexities of the environments and strategies used in levy campaigns. Each campaign is truly a case study of the micropolitics within which the district stakeholders must live and operate. Macropolitical factors in the state of Ohio (particularly its school-funding approach) have forced educators to think and act politically in terms of levy campaigns. One could argue that the macropolitical environment is overemphasizing the political at the expense of what educators are paid to provide and facilitate—teaching and learning.</p>

<title>Implications for Practitioners</title>
<p>Timing levy campaigns with presidential elections has been suggested as increasing the likelihood of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013161X12448251">Fleeter, 2007</xref>). While voter turnout is typically higher in U. S. presidential elections than in state, midterm, and local elections, the conventional wisdom that education issues benefit from high voter turnout may be misguided, given the mixed results from the political science field (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013161X12448251">DeNardo, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0013161X12448251">Nagel &amp; McNulty, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0013161X12448251">Osborn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0013161X12448251">Radcliff, 1994</xref>). Our data suggest that timing will mean nothing if adequate consideration is not given to the macro- and micropolitical realities on the ground.</p>
<p>Our study also suggests that community volunteers—especially student volunteers—can be a valuable resource that is often underused. The value of community volunteers (including students) is for two primary reasons. One has been evidenced in cost analysis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013161X12448251">Ingle, Petroff, &amp; Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013161X12448251">Brent, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013161X12448251">Ingle, Petroff, and Johnson (2011)</xref> found that community volunteers—especially student volunteers—can be a valuable resource in that they incur lower costs than central office campaigns whose administrative salaries drive up opportunity costs. Economically, student volunteerism (and volunteerism in general) reflects very little accounting costs beyond training and recognition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013161X12448251">Ingle, Petroff, &amp; Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013161X12448251">Brent, 2000</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0013161X12448251">5</xref></sup>). But as an informant from District E cogently explained, community members are more likely to be perceived as “legitimate voices” that can energize public support for levy campaigns.</p>
<p>Returning to student volunteerism, this study provided some evidence that students have valuable knowledge and skill sets (e.g., social networking) that added value to one district’s campaign efforts. Their knowledge and skill sets were reported by informants in this study and by others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013161X12448251">Hollander &amp; Longo, 2008</xref>) as assisting to energize voters, particularly among their demographic, who tended to vote Democratic in the November 2008 Presidential campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013161X12448251">Caswell, 2009</xref>). Their vote also trended in favor of the levy in their districts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0013161X12448251">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>District personnel and/or campaign committee members should plan for effective volunteer training and recognition when planning a district’s campaign. As to the first, emphasis should be on maximizing volunteer utility by adequately preparing volunteers in message training. This entails sending a consistent message that is thoughtfully formulated for delivery in activities, such as door-to-door campaigns, community festivals, and/or town hall meetings. Districts may also consider targeting messages to specific stakeholder groups within their district, presenting their communities with extensive lists of services, programs (e.g., extracurricular), and positions that might be cut if the levy were to fail. This is opposite of listing specific cuts, which may not pique the interest and concern of all voters. Such specificity may only energize subpopulations within the district that have vested interests in those programs.</p>
<p>The second is recognition programs, which as will be shown below, is related to message training. Given the propensity of Ohio districts to be on the ballot with regularity, recognition programs are a means by which community volunteers with prior levy campaign experience can be encouraged to return for future campaigns. Stakeholders who have prior experience in levy campaigns can be a valuable resource in training new volunteers, providing valuable insight into what to expect when the new recruits canvas neighborhoods. Their experience can add value to future campaign efforts. Volunteer recognition can thus be as an investment in the district’s future campaign efforts.</p>
<p>This study provides a glimpse into the windows of five districts, the macro/micropolitical environments in which districts operate and the efforts that districts and individuals put forth in pursuit of additional or status quo funding for schools. Research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013161X12448251">Ingle, Petroff, &amp; Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013161X12448251">Ingle, Johnson, &amp; Petroff, 2011</xref>) has estimated the total cost of campaigns in districts. Given all these efforts on individual campaigns, one wonders whether all these efforts and resources could be redirected into a statewide push for broader school finance reform that allows for automatic inflationary increases in local property taxes? In sum, they have. Organizations such as the Ohio School Boards Association have historically advocated for school finance reform, including the call for legislation that “provides for inflationary growth to ensure an adequate and equitable funding system for Ohio’s public schools . . . [and] funding growth adequate to address revenue needs without requiring voter approval of new tax levies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0013161X12448251">Ohio School Boards Association, 2011</xref>). Likewise, the Ohio Education Association has also historically challenged state lawmakers to change how schools are funded in Ohio (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0013161X12448251">Ohio Education Association, 2011a</xref>) while also working to defeat Governor Kasich’s Issue 2—a referenda on legislation, which sought, among other things, to change how teachers are paid, limit public sector collective bargaining rights, and increase public employees’ retirement contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0013161X12448251">Ohio Education Association, 2011b</xref>). We recommend that school/district personnel, school boards, and Ohio voters <italic>continue</italic> to advocate for such changes and <italic>renew</italic> their advocacy for statewide changes to school finance in Ohio and challenge policymakers to address an issue that they have thus far avoided—the unconstitutionality of Ohio school-funding approach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0013161X12448251">7</xref></sup> We offer some suggestions to policymakers below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0013161X12448251">
<title>Implications for Policy Makers</title>
<p>While there are no quick fixes in education funding, policy makers in Ohio must take steps to address problems in Ohio’s approach to funding education. There are some potential policy responses that policy makers could consider. The provisions of Ohio H.B. 920, which severely limit the growth of school district revenues as property values rise, became part of the Ohio constitution through voter referendum in 1980. One way to mollify the effects of H.B. 920 would be through a constitutional amendment allowing for tax revenue growth for school districts. This change would benefit local governments in Ohio, but especially school districts, reducing the number and frequency of ballot issues. Unfortunately, given the current political climate in Ohio, any such referendum would have difficulty getting on the ballot, let alone prevailing in a statewide referendum.</p>
<p>Property tax circuit breakers could provide tax relief to low-income and elderly residents whose taxes exceed a given percentage of income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013161X12448251">Allen &amp; Woodberry, 2006</xref>). Along the same lines, property tax deferral programs are designed to allow eligible homeowners the option of delaying the payment of property taxes until the home is sold or the owner’s estate is settled and are typically targeted to the elderly and the disabled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013161X12448251">Haveman &amp; Sexton, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of a state Supreme Court ruling that Ohio’s school-funding formula is overly reliant on the use of local property taxes, it seems unlikely that Ohio is poised to move away from property taxes to any great degree in the near future. Besides, there are those who argue that voting on local property taxes keep citizens connected to their local schools—that this is a means of community engagement and democracy in action. Governor Strickland’s efforts to increase the state’s share of the funding formula was based on a foundation amount that many believed was too low to begin with and was to be phased in over a 10-year period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0013161X12448251">Phillis, 2009</xref>). With the election of Republican governor, John Kasich, and a Republican-controlled legislature, there is less state funding earmarked for local districts in the biennial budget. The burden will remain on local taxpayers to make up the difference. The need for districts to frequently be on the ballot will likely not go away any time soon. Given the expanded role over time of the federal government in public education (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0013161X12448251">McDonnell, 2005</xref>), one wonders whether we are seeing a shift in public opinion in regards to funding of public education, such that local communities are more supportive of federal funding of education rather than continuing to foot the lion’s share of tax revenue.</p>

<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>As mentioned previously, an obvious limitation of this five-district case study is its lack of generalizability. A remedy to this limitation is to quantitatively examine the relationship between implemented campaign strategies and expenditures on levy outcomes over time. The biggest challenge would be gaining access to knowledgeable individuals in districts who can report campaign strategies and specific expenditures accurately. Given the sheer number of districts on the ballot in any given year in Ohio, this is no small task. A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013161X12448251">Johnson &amp; Ingle, 2009</xref>) surveyed superintendents on the use of campaign strategies and testing their relationship with a dichotomous outcome, but the study was limited in its generalizability to one point in time (November 2007). Ideally, superintendents and/or campaign committee chairs would be surveyed whenever there is a levy on the ballot (in Ohio, there are four periods of time in a year). Over time, longitudinal data combining district variables and survey responses could be gathered to test the efficacy of these strategies and expenditures. However, there is a practical consideration that currently serves as a hindrance to this. Superintendents already suffering from “levy fatigue” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013161X12448251">Johnson &amp; Ingle, 2009</xref>) would likely suffer from survey fatigue as well.</p>

<p>Under Ohio’s accountability system, districts are rated using multiple measures, including performance on state indicators, a performance index score, Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), and value-added data. The performance index and value-added results recognize the achievement levels of students as well as progress over time. School and districts are designated as “Excellent with Distinction,” “Excellent,” “Effective,” “Continuous Improvement,” “Academic Watch,” or “Academic Emergency.” The “Excellent with Distinction” designation was new to the 2007-2008 Local Report Card. This designation is earned when a school or district has been designated “Excellent” and exceeds value-added goals for 2 consecutive years.</p>

<p>It should be noted that District B also used students but in a passive and limited basis. Specifically, students from a media class put together an informational commercial for local cable broadcasting. The video highlighted positive things that the district, educators, and students had done (or were doing). This activity was part of a class assignment and per Ohio Revised Code, could not advocate specifically for a “Yes” vote.</p>
