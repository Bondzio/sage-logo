The changes in the swelling index and the mechanical properties have been reported with respect to the control sample. After reinforcing nanoclays into HNBR there was good resistance to swelling in all the three different liquid mediums in comparison to control sample.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the recent years, there has been a great interest in the development and usage of hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR). This is due to the unique ability of HNBR to retain its physical properties even after exposure to oil and chemicals at high temperatures of around 150°C.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095244311429736">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095244311429736">2</xref>
</sup> Apart from the above properties, HNBR is considered as the replacement to other rubbers due to its low-temperature flexibility, high static and dynamic mechanical strength and good resistance to abrasion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095244311429736">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095244311429736">2</xref>
</sup> These unique properties have resulted in more usage of HNBR in automotive industries and specialized industrial applications such as oil drilling and roll covers. However, there is a huge demand from the industry to develop the material to withstand high temperatures in various environments with the view of extending the service life of rubber. The most common method of improving the resistance to ageing and chemicals is by the addition of inorganic fillers like carbon black and silica. Also, it is well known that addition of some of the antidegradants<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095244311429736">3</xref>

</sup> and metal oxides<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095244311429736">6</xref>
</sup> to the formulation results in improved protection against ageing in contact with fluids.</p>
<p>However, HNBR is susceptible to degradation which arises during service when exposed over a period of time to various environments. This degradation in the rubber composites might result in changes in the mechanical properties due to oxidative environment. This change leads to the increase in cross-links and thereby resulting in increased hardness and reduced tensile strength and elongation at break.</p>
<p>Since the successful demonstration of significant improvement in mechanical properties by Toyota researchers,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095244311429736">7</xref>
</sup> polymer/nanofillers have drawn attention in the industrial sector in various applications. Nanofillers possess a high aspect ratio and are slowly being considered as a substitute for replacing the traditional fillers. Significant improvement in the mechanical properties has been observed using small amount of filler loadings (&lt;10 wt%). In comparison, very large amounts of conventional fillers are incorporated to improve the properties. Of the nanofillers, nanolayered silicates or nanoclays are one of the most commonly used inorganic clay minerals for reinforcing the polymer matrices on the nanoscale level.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095244311429736">8</xref>
</sup> These silicate layers have the ability to exfoliate in the polymer matrix at nanoscale level and derive unexpected improvement in hybrid properties which are not commonly observed in the conventional microcomposites.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095244311429736">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nanolayered silicates belong to the general family of 2:1 phyllosilicates. Montmorillonite (MMT) is the most commonly used inorganic clay minerals for reinforcing the polymer matrices on the nanoscale level.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095244311429736">9</xref>
</sup> These nanolayered silicates consist of several stacks of silicate layers having an approximate thickness of around 1 nm with high length to diameter ratio. Due to their small size, they possess a large internal surface energy and have a tendency to agglomerate due to van der Waals forces. The pristine MMT which is hydrophylic in nature is not compatible with most of the polymer matrices. The layered silicates are rendered hydrophobic by exchanging with cations the alkyl ammonium ions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095244311429736">10</xref>
</sup> This modification of silicate layers makes it more compatible with the polymer matrices, thereby resulting in exfoliation of clay platelets.</p>
<p>Several researchers have recently demonstrated the improvement of thermal stability of plastics<sup>

</sup> after incorporating nanoclays. Despite the substantial previous research work on thermal stability of various polymer/clay nanocomposites, there is little report on the ageing behaviour of rubber/clay nanocomposites. Recently, Bhowmick et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095244311429736">17</xref>
</sup> have reported on accelerated air aging of HNBR/clay nanocomposites at different temperatures and some of the probable mechanism. Hence much more attention needs to be given to this field. The current work is motivated by this need. The main aim of the present work is evaluating the effect of nanoclay on the ageing behaviour of HNBR at different environments. The focus of this research is to study the effect of thermal ageing in air and three different fluid environments versus time and temperature. The three different fluid mediums used are IRM 901, IRM 903 and Liquid B. The different mediums are chosen in order to study the behaviour of nanocomposites at different atmospheric conditions. It is for the first time the comparisons of behaviour of the nanocomposites in different environments are studied. Also swelling behaviour and possible mechanism in all the three fluid mediums have been reported. The effect of the ageing and swelling on the tensile strength and elongation at break is also investigated for all the nanocomposites and compared with the control samples.</p>

<title>Preparation of HNBR/C15A nanocomposites</title>
<p>HNBR/C15A nanocomposites were prepared by conventional mechanical shear mixing technique. Addition of organoclays to HNBR was done by two different methods, namely direct addition of clays and use of ultrasonically predispersed rubber/clay masterbatch. The amount of clay addition used in this investigation is 5 phr (parts per hundred parts of rubber) for different methods. More details about optimization of the clay levels can be found elsewhere.<sup>

<p>HNBR/C15A nanocomposites were prepared using a laboratory scale Francis Shaw K0 intermix. The dry organoclays and the predispersed HNBR/C15A masterbatch were added directly to the mixer along with the other rubber compounding materials. The material dropped out from the mixer was passed through a two-roll mill. The milled compound was cooled down to room temperature overnight before curing. The rubber test sheet samples were cured for 6 min at 185°C as per International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 471.</p>

<title>Air ageing studies</title>
<p>The ageing properties of various prepared nanocomposites were studied with respect to the control sample tested at temperature of 150°C for a period of 168 h. The properties of air-aged nanocomposite samples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244311429736">Figure 1</xref>. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244311429736">Figure 1(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244311429736">b</xref>), we can observe that there is a marginal decrease in the tensile strength and elongation at break after ageing for a period of 168 h. The tensile strength and elongation are reduced by 16.5% and 23.1%, respectively, compared to its original value. These reductions in the properties are due to partial cross-linking of the elastomer backbone and degradation of the rubber taking place upon ageing as observed by some of the researchers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095244311429736">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095244311429736">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095244311429736">24</xref>
</sup> It needs to be noted that with the increase in temperature, there is more cross-linking of the polymer chain and the filler. Once the cross-linking becomes fairly high, there is possibility of restriction to the orientation process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095244311429736">25</xref>
</sup> The restriction in chain mobility during tensile testing might have also led to the reduction in tensile strength. Whereas with freeze-dried (FD) nanocomposite sample, there is not much loss or change in the tensile properties observed under the same testing conditions. The loss in tensile and elongation for FD nanocomposites is around 7.9% and 18.5%, respectively, in comparison to its original value. Similarly with masterbatch (MB), AS and SS set of nanocomposites, the observed change in the tensile strength are by 7%, 5.8% and 3.5%, respectively, and change in elongation at break values are by 16.4%, 14.9% and 12.8%, respectively. These results clearly indicate that the nanocomposites retain most of the properties upon air ageing. Similar sort of observation has been reported by Choudhury et al.<sup>

<p>The changes in the tensile properties upon ageing could be due to several reasons such as change in the morphology of the system; degradation of rubber and cross-linking; and change in the level of interaction between components at elevated temperatures. Here we try to explain more about the possible reasons for changes in the mechanical properties due to the above-mentioned reasons. Upon ageing, it has been documented in the literatures that surface morphology of the rubber samples changes drastically due to surface oxidation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095244311429736">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095244311429736">23</xref>
</sup> These authors have reported the presence of surface cracks due to oxidation upon ageing. Our microscopy observations confirm these reports. This reason might have led to more reduction in the tensile properties as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244311429736">Figure 1(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244311429736">b</xref>). Also, with the use of nanoclays, the minimal change in the properties can be attributed to the fact that C15A provides more protection to the oxidation on the surface of the rubber samples. Choudhury et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095244311429736">17</xref>
</sup> have shown less change in the morphology of the nanocomposite samples through their atomic force microscopy studies. It is worth to point out that with regard to the samples containing silanes that is AS and SS, the change in properties is much more minimal. Some explanation as the possible reason behind this minimal change in the properties is given here. AS consists of amine molecules. Amines are very effective in preventing long-term oxidative degradation. This is one of the reasons for using antidegradants-containing amines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095244311429736">26</xref>
</sup> Also this might be one of the reasons behind the retention of mechanical properties after ageing with AS nanocomposites. Sulphido molecules in the silane (SS) can easily graft on to the diene monomers during processing and curing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095244311429736">26</xref>
</sup> Thermal decomposition of sulphide molecules gives rise to free radicals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095244311429736">26</xref>
</sup> These radicals can dehydrogenate and result in stabilization of polymer chains.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095244311429736">26</xref>
</sup> In our research reported elsewhere, we have observed improved storage time in the elastomers with more cross-linking effect with the use of SS.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095244311429736">20</xref>
</sup> All these factors might have together led to providing superior resistance to ageing after the use of SSs. Bender et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095244311429736">1</xref>
</sup> have reported in detail about the mechanism behind the degradation of HNBR upon ageing. They report that the vinyl carbonyl is formed from peroxide with a loss of water molecule. This attack of oxygen molecule on the diene part of elastomer results in the oxidative degradation. They have also noted that the peroxy radicals in the presence of oxygen abstracts hydrogen molecule leading to hydroperoxides at high temperatures. These hydroperoxides result in oxidation, leading to ketones, carboxylic acids and alcohols which in turn results in the formation of ester links. As a result, it results in huge reduction in the properties of standard HNBR sample. Choudhury et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095244311429736">17</xref>
</sup> through their studies have reported that nanoclays protect the samples from oxidative reaction. In summary, our findings with respect to ageing studies match with the observations found by Choudhury et al. and Bender et al.</p>

<title>Swelling and immersion studies in various liquid mediums</title>
<p>In our study, three different liquid mediums namely IRM 901, IRM 903 and Liquid B, each simulating different oils that could come in contact with the nanocomposites in actual field applications are considered. The results from the study of the interaction of the vulcanized nanocomposite rubbers with these mediums are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095244311429736">Figure 2(a–c)</xref>. The effects of the above-mentioned oils or fluids on the nanocomposites were judged from the swelling index of a 30 mm × 20 mm × 2 mm specimens immersed for a period of 168 h at 150°C for IRM 901 and IRM 903 mediums and at 40°C for Liquid B medium. The results of swelling index of nanocomposites in comparison to the standard sample for different mediums can then be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095244311429736">Figure 2(a–c)</xref>. Swelling index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095244311429736">Figure 2</xref>) clearly shows a very good resistance to different fluid mediums with the incorporation of nanoclays. The reduced solvent uptake of nanocomposites can be explained by the following factors—formation of a three-dimensional network during vulcanization, uniform dispersion and exfoliation of thin silicate platelets of nanoclays throughout the rubber matrix and strong interfacial bonding of silicate layers onto the elastomer chains. These above-mentioned factors might have created a difficult path for the transport of solvent to some extent through the interface. Also, it is to be noted that with silane-treated nanocomposites (AS and SS samples), there is further reduction in swelling index. This clearly suggests that there is further interlocking of rubber and clay platelets in the matrix. These results are a clear indication of efficient interfacial bonding in various mediums.</p>
<p>Tensile tests have been carried out after immersing the nanocomposite samples to evaluate the effect of incorporation of nanoclays with respect to mechanical properties. The results of tensile tests after immersion in IRM 901, IRM 903 and Liquid B mediums are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0095244311429736">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0095244311429736">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0095244311429736">5</xref>, respectively. We can observe that there is a loss in tensile strength in the control sample by 12%, 20.1% and 41.3%, respectively, and loss in elongation at break by 13.8%, 14.2% and 30.2%, respectively, for IRM 901, IRM 903 and Liquid B mediums with respect to the original values at room temperature. But with the incorporation of FD nanoclays, the change in properties with respect to the original values has come down to 8.9%, 13.6% and 34.3% for tensile strength and 7.3%, 1.7% and 20.3% for elongation at break for IRM 901, IRM 903 and Liquid B mediums, respectively. With the use of silanes, it is interesting to observe that there is no loss in the tensile strength in IRM 901 and IRM 903 liquid mediums where it is retaining all the strength even after immersing for a period of 168 h. The observed loss in tensile strength after immersing in liquid B was found to be around 28%. Again with respect to change in elongation properties, we observed the change by around 4.1%, 3.3% and 19.2% for IRM 901, IRM 903 and Liquid B, respectively. These results clearly indicate that there is no deterioration in the mechanical properties after immersion in various different mediums having different solubility indexes. Of all the samples, SS samples outperform other set of samples in all the three different mediums. The following section presents a discussion explaining the results obtained for the swelling and ageing tests.</p>

<p>The swelling of a rubber by a liquid is like a mixing process, that is two substances mix when the free energy of mixing is negative. The free energy of mixing is negative, if the change in enthalpy is less than the product of absolute temperature and the change in entropy as given by the Gibbs equation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095244311429736">27</xref>
</sup> In simple terms, mixing is favoured by minimum or negative enthalpy change and maximum entropy change.</p>
<p>Here we try to explain the mechanism behind improved resistance to the diffusion of liquid through the bulk rubber. Starmer<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095244311429736">27</xref>
</sup> mentions that the two main possible mechanisms for this improvement in diffusion are through rubber–liquid interface. The first mechanism being the amount of bound acrylonitrile content and the other mechanism related to swelling level. The later mechanism that is the swelling level is completely dependent on the cross-links between the polymer and fillers. Starmer explains the above swelling mechanism with the help of Gaussian curves.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095244311429736">27</xref>
</sup> According to their findings, swelling levels are the driving force which controls the diffusion of liquid through rubber when compared to acrylonitrile content.</p>
<p>These factors are more explained and discussed in the following section. First, we will consider the factors relating to the rubber itself. The restraining force on the swelling is the elastic retractive force of the network, which in turn is related to the cross-link density. Broutelles and Opigez<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095244311429736">28</xref>
</sup> have predicted and shown that the swelling is inversely proportional to the average molecular weight between the cross-links <italic>M</italic>
<sub>c</sub>. Accordingly, we can comment that smaller the value of <italic>M</italic>
<sub>c</sub>, lower is the volume change, clearly suggesting more and tighter cross-linking. This is in agreement with the conclusion that the more tightly cross-linked nanocomposites (AS and SS) give a lower value of swelling index (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095244311429736">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095244311429736">Table 1</xref>).

<p>IRM 901 is an aliphatic liquid medium containing acidic sites like the carbonyl groups, ethers and alcohols. It can be clearly seen (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095244311429736">Figure 2b</xref>) that the swelling appears to be limited compared to the other two mediums. This is mainly because the acidic sites of the aliphatic mediums are more acting on the carbon atom rather than the acrylonitrile atoms in the HNBR rubber.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095244311429736">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>IRM 903 is an aromatic-based liquid. It contains the aromatic bases such as benzene, toluene, xylene and so on. Here the base interactions are greater due to the dispersion forces and the acid–base functions. These bases attack more on acrylonitrile molecules and hence cause more swelling as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095244311429736">Figure 2(b)</xref>. Also, Fowkes et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095244311429736">29</xref>
</sup> mention that if the dispersion forces are dominant, the mixing will be endothermic. whereas if the acid–base forces are dominant, the mixing will be exothermic.</p>
<p>Liquid B is a medium which can be considered as an associated liquid. That is it can contain both acidic and basic sites. As a result, there is an opportunity for acid–base interactions to occur between two or more like molecules. Thus, the liquid consists of agglomerates or associations of the molecules rather than the individual molecules. If self-association is favoured over any intermolecular interactions, the liquid will persist as the associated form in the presence of other molecules. This might be one of the reasons for HNBR composites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095244311429736">Figure 2c</xref>) having higher volume swell than that of the other two liquid mediums.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The current investigation brings out some of the advantages of reinforcing organoclays into HNBR. The improved stability of nanocomposites has been compared with the control sample after subjecting it to thermal ageing in air and three different fluid environments versus time and temperature. The nanocomposites were aged for a period of 168 h at 150°C in air and liquid mediums like IRM 901, IRM 903 and Liquid B. The nanocomposites showed retention of physical and mechanical properties even after subjecting it to ageing process. The swelling index studies show lower solvent uptake after reinforcing nanoclays into HNBR. This clearly indicates the good interfacial bonding between the silicate layers and the elastomer chains. In summary, the current investigation shows that nanoclays find a potential use for developing novel materials in different range of applications.</p>
