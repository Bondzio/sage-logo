<p><italic>Cavell, Companionship, and Christian Theology</italic></p>
<p>Peter Dula</p>
<p>Oxford: Oxford University, 2011. 289 pp. $65.00</p>
<p>An assistant professor at Eastern Mennonite University, Peter Dula gives us the first book to trace the relevance of Stanley Cavell’s magisterial <italic>oeuvre</italic> to Christian theology. The focus on companionship points back to Aristotle’s view of the friend as one’s other self, a source of self-knowledge and betterment, and points forward to Cavell’s sketch of “moral perfectionism,” where conversation with the friend (an informal but trusty mentor, as it were) is the key to finding one’s “next self” on an interminable path through mutuality and adversity. The book moves through eight chapters from “Companionship and Community in Cavell and MacIntyre” to discussions of Martha Nussbaum and John Rawls, to a chapter on Cavell’s “Apophatic Anthropology” and a marvelous final chapter, “The Truly Human.”</p>
<p>Dula asks what it can mean for Cavell to write, “The crucified body is our best picture of the unacknowledged human soul” (219). He worries through the theological undercurrents in passages that at first seem unrelated to theological concerns. For example, Cavell poignantly supposes that we have not mastered, or we have forgotten, or we have distorted, or we have learned through fragmented models, the forms of life which could make utterances like “God exists” or “God is dead” or “I love you” or “I cannot do otherwise” or “Beauty is but the beginning of terror” bear all the weight they could carry, express all they could take from us. We do not know the meaning of the words. We look away or leap around. (161) Cavell gives us glancing theological <italic>apercu</italic> amidst the great body of his work on literature, cinema, and philosophy. Dula’s delicate task is to provide intricate and suggestive staging that brings Cavell’s intermittent theological voice into resonance with full-time theologians. Accordingly, he lets Cavell’s <italic>apercu</italic> bounce off the scaffolding of Karl Barth, Rowan Williams, and Stanley Hauerwas, as well as Augustine and Søren Kierkegaard. Quite apart from its illumination of Cavell’s streams of thought, I find his staging of these theologians persistently provocative.</p>
<p>Cavell’s writing famously engages philosophical skepticism, which can be seen as a failure to acknowledge creation or the world or the neighbor. He traces the tendrils of such skepticism into the domains of literature (Thoreau and Shakespeare, for example) and of cinema and opera. As Dula follows these tendrils, he brings Cavell’s often passing theological remarks into fertile articulation. If we are post-secular, we are ready to hear theological whispers and provocations just beneath the surface of discussions that may seem purely literary, philosophical, or cinematic. Cavell hears theological rings in Shakespeare’s <italic>King Lear</italic> and Samuel Beckett’s <italic>Endgame.</italic> In <italic>Little Did I Know</italic> (Stanford, 2010), his episodic autobiographical remarks are cast as redemptive, perhaps shadows of full-dress theology.</p>
<p>For Cavell, redemption is not exactly from sin but from fantasy or forgetfulness. Redemptive writing stems flights from self-knowledge and self-exposure, flights into despair. The modern is marked by restless disorientation in a world increasingly volatile and violent, vexed by skepticisms about others, values, our place among things, and the worth of the human. For Cavell, skepticism becomes a refusal of the other and is thus continuous with flights from the self-exposure that acknowledgement of the other would require. Redemptive writing (and opera and cinema) aim to counter flights into despairing isolation.</p>
<p>Dula traces Cavell’s discussions of the shaping of moral identity through the give and take of intimate conversation. Here, Hollywood comedies of remarriage and Emersonian essays can illuminate. Dula is haunted by the question of framing theological thought—in what media, with what degree of conviction (or stammering), for what sort of community? If we’ve lost confidence in the reality of the human, then we’ve lost contexts where words can mean something, can take our breath away, can be prophetic or confessional or witnessing.</p>
<p>Some of Dula’s most telling theological interpretations occur in his discussions of the novelist W.G. Sebald’s shattered worlds—photographed, narrated, de-memorialized, and haunted. Sebald suffers the disruptions of memory in Germany during and immediately after World War II, and their present reverberations. Loss of memory and speech is the eclipse of God. With Cavell and Sebald, Dula wonders how the extent of this eclipse can be registered without succumbing to irremediable despair. Yet, despite its brush with loss, this deeply searching work does not leave us in loss. It is a brilliant and memorable gift.</p>
