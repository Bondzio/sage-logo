<p>The prevalence of malnutrition in critically ill pediatric patients has been well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112442548">1</xref></sup> Early nutrition support is an integral part of the care of critically ill children. Early enteral nutrition (EN) is associated with significant advantages over late EN or parenteral nutrition (PN). It improves nitrogen balance and prevents bacterial translocation and gut mucosal atrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112442548">2</xref></sup> However, adequate EN is often not achieved as gastric feeds are often not tolerated in critically ill children. The reduction in gastric motility that frequently occurs in critically ill patients due to the use of sedatives or injury itself often leads to poor tolerance of nasogastric feeds with excessive gastric residuals and abdominal distention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112442548">3</xref></sup> Placing postpyloric feeding tubes can be difficult in critically ill children. Spontaneous transpyloric passage of standard feeding tubes after 24 hours without endoscopic intervention or use of anesthesia can range from 30%−80% and does not seem to be affected by tip profile or weight added to the tip of the feeding tube.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112442548">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>We report on our experience with a 14Fr polyurethane self-advancing jejunal feeding tube (Tiger2; Cook Medical, Inc, Bloomington, IN) in a pediatric population. The tube is designed with flaps to gently drag the catheter into the jejunum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112442548">Figure 1</xref>). These tubes have been used in the adult population with success,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112442548">5</xref></sup> but to our knowledge, there have been no reports of its use in the pediatric age group.</p>

<title>Case Series</title>
<p>We present 7 critically ill patients 8–19 years old, admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), in whom prolonged recovery, inability to tolerate gastric feeds because of marked sedation, and dependence on ventilator were predicted at the outset. Patient demographics and diagnoses are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112442548">Table 1</xref>. The self-advancing jejunal feeding tube was successfully placed on first attempt at the bedside in all 7 patients within the first 24 hours without the use of a promotility agent or anesthesia. The tubes were placed by the PICU personnel, including nurses, residents, and attendings, following the instructions outlined by the manufacturer. The feeding tube was initially positioned in the stomach, and its location was confirmed with the use of insufflation and auscultation. The tube was loosely taped at the nare, leaving approximately 30 cm slack to allow for the patient’s own peristalsis and feeding tube’s flaps to advance the catheter. Centimeter markings from 40–100 cm provided visual confirmation of tube position. Once the 80- to 100-cm mark was reached, an abdominal X-ray was obtained to confirm the tube’s position. Radiograph confirmed the tip of the tube in the third portion of duodenum in all 7 patients at 23 hours of placement.</p>

<p>Following tube placement, continuous feedings were initiated with age-appropriate enteral formula. Feedings were initiated at a rate of 10 mL/h and were advanced by 5–10 mL/h until the feeding rate goal was achieved. Feeds were advanced at the discretion of the members of the PICU team based on the child’s age and observed feeding tolerance. The feeding rate goal was calculated to provide a daily caloric goal based on age, body weight, and recommended daily allowances of macro- and micronutrients.</p>
<p>Nutrition goals achieved within 48 hours of placement of the postpyloric feeding tube were measured and reported for each patient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112442548">Table 1</xref>). The goal was to provide full caloric needs. All patients reached at least 70% of their goal calories within 48 hours of the feeding tube placement. Five patients who did not reach 100% of their goal calories within 48 hours had multiple interruptions for procedures and radiological studies deemed necessary by the PICU team. None required PN support.</p>
<p>In all children reported, none had evidence of aspiration pneumonia or feeding intolerance after placement of the self-advancing jejunal feeding tube despite being mechanically ventilated and sedated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112442548">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0148607112442548">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Early EN is considered to be nutrition support that starts within 24–48 hours after admission to the intensive care unit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112442548">3</xref></sup> Early EN has been shown to increase protein intake, resulting in improved protein balance, which is desirable during the acute phase of the stress response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112442548">6</xref></sup> The PICU environment poses unique challenges to achieving nutrition goals for the critically ill child. Fasting for procedures and poor tolerance of feeds are both reasons for slow enteral advancement in the PICU. The nutrition support achieved in critically ill patients is determined by the ability to advance the rate of delivery of feeds until the goal is achieved. Postpyloric EN enables a relatively rapid initiation of nutrition support and permits a greater increase in the rate of administration of feeds, reaching caloric goals earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112442548">3</xref></sup> Our case series support the above-mentioned findings, demonstrating that critically ill children on mechanical ventilation fed via the small bowel were able to achieve a greater percentage of their daily caloric goal (87% ± 12%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112442548">Table 1</xref>) as compared with previously published experience with gastric feeds in critically ill children (30% ± 23%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112442548">7</xref></sup> Gastric feeds were not considered prior to jejunal feeding tube placement in our patients because of marked sedation and dependence on high ventilator settings.</p>
<p>As previously reported, postpyloric EN rarely requires interruptions from routine nursing maneuvers such as postural changes, hygiene, and physiotherapy, permitting continued administration of calories to goal requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112442548">3</xref></sup> Several studies have also demonstrated that a significant difference exists between the volume of nutrition prescribed and actually administered in a considerable percentage of critically ill patients fed by the gastric route.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112442548">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>A variety of techniques for placing tubes beyond the pylorus have been described, including the use of stylets, weighted tube tips, magnets, and mechanical manipulations of the tube during placement. These techniques have success rates of 33%−83% in adult patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112442548">4</xref></sup> Studies have shown that fluoroscopic-assisted transpyloric feeding tube placement has an 85%−97% success rate but requires the transport of a potentially unstable patient to the radiology suite, involves exposure to radiation, and is expensive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112442548">9</xref></sup> A study of endoscopic placement of transpyloric feeding tubes found a 90% success rate, but this technique required a skilled endoscopist and was associated with significant costs along with the risk of anesthesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112442548">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many strategies have been developed to increase the success rate for placement of feeding tubes in the small bowel. The prokinetic agents, metoclopramide and erythromycin, have been studied extensively. Results with metoclopramide have been inconsistent, but erythromycin does improve success rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112442548">11</xref></sup> However, metoclopramide and erythromycin can both cause undesirable side effects. There continues to be a need for a rapid, simple, and inexpensive bedside method to place feeding tubes in the small bowel. Our experience in children with the self-advancing jejunal feeding tube demonstrates that it can be easily placed by any individual previously trained in nasogastric tube placement at the patient’s bedside. In our case series, the jejunal feeding tubes were placed on first attempt without any complications and self-advanced to the small bowel within 24 hours without the use of a prokinetic agent, endoscopic intervention, or anesthesia.</p>

<sec id="section3-0148607112442548">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The self-advancing jejunal feeding tube can be used effectively to establish early EN in critically ill children in the first 48 hours after placement. The tube does have its limitations: having a 14Fr diameter limits its use in infants and toddlers. Its high success rate in postpyloric placement shows promise as a simple and noninvasive method of bedside feeding tube placement in children. Further investigation is needed to determine if this modality can help to decrease the number of patients requiring PN.</p>
