<p>Possibly this is not a book that I should review. Having published a scholarly work on the War of 1812, I am aware of the difficulties of judging events and causes in that complex period. As a result, I am uneasy with both the content and the tone of Linklater’s study. He presents the assassination of the Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval, the hero of the Evangelicals, by Henry Bellingham on 11 May 1812 in the lobby of the House of Commons as a key event that sits at the fulcrum of major developments. Linked to this, Linklater catches ‘the threads of conspiracy’, with Bellingham assured of financial assistance. Thus we have passages such as ‘Spencer Perceval’s central position in the grand sweep of events – the war with Napoleon, the fight against the slave trade, the arrival of industrialism and the emergence of a trading pattern driven by market forces – explained why he had to die’ (p. 198).</p>
<p>I am far less convinced about the need to link everything up, and do not feel that the case is made. Bellingham’s plight was connected to the economic crisis, and the state of both trade and the war was important. Linklater draws attention to the major problems facing Liverpool trade, many due to government policy, and suggests a link: ‘No doubt in Liverpool’s salty fashion, loud voices declared that killing Spencer Perceval would be for the good of the country … Whether he heard it casually, or someone deliberately suggested it to him, the idea remained firmly in Bellingham’s mind’ (p. 194). Maybe so − the kindest verdict on the book.</p>
<p>Linklater’s study also raises questions about a currently fashionable method of popular writing history which is to take an episode or individual or substance (the turn will come for camomile tea), and treat it as one of crucial importance. This Stockholm Syndrome approach to history is commercially attractive for publishers and psychologically so for authors, but it raises serious issues. There are only so many turning-points in history, and only so many key individuals. There is also the problem presented by the method and tone that tend to be used. For example, ‘Holding baby Henry in his arms that winter may well have been the trigger that prompted John Bellingham to think once more of the riches he had lost in Archangel, and the injustice of being denied compensation’ (p. 183). Again, maybe so. The author’s approach is scarcely conducive to scholarly review.</p>
