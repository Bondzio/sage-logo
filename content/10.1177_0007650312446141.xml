<p><italic>Business &amp; Society</italic> (<italic>BAS</italic>) appears quarterly in March, June, September, and December. Volume 50, 2011, was the special anniversary celebration of the journal. Some commissioned items will continue to appear during 2012. Volume 51, 2012, will otherwise return to publication of regularly accepted articles and guest-edited special issues.</p>
<p>This journal began publication in September 1960, founded at Roosevelt University. As of December 2009, <italic>BAS</italic> was added to the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI)<sup>®</sup>. The inaugural 2-year impact factor for 2008-2010 was reported as 1.22 (Journal of Citation Reports/SSCI). A greatly enlarged, globally representative editorial board supports the journal. About a dozen associate editors are presently at work, specializing by key areas of business and society scholarship. The editor expresses appreciation here for the collective efforts of all associate editors, editorial board members, reviewers, and authors.</p>
<p>All new regular manuscript submissions to <italic>BAS</italic> should go directly to its online website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bas">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bas</ext-link>. Proposals and other communications concerning this journal should go to the editor, Professor Duane Windsor, at <email>odw@rice.edu</email>.</p>
<p><italic>BAS</italic> seeks submissions that will make strong theoretical and/or empirical contributions to the various fields falling within or overlapping with the broad rubric of business and society studies. We also consider commentary material and research notes addressing important topics within that rubric. The journal publishes occasional book reviews and dissertation abstracts. The editor is particularly interested in receiving theory building and conceptual work that will help to advance our understanding of business and society.</p>
<p>Subscribers have access at the journal website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bas.sagepub.com">http://bas.sagepub.com</ext-link>) to copyedited pdf versions of forthcoming articles through the Online First feature for electronic prepublication. Online First provides for electronic access (to subscribers) while articles are waiting for a physical publication slot. Subscribers have access at the journal website to an online archive of all published articles.</p>
<p>The International Association for Business and Society (IABS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iabs.net">http://iabs.net</ext-link>) is the official sponsor of this journal, which is published by SAGE Publications. The IABS website maintains a link to the journal home page. The expanded editorial board, including the associate editors, now tries to meet twice annually at the IABS meeting and the Academy of Management meeting. Individuals interested in serving as reviewers for <italic>BAS</italic> should contact the editor. The journal is operating through a set of associate editors, who are prominent scholars in their areas of expertise. Submitted papers are assessed as soon as possible by the editor upon receipt. If a submission warrants additional assessment, it is then forwarded to an associate editor to determine if external review should be undertaken. (The editor undertakes the reviewing of some submissions, as well.) Speed of reviewing depends in part, of course, on availability of qualified reviewers by time of year.</p>
<p>Several special issue calls are presently active. We keep such special issue calls posted at the <italic>BAS</italic> website and the IABS website (see Research). <italic>BAS</italic> is supporting a variety of paper-development initiatives in several of the fields within the discipline of business and society. Scholars interested in discussing future special issues are encouraged to contact the editor for an assessment. Generally, <italic>BAS</italic> has been encouraging conferences or workshops with coherent themes at which papers can be discussed. Calls are typically open to submitters independently of whether they present at such a conference or workshop.</p>
