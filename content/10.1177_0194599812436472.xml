<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To characterize the changes in the anteroposterior dimensions of both the retropalatal and retrolingual airway spaces of the pharynx and hyoid bone position during hypoglossal nerve stimulation under general anesthesia in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea.</p>
<p><italic>Study Design</italic>. Cross-sectional.</p>
<p><italic>Setting</italic>. Academic center.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. Cross-table fluoroscopic images obtained during hypoglossal nerve stimulation were studied in 26 subjects enrolled in the Apnex Medical Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation (HGNS) system feasibility trials. Changes in the anteroposterior dimensions (2-dimensional) of the retropalatal and retrolingual airway spaces and hyoid bone position were recorded. Measurements were estimated in millimeters and standardized to each subject’s C3 vertebral height. Opening of the pharyngeal airspace was examined relative to body mass index.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. During hypoglossal nerve stimulation, all subjects demonstrated anterior displacement of the tongue base on fluoroscopy. The average retrolingual airway opening was 0.71 ± 0.23 C3 vertebral body heights (9 ± 3 mm). Opening of the retropalatal airway with stimulation occurred in 65% (15/23) of subjects. When present, the average opening was 0.42 ± 0.14 vertebral heights (5 ± 3 mm). Anterior displacement of the hyoid occurred in 92% (23/25) of subjects. Retrolingual airway opening was independent of baseline body mass index.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion</italic>. Unilateral hypoglossal nerve stimulation results in anterior tongue base displacement and an increase in the anterior-posterior retrolingual airway dimensions of the pharynx, independent of body mass index. Opening of the retropalatal airway occurred in a majority of subjects and had a trend toward correlation with body mass index.</p>

<body>
<p>The pharynx is the primary source of upper airway obstruction in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A number of factors contribute to pharyngeal collapse in OSA, including the generation of negative pressure, anatomic narrowing, and the presence of enlarged soft tissues that surround the upper airway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812436472">1</xref></sup> During wakefulness, upper airway dilator muscles, especially the genioglossus, maintain pharyngeal stability and prevent pharyngeal collapse, and airway dilator muscle tone is increased in individuals with OSA during wakefulness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812436472">2</xref></sup> With the onset of sleep, the phasic activity of the genioglossus muscle and its response to negative pharyngeal pressure are reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812436472">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812436472">3</xref></sup> The loss of pharyngeal muscle dilator activity can lead to a greater potential for airway collapse and the development of upper airway obstruction during sleep.</p>
<p>The primary role of the genioglossus muscle in protecting against pharyngeal airway collapse has led to investigation of electrical stimulation of the genioglossus muscle, through intramuscular or transcutaneous electrodes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812436472">4</xref></sup> or of the hypoglossal nerve (HGN).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812436472">5</xref></sup> Short-term genioglossus stimulation during sleep has demonstrated improvements in airflow associated with observations of tongue protrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812436472">6</xref></sup> and endoscopically visualized enlargement of the pharynx with anterior motion of the tongue base.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812436472">7</xref></sup> Chronic stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve was safely performed in the canine model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812436472">8</xref></sup> A previous experience with HGN stimulation using a different implanted device produced improvements in OSA severity (apnea-hypopnea index), but there were no specific evaluation of changes in pharyngeal anatomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812436472">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Apnex Medical Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation (HGNS) system has been developed to deliver HGN stimulation for the treatment of OSA. It was found to have a favorable safety profile and resulted in a significant decrease in OSA severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812436472">10</xref></sup> The objective of this study is to characterize the changes in both the anteroposterior dimensions of the retropalatal and retrolingual airway spaces of the pharynx and hyoid bone position during unilateral HGN stimulation under general anesthesia in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599812436472" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>All subjects were enrolled in clinical studies of the HGNS System to Treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea. These studies were conducted at 4 centers in Australia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812436472">10</xref></sup> and the United States, respectively, and were approved by the ethics committees/institutional review boards of the respective institutions. All subjects provided informed written consent. Subject inclusion criteria for these studies included a previous diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA, a poor tolerance of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), aged between 21 and 70 years, and a body mass index (BMI) ≤40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Subjects were required to have an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) between 20 and 100/h, with at least 15/h occurring in non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812436472">11</xref></sup> Subjects were excluded if they had prior surgery of the oral cavity, a significant upper airway–related anatomic anomaly, or significant medical illness.</p>
<p>A neurostimulator and respiration sensing and stimulation leads were surgically implanted under general anesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812436472"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The stimulation electrode cuff was placed on a portion of the right hypoglossal nerve. Desired placement of the stimulation cuff was confirmed intraoperatively by performing cross-table cinefluoroscopy of the pharyngeal region, with the subject’s head in the neutral position and the inferior border of each mandibular body aligned. Stimulation electrode placement was accepted as correct if electrical stimulation demonstrated adequate anterior displacement of the tongue base and pharyngeal opening; without these findings, the stimulation cuff was repositioned for a repeat series of electrical stimulation. Cinefluoroscopy image acquisition was started and stopped approximately 1 second before and 1 second after, respectively, a set of 3 electrical stimulations delivered to the hypoglossal nerve. Each stimulation was 2 seconds long and consisted of 90-µs pulses at 40 Hz. The amplitude of stimulation was gradually increased in a stepwise manner from 0.4 milliamps (mA) to 1.4 mA, stopping if adequate tongue displacement was seen at an amplitude less than 1.4 mA. Once appropriate cuff position was accomplished, the stimulation lead body was tunneled deep to the platysma from the neck to the neurostimulator, which was implanted in an infraclavicular subcutaneous pocket on the right side. From the neurostimulator pocket, 2 respiratory sensing leads were implanted bilaterally along the costal margins and connected to the neurostimulator by a subcutaneously tunneled lead body.</p>

<title>Airway Measurements</title>
<p>Still images of the upper airway were acquired from the cinefluoroscopy videos before and during electrical stimulation bursts. An image pixel-counting software (Photoshop, Adobe Systems, Inc, San Jose, California) was used to quantify specific measurements from the fluoroscopic images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812436472"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Lines corresponding to the inferior and superior border of the mandibular body were drawn and extended posteriorly to the posterior pharyngeal wall at approximately the level of the tongue base and oropharynx, respectively. The following measurements were made: (1) vertical height of the third cervical vertebral body at its midportion (C3H); (2) length of the stimulating cuff electrode configuration, known to be 6 mm long; (3) anteroposterior length of the pharyngeal lucency at the level of the inferior border of the mandibular body (PLIMB); and (4) anteroposterior length of the pharyngeal lucency at the level of the superior border of the mandibular body (PLSMB). The PLSMB was divided into (a) the distance from the posterior border of the tongue base to the anterior border of the soft palate (PLSMB-Pre-Pal); (b) the distance from the posterior border of the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall (PLSMB-Post-Pal), defined as 0 if there was no lucency posterior to the palatal shadow; and (c) combined width of PLSMB-Pre-Pal and PLSMB-Post-Pal (PLSMB-Tot). All measurements were measured in pixel diameters by a single individual blinded to the subject’s BMI. C3H (measurement 1) and stimulating cuff electrode configuration length (measurement 2) were used to standardize measurements of PLIMB and PLSMB, including its components (measurements 3 and 4).</p>

<p>Palatal response was examined before and during stimulation to assess for the presence of anterior displacement and thinning of the soft palate. The magnitude of palatal motion was quantified by 2 independent observers blinded to the BMI as being less than or greater than the length of the stimulating cuff electrode configuration (6 mm). Anterior displacement was classified as minor if anterior motion was 6 mm or less and major if greater than 6 mm. Palatal thinning was classified as minor if the thickness of the palatal shadow decreased 6 mm or less and major if the decrease was greater than 6 mm. The data are presented as the average assessment between the 2 observers.</p>
<p>Hyoid movement associated with HGN stimulation was characterized by direction and magnitude by 2 independent observers blinded to the BMI. Direction of motion was classified according to a rostral-caudal circle, with 0 degrees being rostral and parallel to the spinal column axis, 90 degrees being anterior and perpendicular to the spinal column axis, 180 degrees being caudal and parallel to the spinal column axis, and 270 degrees being posterior and perpendicular to the spinal column axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812436472"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). Direction of motion was classified to the nearest 22.5 degrees. Magnitude of motion was estimated by comparing the linear displacement to the width of the hyoid bone, classified as 0 (no detectable motion associated with HGN stimulation), 0.25 (one-fourth of the width of the hyoid body or minimal motion), 0.5 (half the width of the body), or 1 (full width of the hyoid body or greater).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Digital video fluoroscopy confirms that anterior displacement of the tongue base and opening of the pharynx occurs with unilateral HGN stimulation during general anesthesia. In the absence of electrical HGN stimulation, the pharynx was closed at the level of the hypopharynx and oropharynx in all subjects. This adds to the previous finding of anterior tongue protrusion seen on direct visualization of the anterior tongue with unilateral HGN stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812436472">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a majority of subjects, unilateral HGN stimulation resulted in the appearance of a retropalatal space lucency (PLSMB-Post-Pal). The presence of a PLSMB-Post-Pal increased the amount of total airway (PLSMB-Tot) available as well as provided a nasal alternative to the oral airway associated with anterior displacement of the tongue base. The effect of hypoglossal nerve stimulation at the level of the hypopharynx and velopharynx in some subjects is consistent with the concept of multilevel treatment for sleep apnea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812436472">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Opening of the velopharynx has been demonstrated with voluntary tongue protrusion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812436472">13</xref></sup> acute mandibular advancement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812436472">14</xref></sup> and electrical stimulation of the genioglossus muscle using fine wire electrodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812436472">7</xref></sup> Retropalatal opening implies a connection between anterior tongue movement and palatal position in some subjects. The mechanism of palatal movement is likely a direct mechanical one. The palatoglossal fold and the contained palatoglossal muscle has been suggested as a likely conduit of the mechanical connection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812436472">14</xref></sup> Another mechanism by which anterior displacement of the tongue would interact with the pharynx is by a connection between the fibers of the superior pharyngeal constrictor and the base of the tongue. This can occur via a connection between the posterior part of the transverse lingual musculature and the superior pharyngeal constrictor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812436472">15</xref></sup> A glossopharyngeal portion of the superior pharyngeal constrictor, which originates from the root of the tongue along with the palatoglossus and styloglossus muscles, has been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812436472">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unilateral HGN stimulation produced anterior displacement of the hyoid bone in most subjects. An asymmetric elevation of the greater horn of the hyoid was avoided by excluding the branches to the hyoglossus muscle from stimulation. The hyoid bone has multiple soft tissue attachments to other structures related to the pharynx and has been targeted for treatment of OSA in various procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812436472">17</xref></sup> The average direction of hyoid movement was in a direction slightly inferior to a pure anterior displacement, but a wide range of responses occurred with HGN stimulation. The primary pull of the genioglossus would be expected to push the hyoid anteriorly and inferiorly as the bulk of the tongue is pulled forward over the top of the hyoid. The contribution of additional muscles acting on the hyoid would be expected to add different vectors of force. The hypoglossal nerve is polyfascicular within the digastric triangle and beyond.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812436472">18</xref></sup> The average number of fascicles in this region ranges from 1 to 5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812436472">19</xref></sup> The branching pattern is variable, with the most consistent branch containing cervical spinal fibers to the geniohyoid and thyrohyoid muscles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812436472">19</xref></sup> Variations in branching from the HGN can cause the actions of the thyrohyoid and geniohyoid muscles on the hyoid to differ with stimulation despite attempts to have consistent placement of the stimulating cuff.</p>
<p>C3 vertebral height was chosen as a reference for standardizing the magnitude of pharyngeal lucency seen on the radiographs. In a previous study of 141 cervical radiographs of healthy males, the average vertebral body height of C3 was 14.3 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812436472">20</xref></sup> Neither males nor females had a consistent trend for vertebral body height in relation to the total height of the individual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812436472">21</xref></sup> Frobin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812436472">22</xref></sup> found the average height of the C3 vertebrae to be roughly equivalent in males (9.1 ± 0.9 mm) and females (9.4 ± 1.1mm), but this is not a universal finding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812436472">21</xref></sup> The relative consistency of the C3 vertebral height was an advantage of this landmark. Additional benefits of using C3 as a landmark were its midline position and location adjacent to the area of interest. Because of likely variability in C3 height among subjects, summary measurements based on C3 height should be considered approximations. The stimulating electrode was chosen as a reference for estimating the dimensions of the pharyngeal lucency measures in millimeters due to its known size. Disadvantages of using the electrode cuff for standardizing measurements include observed changes in angle of the stimulating electrode from the sagittal plane and a position away from the midline of the pharynx.</p>
<p>Hypoglossal nerve stimulation was able to open the airway at the level of hypopharynx and oropharynx in all subjects examined. Previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812436472">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812436472">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812436472">24</xref></sup> have demonstrated an improved airflow with anterior displacement of the tongue base that increases in relation to the amount of displacement. Additional factors such as obesity, male gender, and age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599812436472">25</xref></sup> also play a role and may interfere with the ability to open the airway based on tongue movement alone. Analysis of the relationship between pharyngeal opening and the initial BMI was performed as obesity is a major risk factor for sleep apnea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599812436472">26</xref></sup> and was associated with the outcome in the Australian cohort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812436472">10</xref></sup> The ability of HGN stimulation to produce pharyngeal opening in the retrolingual area and anterior to the palate was not affected by BMI. The ability of HGNS to produce a retropalatal airspace trended toward correlation with the BMI.</p>
<p>This study has limitations. General anesthesia differs markedly from natural sleep, particularly in the greater collapse of the upper airway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599812436472">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0194599812436472">28</xref></sup> and the presence of an endotracheal tube in the former condition. Thus, the pharyngeal changes visualized under general anesthesia likely underestimate the changes that might occur during natural sleep, even though steps, including placement of the endotracheal tube to the left of the tongue base, were taken to enable the most accurate representation of changes seen with unilateral HGN stimulation. Further differences from actual therapeutic use of HGN stimulation might occur due to the lack of coordination of stimulation with respiration in the current study. Sample size was determined based on the assessment of safety and feasibility rather than the examination of these study outcomes. The lack of statistical significance for some results may be related to this sample size.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Examination of fluoroscopic videos of unilateral hypoglossal nerve stimulation with an implanted device demonstrated findings consistent with anterior displacement of the base of the tongue and an increase in the anterior-posterior retrolingual airway dimensions of the pharynx. In a majority of subjects examined, hypoglossal nerve stimulation resulted in opening of the retropalatal space. Hypoglossal nerve stimulation produced pharyngeal opening in the retrolingual area and anterior to the palate independent of BMI. The ability of HGNS to produce a retropalatal airspace, however, had a trend toward correlation with BMI.</p>
