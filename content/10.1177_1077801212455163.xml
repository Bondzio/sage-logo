<abstract>
<p>To fill an existing gap in research and practice on intimate partner violence (IPV) in immigrant communities, the authors developed an IPV prevention program, called the Shanti Project, in an Asian Indian community in the Midwest. Building on the notion of <italic>shanti</italic> (harmony/peace), a cherished value and strength of the community, we created a communications campaign that combined social marketing and community-based participatory approaches. Recognizing the interactive influences of multiple levels of social ecology, campaign activities were designed to bring about changes at the individual, relationship/family, organization, and community levels. This article presents the development of this theoretically, empirically, and community-based IPV prevention program.</p>

<body>
<p>Despite an increasing emphasis on the need for prevention of intimate partner violence (IPV) in diverse population groups, few programs in the United States have been tailored to specific racial and ethnic communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212455163">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2004</xref>). Prevention programs in immigrant communities in the United States are even fewer in number. In addition, empirical evaluation of IPV prevention programs is limited. The majority of those that have been rigorously evaluated are not community-based programs; they tend to be school-based prevention programs for children and youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077801212455163">Whitaker &amp; Reese, 2007</xref>). In addition, existing prevention programs tend to focus on effecting individual-level change rather than promoting change at other levels of the human ecology (e.g., family, organization, and community). In an effort to fill these gaps in IPV prevention, we set out to develop a theoretically and empirically based universal IPV prevention program, called the Shanti Project, in a local Asian Indian community in the Midwest. This article presents the processes used to develop the project and discusses strategies used to meet the challenges we faced.</p>
<p>The Shanti Project built on our ongoing community organizing efforts across multiple Asian communities that are diverse in ethnicity, language, and religion/faith, through a community–university partnership called New Visions. New Visions is aimed at creating and supporting community-generated IPV prevention strategies in local Asian communities. Incorporating the lessons learned from working in multiple Asian communities through New Visions, the Shanti Project represents our pilot effort to identify, implement, and evaluate socioculturally relevant strategies for IPV prevention in a specific ethnic community rather than a broad Asian group. We chose to focus on the Gujarati community, one of the largest Asian/Indian population groups in the area.</p>
<p>Building on the notion of <italic>shanti</italic> (harmony and peace), a cherished value and strength of the Gujarati community, the Shanti Project aims to create new community norms that denounce IPV, promote more egalitarian attitudes and behavior in interpersonal relationships, and encourage bystanders to confront abusive behavior. Combining social marketing approaches and participatory methods, we designed a communications campaign that utilized mass media to disseminate key messages along with local community-based activities to promote awareness and skill building among community members and community organizations.</p>

<title>Target Population: Indian/Gujarati Community</title>
<p>The Asian population is the fastest growing minority group in the United States, comprised of more than 24 ethnic groups with different migratory and historical experiences and varied languages, religions, and socioeconomic statuses. Asian Indians represent the second largest Asian group in the United States (after the Chinese); nationwide, there are more than 2,660,000 individuals who identify themselves as Asian Indians, representing about 18% of the Asians in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212455163">U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 2006-2008</xref>). In the project’s target area, a major urban area of a Midwestern state, Indians are the largest Asian group, totaling more than 61,900 and making up 1% to 2% of the general population in each of the area’s four counties; more than 70% were born outside the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212455163">U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 2006-2008</xref>). Indians make up more than 18% of the Asian populations in the area, and as high as 29% to 30% in some of the counties. The number of Asian Indians in the target area increased by 83% between 1990 and 2000 and by 41% between 2000 and 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212455163">Metzger &amp; Booza, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212455163">U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 2006-2008</xref>). Despite the increasing population size, Asian Indians and other Asian groups are underrepresented in research on IPV.</p>
<p>Asian Indians are themselves diverse in language, culture, religion, and history. We chose to focus on the Gujarati community because it is one of the largest and most organized Asian Indian communities in the region, and some community leaders and members expressed interest in addressing IPV. The Gujarati community is one of the largest subgroups of the Asian Indian population residing in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212455163">Williams, 2004</xref>). Although no population data specify the total number of Gujaratis, more than 10% of the Asian Indians in the United States reported speaking Gujarati in the American Community Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212455163">Ruggles, Alexander, Genadek, Schroeder, &amp; Sobek, 2010</xref>). Considering additional individuals of Gujarati decent who do not speak Gujarati, 20% to 40% of Asian Indians in the United States are estimated to be of Gujarati descent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212455163">Williams, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Gujaratis, who come from the western region of India, have their own sociocultural norms and language (Gujarati) and practice a variety of religions, including Hinduism, Jainism, Christianity, and Islam. The Gujarati community is often regarded by other Indian groups as a “pioneer” in activism and socioeconomic success. Gujaratis in the United States have attained substantial professional and socioeconomic success; many hold professional and/or managerial positions (e.g., physicians, engineers, corporate executives) or own businesses, most notably hotels and motels. More than 40% of hotels and motels in the United States are estimated to be owned by Gujaratis, holding a combined worth of US$40 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212455163">Dholakia-Dave, 2006</xref>). Gujaratis are well represented in various Indian professional and community-based organizations, such as the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, and Asian Indian Women’s Association. Thus, initiating an IPV prevention effort in this community not only recognized its leadership position among Asian Indians, it was also strategic in paving the way for future work with additional Indian or other interested communities. In addition, the Gujarati community has a tradition of valuing nonviolence, as practiced by fellow Gujarati, Mahatma Gandhi. For example, the Gujarati community celebrates Gandhi Jayanti on October 2nd, marking the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday by organizing events centering on the theme of nonviolence and peace. This value, we believed, would help ensure development of an IPV prevention program that was grounded in the community’s strengths, consistent with its values, and responsive to its sociocultural context.</p>

<title>IPV in Asian and Asian Indian Communities in the United States</title>
<p>Estimating the prevalence of IPV in the Gujarati community in the United States is challenging. In national or statewide population-based studies, the sampling frames or language barriers often exclude Asians, especially those with limited English proficiency. Even when Asians are included in a study, they are often excluded from analyses due to small samples or are lumped together either as “Others” or Asians or Asian/Pacific Islanders (without ethnic breakdown), as in the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212455163">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>), for example. Moreover, standardized instruments are not likely to capture specific sociocultural manifestations of IPV (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077801212455163">Yoshihama, 2001</xref> for possible bias resulting from the use of a standardized measure). Although studies that aggregate various Asian groups, such as the NVAWS, have found a significantly lower lifetime rate of physical/sexual IPV for the aggregated group of Asian/Pacific Islander women (15%) than for other groups of women (23% to 38%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212455163">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>), studies of specific Asian groups have found a wide range of lifetime prevalence of IPV (14% to 51.7%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212455163">Hicks, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212455163">Hurwitz, Gupta, Liu, Silverman, &amp; Raj, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212455163">Raj &amp; Silverman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077801212455163">Yick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077801212455163">Yoshihama, 1999</xref>). These findings suggest that the prevalence of IPV in Asian communities is not consistently lower than found in other population groups and may in fact be higher for some groups.</p>
<p>There have been several studies of Asian Indians using nonprobability samples and aggregated South Asian groups, which included individuals of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Bhutanese, Nepalese, and Sri Lankan descent. Two such studies reported a prevalence of IPV ranging from 21.2% to 40.8% among South Asian women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212455163">Hurwitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212455163">Raj &amp; Silverman, 2002</xref>). A study of six Asian groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212455163">Leung &amp; Cheung, 2008</xref>) reported separate prevalence rates of past-year IPV among Indian men and women (19.5%); however, it used a nonprobability sample and did not provide rates separately for women and men. This study elucidated considerable variation in IPV prevalence among various Asian groups, which ranged from 9.7% (Chinese and Japanese) to 22.4% (Vietnamese; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212455163">Leung &amp; Cheung, 2008</xref>). These findings clearly warn against using aggregation across ethnic groups and underscore the importance of studying specific ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Though IPV is a problem in all communities, certain sociocultural factors contribute to how IPV is manifested and how victims, perpetrators, family, and community members respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212455163">Dasgupta &amp; Warrier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212455163">Flores-Ortiz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1077801212455163">Yoshihama, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077801212455163">2002a</xref>). Studies of abused South Asian women have documented various manifestations of IPV that derive from hierarchical and patriarchal family structures and practices, such as parallel abuse by in-laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212455163">Ahmad, Riaz, Barata, &amp; Stewart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212455163">Mehrotra, 1999</xref>) and abuse related to conflicts over dowry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212455163">Stone &amp; James, 1995</xref>). IPV against women is often tolerated and even justified when women were viewed as not conforming to their expected gender roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077801212455163">Yoshihama, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077801212455163">Yoshioka, DiNoia, &amp; Ullah, 2001</xref>). Rigid gender norms have been found to be linked to high tolerance of IPV. For example, a recent study of South Asian women in Toronto, Canada, found that the more respondents adhered to patriarchal social norms, the less likely they were to consider a situation depicted in a vignette as IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212455163">Ahmad et al., 2004</xref>). Outside intervention is discouraged for fear that it will bring shame and dishonor to the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212455163">Abraham, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212455163">Dasgupta, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212455163">Dasgupta &amp; Jain, 2007</xref>). Thus, IPV remains hidden in Asian Indian communities. Moreover, status as a racial or ethnic minority and/or immigrant in the United States affects dynamics of IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212455163">Abraham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212455163">Dasgupta, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801212455163">Orloff &amp; Kaguyutan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077801212455163">Yoshihama &amp; Nakashima, 2006</xref>). Because of historical and contemporary discrimination targeted at Asians in the United States, community leaders fear that acknowledging the seriousness of IPV in their communities will invite additional stigma and disadvantage to an already marginalized community. Survival of the community is often considered the priority, and as a consequence, IPV remains unrecognized and unaddressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212455163">Dasgupta, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077801212455163">Yoshihama, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077801212455163">Yoshihama &amp; Nakashima, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although family and community structures and practices rooted in patriarchal ideology contribute to the tolerance of IPV, close family and community ties, as well as the value placed on collective welfare, could serve as sources of strength upon which prevention strategies can be built. Another potential strength that could be capitalized on for IPV prevention is a central role of community- and faith-based organizations in the lives of Gujaratis; as in other immigrant communities, many rely on these organizations for information and support in order to survive in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212455163">Bacon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212455163">Diwan &amp; Jonnalagadda, 2001</xref>). These organizations serve as loci of social networking, due largely to various events they sponsor throughout the year. Because of their visible and prominent positions, leaders in these organizations are regarded as information sources, advisers, and opinion leaders and, thus, are in the position to influence attitudes and norms of community members.</p>
<p>Considering this sociocultural context, we sought ways to create an IPV prevention program building on these strengths, including close family ties, community networks, and information channels such as community organizations and leaders. And guided by an ecological framework that stresses the importance of multiple systems’ impact on behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212455163">Abroms &amp; Maibach, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212455163">Maibach, Abroms, &amp; Marosits, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212455163">McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, &amp; Glanz, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212455163">Petraglia, Galavotti, Harford, Pappas-DeLuca, &amp; Mooki, 2007</xref>), we sought to create a prevention program to effect changes at various levels of the human ecology: individual, family and relationships (e.g., addressing the patriarchal gender roles), organizations (e.g., promoting the recognition of IPV as a community issue and increasing collective efficacy to address it among community- and faith-based organizations), and communities (e.g., promoting new norms).</p>

<title>Program Development</title>
<sec id="section4-1077801212455163">
<title>Theoretical Basis</title>
<p>In designing the project, we drew from feminist theory, social exchange theory, the theory of planned behavior, and social cognitive theory. Feminist theory posits that IPV is a manifestation of unequal power relationships between men and women that are created and sustained through social institutions, laws, and hegemonic and interpersonal practices. According to this view, IPV is supported by and simultaneously reinforces male dominance in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212455163">Bograd, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212455163">R. E. Dobash &amp; R. P. Dobash, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212455163">Miedzian, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212455163">Schechter, 1982</xref>). Feminist theory guided our conceptualization of IPV, especially its root causes. For example, our initial campaign activities emphasized that IPV is <italic>not</italic> caused by alcohol, stress, or anger and suggested that in order to prevent IPV, it is necessary to examine and make changes in the patriarchal ideology and social norms that support it. We also drew on feminist methods of participatory engagement and inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801212455163">Maguire, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077801212455163">Yoshihama &amp; Carr, 2002</xref>), such as collective decision making and explicit attention to the voices of individuals from marginalized groups.</p>
<p>According to social exchange theory, IPV occurs because the benefits of engaging in the behavior (e.g., control over partners) outweigh the costs (i.e., social sanctions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212455163">Bersani &amp; Chen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212455163">Gelles, 1983</xref>). Thus, prevention of IPV requires an increase in the actual or perceived benefits of nonviolence and/or in the repercussions of engaging in IPV. Accordingly, the Shanti Project sought to create new community norms that denounced IPV, highlighted the negative effects of IPV (e.g., lower achievement in children, family breakups), and emphasized the benefits of nonviolent alternatives (e.g., stronger families, a more prosperous community).</p>
<p>Whereas feminist theory and social exchange theory provided broad directions for the campaign, the theory of planned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212455163">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>) suggested the specific pathways through which IPV could be prevented. This theory posits that individuals’ intentions/decisions to engage in a particular behavior are determined by their beliefs about the behavior, perceptions about the norms related to that behavior, and perceived control over the behavior. Thus, in addition to changing individuals’ beliefs about IPV and nonviolence, changes in the perceived norms and/or the norms themselves are needed in order to bring about desired changes. Furthermore, individuals must feel that they have control over, or are otherwise capable of, making the change—a sense of efficacy. Thus, the Shanti Project strove to facilitate changing community norms around IPV and nonviolence and to promote a sense of efficacy through the campaign messages and activities. In addition, social cognitive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212455163">Bandura, 1986</xref>), especially social learning theory, guided the structure and content of prevention activities. Social cognitive theory posits that individuals learn about social behaviors by seeing them modeled and/or practicing them. It also recognizes the importance of self-efficacy in bringing about behavioral change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212455163">Bandura, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212455163">1986</xref>). This theoretical strand pointed to the importance of incorporating into the program ample opportunities for community members to both see new behaviors modeled and to practice them themselves.</p>
<p>Collectively, these theories led us to develop a multimethod communications campaign. The campaign messages and activities were designed to address patriarchal ideologies and practices, increase knowledge of IPV, strengthen skills and self-efficacy in taking action to prevent IPV, and change the perceived community norms around silence and inaction with respect to IPV. Furthermore, we created campaign messages with concrete suggestions regarding nonviolent alternatives to IPV and provided many opportunities for community members to practice these nonviolent skills at local events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077801212455163">
<title>Combining a Social Marketing Approach and Community Engagement</title>
<p>To develop a communications campaign, we turned to social marketing as an approach to strategically develop and disseminate IPV prevention messages and activities that facilitate behavior change. Social marketing is the application of commercial marketing techniques “to influence the voluntary behavior of target audience to improve their personal welfare and that of the society of which they are a part” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212455163">Andreasen, 1994</xref>, p. 110). As in commercial marketing, social marketing requires a strong understanding of the target audience’s knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors (KABBs) related to the desired behavior. Central components of marketing are often referred to as the “marketing mix” or 4 Ps: products, price, place, and promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212455163">McCarthy, 1971</xref>). The goal is to identify meaningful benefits of these behaviors (“products”) that outweigh competing behaviors or barriers to adopting the behavior (“price”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212455163">Andreasan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212455163">Kotler &amp; Zaltman, 1971</xref>). Increasing the perceived benefits and/or decreasing the costs of engaging in a desired behavior motivates the target audience to engage in that desired behavior, an orientation consistent with social exchange theory. This understanding assists campaign planners in determining where the project can expose target audiences to communication messages and tools that promote the desired behavior (“place”) and how the messages can most effectively be conveyed (“promotion”). Therefore, gaining a detailed understanding of the KABBs concerning IPV among the target audience was a critical and ongoing component in campaign development (see Linking Formative Research and Campaign Planning below). We worked with a social marketing agency to benefit from their expertise and technical assistance in a range of areas, including crafting campaign creative strategy, messages, and materials (e.g., posters, brochures, public service announcements [PSAs]), media planning and buy (e.g., purchasing radio air time), and public relations (e.g., media training).</p>
<p>One criticism of social marketing is that its top-down approach does not allow for meaningful community participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212455163">Schiavo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077801212455163">Waisbord, 2001</xref>). To address this limitation, the Shanti Project incorporated community engagement and participatory planning with social marketing approaches. This combined approach is similar to the community organization, system-change approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212455163">Yonas et al., 2007</xref>) and the community-based prevention marketing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212455163">Bryant et al., 2007</xref>). Participatory methods are effective for strengthening community ownership and reach, and ongoing input and feedback from community stakeholders are necessary for developing socioculturally relevant and sustainable program strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212455163">Israel, Eng, Schultz, &amp; Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212455163">Minkler, 2005</xref>). At the same time, challenges abound in ensuring sustainable participation of lay community residents, especially in immigrant and refugee communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212455163">Krieger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212455163">Minkler, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212455163">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077801212455163">Yoshihama &amp; Carr, 2002</xref>). The Shanti Project involved the target audience and other stakeholders in various stages of the project, including campaign development and implementation.</p>
<p>To ensure ongoing community input and feedback, we assembled and worked with a Community Action Team (CAT) of community members. To recruit CAT members diverse in age, immigration status, and educational level, we used various methods, including web announcements, referrals by community leaders, and snowball sampling from interested community members. CAT members participated in an initial training of over 40 hours that covered a range of topics central to the project: dynamics and root causes of IPV, prevention theories and approaches, community engagement and organizing, social marketing, and evaluation methods. Following the initial intensive training, CAT members played a central role in the development and implementation of the campaign. All CAT members received a small monthly stipend for their ongoing participation.</p>
<p>We also obtained community feedback through the concept testing to further strengthen the sociocultural effectiveness of the campaign (see Concept Development and Testing for details). Community ownership and reach was facilitated through ongoing collaboration with community- and faith-based organizations that began in the grant proposal submission phase and continued into the program development and implementation phases. Initially, only a few organizations expressed interest in working with the Shanti Project. Over time, the number grew to almost a dozen, including civic, cultural, religious, and business organizations. These organizations have collaborated by disseminating the campaign messages and event information via their newsletters and websites, cosponsoring prevention activities, and inviting the Shanti Project to their events, among other things.</p>

<title>Linking Formative Research and Campaign Planning</title>
<p>We conducted formative research using multiple methods to assess the target population’s KABBs regarding IPV and to identify factors that might facilitate or impede behavior change. A total of 222 individuals (ranging in age from 17 to 70 or above), approximately equal numbers of men and women, participated in focus groups, individual interviews, and written or web surveys. Focus groups and individual interviews examined respondents’ perceptions about definitions, prevalence, and causes of IPV, existing resources in the community, perceived barriers to seeking help, and suggested strategies for preventing IPV. Paper-and-pencil and web surveys covered many of the same domains and also asked about sources of information used by respondents (e.g., newspaper, television, radio). We recruited focus group participants and individual interviews through snowball sampling and through in-person recruitment at local community events with high Gujarati attendance. We also posted a link to the web survey on websites known to be frequented by Gujaratis and also sent out the link via email announcement over various Gujarati/Indian/South Asian listservs. Given the scarcity of empirical data on IPV in Asian or Asian Indian populations, the formative research was essential in understanding the target community and shaping the development of IPV prevention strategies.</p>
<p>Project staff and CAT members (the project team, hereinafter) worked together to analyze and interpret formative research data. The findings from the surveys illustrated how IPV is viewed in the community. For example, the majority of the respondents agreed that IPV “occurs in the Gujarati community” (76%) and “is hurting the strength of the Gujarati community” (66%). Although the majority (83.4%) agreed that “Gujaratis are a nonviolent community,” the respondents’ view on the community members’ response to IPV indicated lenient attitudes toward use of violence in intimate relationships: Only 18% indicated that people in the Gujarati community confront people who are abusive to their partners. Only 30% agreed with the statement, “Most people in the Gujarati community are concerned about IPV.” Yet a far larger proportion (74%) agreed that people in the Gujarati community gossip about people who have experienced IPV.</p>
<p>In addition, the analysis of the interviews uncovered several ways in which IPV was characterized by members of the target community and suggested directions for the campaign. Broadly, the following five themes emerged that informed and influenced the campaign development: (a) limited scope of what is considered IPV, (b) norms of privacy and the practice of gossiping around the issue of IPV, (c) the importance of family well-being, (d) the link between the patriarchal norms and justification of IPV, and (e) a notion that respect is not an entitlement. Community members recognized physical violence as IPV; however, they sometimes considered more subtle forms, such as verbal and emotional abuse, as acceptable. Cultural norms of family privacy inhibited talking about IPV openly. Most community members knew that IPV occurred in their community; however, many of them only talked about it by gossiping with others who were not directly involved. In contrast to frequent gossiping, providing assistance to the victim, intervening, or confronting the perpetrator was rare. It was more acceptable to talk about the negative effect of IPV on children than on women and men. The success and health of families, especially children, emerged as key priorities for many community members, suggesting that framing IPV as a major threat to family well-being might help lessen resistance to addressing IPV. Another theme was that notions of power, control, and respect were tied together and supported by hierarchical family and community relationships. Men were considered to be the “heads” of the family, deserving of respect from other members, such as women and children. Women were seen as being in charge of the children and also deserving of respect from them. If powerful family members did not feel that they were being given respect, they felt entitled to use violence, power, and control to get it. Notably, formative research participants felt that respect ought not be obligatory by those in lower-status positions toward those in positions of power; rather, they described respect as a process that occurred within bidirectional relationships. They indicated that respect is not an entitlement and referred to the need for earning respect, as illustrated in the following remarks: “respect must be earned” and “don’t expect to be respected unless you treat others with respect.”</p>
<p>The results of the formative research indicated that preferred methods of community education take such forms as seminars or talks at community venues; PSAs on television, radio, and in print publications; community newsletter and website articles; and distribution of brochures at community events. Formative research also helped identify communication channels that were frequently used and trusted among community members. In addition to radio, newspaper, and community newsletters, judging from the large number of completed web surveys (<italic>n</italic> = 165), the Internet was found to be a viable communication channel to use in the campaign. An additional communication channel was community leaders and organizations; formative research participants emphasized the need to work with leaders and active members of community-based organizations to increase their recognition of IPV as an issue impacting the entire community. In addition to ongoing discussions with CAT members, we consulted with individuals and organizations that had expressed interest in the project and volunteered their time to provide feedback, which further helped to clarify and synthesize information gained through the formative research.</p>

<sec id="section7-1077801212455163">
<title>Campaign Development: Audience, Objectives, and Strategies</title>
<p>Guided by the findings from the formative research and theories of IPV and behavior change, the project team worked with a social marketing agency to determine target audience, campaign objectives, and strategies for meeting those objectives. Although there were initial discussions of segmenting the target audience by immigration/generational status, gender, or age, the project team ultimately chose Gujarati families as the primary target audience for the campaign—specifically family members older than 16 years, regardless of gender, age, religion, marital status, and years of residence in the United States. This decision reflected the prominent position of the family as a social unit within Gujarati culture. Furthermore, the project team did not want to single out any subgroups of the community, which might lead to unwarranted blame for the problem of IPV or responsibility for addressing it on selected subgroups. Community members with influence within the Gujarati community (formal and informal community leaders) were considered a secondary audience and were expected to influence the behaviors of the primary audience. With the overall goal of promoting nonviolence and strengthening Gujarati families and community, the initial campaign objectives were the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1077801212455163" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Raise awareness about IPV; for example, it is not limited to physical violence, it affects everyone in the family and community, and it is tied to the notions of power, control, and respect;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Raise awareness of the benefits of open communication and mutual respect;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increase self-efficacy in communicating within one’s own family and in intervening when witnessing abusive or violent incidents;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increase community leaders’ self-efficacy in addressing IPV;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increase community organizations’ collective sense of responsibility for supporting and educating families in maintaining healthy relationships.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The project team and the social marketing agency subsequently drafted creative briefs (also known as design or communication briefs). These documents connected campaign objectives and creative strategies, such as desired tone of the campaign, media choices, and other creative considerations (e.g., color preferences and colors to avoid, imagery, and visual themes).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077801212455163">
<title>Concept Development and Testing</title>
<p>Based on the creative briefs, the social marketing agency drafted six campaign concepts to explore different ways of packaging and delivering the campaign’s main messages. Each concept featured a headline, tagline, logo, “key visual,” and creative strategy in a poster format. The project team chose four of these concepts to test in focus groups comprised of community members and leaders: “role models—what are we teaching our children,” “redefining <italic>shanti</italic> (peace/harmony) to include a peaceful home,” “IPV is a universal problem,” and “next generation—pass down the peaceful tradition.”</p>
<p>Of the four concepts tested, the one that resonated most with the target audience was “role models.” This concept depicted verbal abuse between parents while a child watched in the background, underscoring the importance of providing positive role models for children and demonstrating how children can easily become the “unintended victims” of IPV. This concept was operationalized in two ways in the campaign: (a) depicting the negative effect on children who witness abusive or nonhealthy interaction between their parents, and (b) parents and adults modeling positive and respectful behavior for their children. Because it did not focus directly and/or solely on physical violence and negative consequences of IPV, the project team believed that this concept would encourage community discussion of IPV and help expand the narrowly constructed view of IPV to include nonphysical violence.</p>
<p>Another concept tested was redefining <italic>shanti</italic> (peace/harmony), designed to encourage reexamination and reaffirmation of the Gujarati tradition of nonviolence while also increasing project name recall. The participants indicated that use of the term <italic>shanti</italic> was somewhat confusing when not framed within the context of religion. However, the tagline tested as part of the <italic>shanti</italic> concept—“How peaceful is your home?”—resonated well with the concept test participants, pushing them to reflect on the current emotional environments in their homes and to think about taking steps to make them more peaceful. Therefore, this tagline was integrated into the campaign materials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077801212455163">
<title>Communications Plan, Campaign Materials, and Local Events</title>
<p>Incorporating the results from the concept testing, the project team and the social marketing agency finalized a communications plan that outlined the objectives, strategies, and key messages described above and identified types of campaign activities to accomplish the campaign objectives. In addition, using the above-described concept and tagline, we created multimedia campaign materials, including posters, brochures, and printed PSAs. These print materials were pretested using focus groups, individual interviews, and community intercept interviews, many of which were conducted by CAT members. We also sought feedback from community leaders and members who made themselves available as ad hoc consultants. Based on the pretest and community feedback, the materials were revised multiple times and subsequently translated into Gujarati using the back translation method. The materials were first introduced at a community-wide campaign launch event and were subsequently posted at local small businesses (e.g., ethnic grocery stores) and placed as advertisements in event programs, newsletters, and member directories of community- and faith-based organizations. As the formative research indicated that the Internet was an important information source, campaign materials were disseminated via the project website and through links on community portals, blogs, and community- and faith-based organizations’ websites. Although no local TV station or program targets the Indian or Gujarati community specifically, several locally produced radio programs serve as popular sources of information about community affairs and provide entertainment. Therefore, we ran announcements of upcoming events and activities, as well as PSAs, on these radio shows.</p>
<p>Although radio, the Internet, and publications of community-based organizations provided a wide reach, opportunities for the target audience to observe and/or practice new behaviors were also crucial to increasing the probability of desired behavioral changes. Thus, to reinforce media-based campaign messages, we developed and implemented local community-based events and activities (film and theatrical presentations, trainings, and member meetings) in which participants were encouraged to engage in interactive discussion of IPV and how to prevent it. The film presentations featured popular Bollywood movies and were held at a centrally located community center or a university campus. Along with community-based activities, we continued to reach out to and engage community- and faith-based organizations in the discussion on IPV prevention to effect changes at organizational levels.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Developing and implementing a theoretically, empirically, and community-based IPV universal prevention program is challenging, especially when working in an immigrant community. Among the challenges we faced were the paucity of empirical data on IPV, limited availability of data regarding the applicability of behavior change theories to the target population (because these theories have been developed based on, and applied to, primarily Western population groups), and difficulty translating certain Western concepts into the target language. During the course of our project development, we struggled for and strategized about ways to meet these challenges, often triangulating the theories, data, and community perspectives, as well as input and feedback—hence the title of this article, “Integrating Theories, Data, and Community.”</p>
<sec id="section11-1077801212455163">
<title>Theory, Data, and Community: Triangulation and Integration</title>
<p>Findings from the formative research were generally consistent with those of previous studies among Asians and Asian Indians—a narrow definition of IPV focusing on physical violence; denial of the problem despite community awareness of the occurrence of IPV; minimization of the frequency, prevalence, or impact of IPV; viewing IPV as a private or personal, rather than a community issue; and tolerance and/or justification of men’s use of violence against women to exert control within the patriarchal family context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212455163">Abraham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212455163">Dasgupta &amp; Warrier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077801212455163">Yoshihama, 2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077801212455163">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077801212455163">Yoshioka et al., 2001</xref>). However, the formative research helped identify several additional critical issues to be addressed in the campaign, such as the pervasiveness of gossip, a practice that hindered not only survivors’ help seeking but also community members’ candid dialogue about IPV. As we designed the campaign messages and activities to encourage community members to talk about IPV with family and friends, we were mindful about distinguishing between gossip and a discussion that promotes awareness among people in a social network. Not surprisingly, at various community-based activities, participants readily acknowledged the pervasive practice of gossiping; this acknowledgment often served as a point of initiating dialogue, not gossip, about IPV among event participants.</p>
<p>Another illustrative example of how triangulation of theory, data, and community participation guided the development of the campaign was crafting a socioculturally grounded campaign message using the concept of respect. Formative research participants indicated that notions of power, control, and respect were conventionally tied to the hierarchical and patriarchal family and community structures. At the same time, formative research respondents, CAT members, and other community members also pointed out that respect is not an entitlement of those in power (e.g., older males). Whereas feminist theories and empirical data on the association between patriarchal attitudes and IPV emphasized the need to challenge the patriarchal ideology and associated traditions and practices (e.g., rigid gender roles), our formative research and ongoing meetings with community leaders and members indicated that there was reluctance, and outright opposition in some cases, to address and change “traditions.” To avoid the risk of alienating the very audience we hoped to engage, we sought ways to challenge the patriarchal aspects of family relations and community practices while still maintaining traditions, focusing on the family unit, and contributing to the prosperity of the community. Listening to community members and leaders and working closely with CAT members, we began to see that the concept of <italic>respect</italic> could bridge the two seemingly different agendas. Respect could challenge patriarchal manifestations such as gendered role expectations and communication, while promoting stronger family relationships. This, in turn, would help maintain the self-ascribed and publically endorsed view of the Gujarati community as thriving and prosperous. Feminist theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212455163">Farley, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212455163">Roth, 2010</xref>) put forth the proposition that “everybody should be respected, regardless of gender (and other power-laden social positionalities, such as class, race, and immigration status).” Community members echoed, “respect must be earned” and “don’t expect to be respected unless you treat others with respect.” Building on the community members’ perspectives, the concept of respect served as a way to challenge patriarchal structure and practices within the family and community in a manner that was socioculturally more congruent and less threatening than more direct, often individually oriented, “Western” approaches that stress women’s agency and empowerment. Predicated on the notion that “mutual respect and open communication are foundations of peace (<italic>shanti</italic>),” our campaign began with the tagline, “How peaceful is your home?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077801212455163">
<title>Beyond Community Engagement and Organizing: Capacity Building</title>
<p>The need for ongoing community involvement in developing an effective IPV prevention campaign was made clear on many fronts: the lack of empirical data about IPV and limited data regarding the applicability of behavior change theories to the target population, the community’s denial of IPV and reluctance to address it, and the broad goal of changing community norms. In addition, although the Shanti Project staff had extensive experiences in community-based work in IPV or related areas, none belonged to the target community. Engaging cultural- and faith-based organizations as well as formal and informal community leaders was critical in building community support, since they play a central role as community gatekeepers. Community participation is even more critical when addressing “controversial” topics such as IPV, in which desired behavioral change may be perceived as challenging cherished traditions and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212455163">Minkler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077801212455163">Yoshihama &amp; Carr, 2002</xref>). Unlike programs promoting behavior that is generally considered to be for the common good—such as increasing exercise to promote better health—addressing taboo topics such as IPV requires garnering support for the project, cultivating allies, and establishing trust, and credibility in the eyes of, leaders and gatekeepers of the community.</p>
<p>As discussed previously, the Shanti Project incorporated philosophies and strategies of community engagement and organizing, theories of behavior change and health promotion, and social marketing approaches. This integrated model shares many principles similar to the community organization, system-change approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212455163">Yonas et al., 2007</xref>) and the community-based prevention marketing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212455163">Bryant et al., 2007</xref>). The above-mentioned example of using the notion of respect in the campaign to promote changes in patriarchal ideologies and practices illustrates the critical importance of community participation when developing a prevention program grounded in the target community’s perspectives. Had we not garnered the amount and kind of community input we had, our campaign messages might not have been socioculturally relevant or, worse, may have been offensive and alienating. One tangible benefit of ensuring community participation is, without doubt, increased sociocultural relevance of program activities.</p>
<p>Beyond increased sociocultural relevance, which directly benefits the practitioners and researchers, community engagement and organizing approaches can lead to sustainable capacity building among the participants and their community. By incorporating community engagement and organizing approaches, we sought long-term benefits to the community beyond its immediate benefit to the project. We hoped that their participation in the project would enable community members and organizations to continue some aspects of the project after funding ends and that their enhanced capacity could serve as a catalyst to address a broad range of issues confronting the community, such as racial justice and immigrant rights. Guided by this vision, we established the CAT and maintained ongoing collaboration with community- and faith-based organizations.</p>
<p>Although benefits are ample, many challenges accompany efforts to promote active, ongoing participation of members of the target community. These include the difficulty of recruiting diverse community members, questions of how to train and retain participants, and the creation of opportunities and mechanisms within the project that maximize participants’ involvement and impact within the constraints of a tight project timeline and limited resources. CAT members’ skills and interests varied considerably; not all were interested in or capable of all required tasks and activities. Extensive time and effort were required to train CAT members in unfamiliar tasks such as focus group facilitation, community intercept interviews, and public discussion facilitation. Member turnover due to changes in personal and professional commitments and constraints further challenged the maintenance of a necessary level of knowledge and skills. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077801212455163">Yoshihama and Carr (2002)</xref> who conducted participatory research with refugee women, we were repeatedly confronted by questions, including the following: Is more participation always better? How much input and decision making is desirable or ideal? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212455163">Krieger and colleagues (2002)</xref> point out that the amount of participation is just one dimension on a spectrum of participation and that more participation is not necessarily better. They argue that “partners in community-based research determine the degree and nature of participation that is best suited to the project at hand” (p. 374). Our experiences lead us to believe that what is critical is <italic>meaningful</italic> participation that strengthens the project and fosters the capacity of community members individually and as a group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077801212455163">
<title>Within-Group Diversity</title>
<p>A unique feature of our project is the focus on a single ethnic group as opposed to a broad, aggregated group, such as Asians or Indians. Yet even this narrower focus does not remedy the need for, and challenges of, attending to within-group diversity—a significant factor in this project. To address such challenges, we elicited participation of diverse community members in project planning, developed bilingual campaign materials, held events at various times and locations, and worked with multiple community- and faith-based organizations.</p>
<p>Among CAT members, both genders and a wide range of age groups were well represented; however, several other aspects of diversity were limited, despite our efforts to recruit individuals from diverse backgrounds. For example, those who were able to actively participate tended to be students, retired persons, or those between jobs. Community members who had regular employment and/or heavy dependent care responsibilities were underrepresented in CAT membership. Despite these limitations, the occupational or academic backgrounds and interests of CAT members ranged widely and included medicine, law, public health, engineering, computer technologies, communication, language and literature, theater, and women’s studies.</p>
<p>Among the target population, within-group diversity was manifested differently. We created most major print materials in both English and Gujarati, and Bollywood films were shown in Hindi with English subtitles. Despite these bilingual materials, other prevention activities were carried out primarily in English. Because English was the dominant language, our reach to those with limited English proficiency was likely very limited. Another challenge included reaching individuals of diverse faiths. Although the vast majority of Gujaratis in the United States are either Hindu or Jain, a small proportion is Muslim, Christian, or Buddhist. By holding prevention activities at community centers and university campuses, away from specific places of worship, we endeavored to reach out to people of all faiths. However, in the absence of special outreach to Gujaratis who practice Islam, Christianity, or Buddhism, the Shanti Project’s reach was predominantly to those of Hindu or Jain faith. Increasing reach to individuals with less represented backgrounds and incorporating their perspectives into project planning remains a major challenge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1077801212455163">
<title>Individual, Social Network, and Community</title>
<p>Focusing on the specific local community, the Shanti Project sought to shape the multiple levels of ecology that influence individuals’ attitudes and behavior. First, the campaign addressed factors at the individual level: increasing knowledge and beliefs about IPV (e.g., IPV is not only physical and is not caused by alcohol, stress, or anger), increasing motivation and intention to attend prevention activities, and ultimately encouraging the taking of action to prevent IPV. Second, the campaign incorporated messages and activities targeting change within social networks. Specifically, the campaign messages encouraged community members to talk about IPV with their families and friends; the film series, for example, enabled family and friends to participate together and discuss IPV. Third, by promoting the recognition of IPV as a community issue that warranted active community-wide involvement, the campaign also encouraged community leaders to talk about IPV in their organizations. At the community level, campaign messages aimed for high and wide reach through dissemination of print campaign materials at local ethnic grocery and video stores; weekly radio announcements; advertisements in ethnic, cultural, and religious organizations’ publications; and presence at various community events. A recent remark by the president of one of the largest community-based organizations—”You are everywhere”—attests to the Shanti Project’s visibility and presence in the target community. An increasing number of community- and faith-based organizations have approached us, expressing interest in receiving IPV prevention training. To ensure project sustainability, train-the-trainer sessions have been conducted with key individuals in organizations that have the potential and commitment to continue IPV prevention activities in their own organizations.</p>
<p>Developing the Shanti Project has been quite a journey for us. At times, we seemed to be trekking a road that few have traveled before. We had maps and guidebooks written by forerunners who had traveled before us; however, these were rather broken up by themes (e.g., behavior change theories, IPV prevention strategies, community engagement and organizing, or working with immigrants). We have cultivated, walked with, and worked alongside local guides (e.g., CAT members, community informants, and consultants) and used our own knowledge and experience to triangulate and integrate multiple sources of guidance—theories, data, and community participation.</p>
