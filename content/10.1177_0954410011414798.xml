<abstract>
<p>The needed shift in next generation aircraft design is expected to bring novel concepts for civil aviation as the jet-flap wing. The aircraft efficiency improvements with the jet-flap wing directs its use for future aircraft designs reinforced by the tendency for more synergistic systems as active flow control, boundary layer ingestion and distributed propulsion, making the jet-flap wing a very suitable option for the latter concept. The analysis carried out in this paper is aimed at the application of the jet-flap wing concept for manoeuvrability and cruise efficiency improvement of an airliner. A 2D computational model of a jet-flapped transonic airfoil is developed in order to assess the jet-flap wing technology for a commercial aircraft at cruise conditions. This paper provides an insight into the parameters that affect the performance of a jet-flap under various flight conditions. To do this, a general parametrical analysis is performed, studying numerically the influences of main flow parameters like Mach number, Reynolds number, angle of attack, jet deflection angle and jet thickness. Changes in pressure distribution and flow circulation around the airfoil yield strong modifications in lift and drag due to jet angle variation. Improvements are encountered in the performance of an airfoil with a jet-flap system compared with a standard airfoil with no jet. Enhancements in lift and reduction in drag, as well as an increase of the lift-to-drag ratio is possible with a proper combination of the jet deflection and the angle of attack of the airfoil. In summary, this paper shows the conditions under which the benefits of the jet-flapped wing, for lift enhancement and manoeuvrability as an active flow control are promising.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954410011414798" sec-type="intro"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Flight efficiency improvements have always driven aeronautical research in history. The recent research seems to go in the direction of more synergistic systems and novel aircraft configurations. It should be noted, that, as early as the 1930s, Attinello [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011414798">1</xref></bold>] and Kuchemman [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011414798">2</xref></bold>] proposed new aircraft configurations as the jet-wing with a large number of distributed small engines buried inside the wing having low jet velocity. This idea of distributing the propulsion to improve aircraft efficiency was recently tackled by Ko <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011414798">3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011414798">4</xref></bold>] and Schetz <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011414798">5</xref></bold>]. In a similar direction, new aircraft configurations as well as novel propulsion and flow control systems were suggested in review works [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011414798">6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011414798">7</xref></bold>], proposing thrust vectoring and other powered lift technologies for fuel burn reduction during take off and climb in commercial applications. With reference to thrust vectoring, it seems that a direct thrust vectored nozzle from the main engine is not possible for commercial aircraft applications because the pressure ratio of the fan is very low and the area of the outlet nozzle is quite big. Only in the case that higher pressure ratios and a smaller nozzle are used, a thrust vectored nozzle for the fan could be a feasible concept. Nevertheless, this would yield large losses in the propulsive efficiency.</p>
<p>In view of the above mentioned difficulties with the direct thrust vectoring, an alternative that appeals for efficiency improvements in a fan driven aircraft is the jet-flapped wing, as discussed in [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011414798">3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011414798">4</xref></bold>], where a Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft was analysed. In this works, part of the cold exhaust of a small number of high bypass ratio engines was bled to propulsive jets distributed along the wing trailing edge. Reduction in weight and fuel burning was assessed with this configuration. In the review article [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011414798">8</xref></bold>], a BWB aircraft with distributed propulsion and jet-flapped wing for lift enhancement as well as manoeuvrability was studied.</p>
<p>The promising features and the suitability of the jet-flapped wing system for distributed propulsion configuration can be inferred from the previous references. The advantages and design challenges of jet-flap technology are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954410011414798">Table 1</xref>, as derived from [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011414798">2</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011414798">8</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954410011414798">10</xref></bold>].

<p>With reference to the jet-flap technology, an analytical solution for inviscid and incompressible flow in 2D for an airfoil with a trailing edge jet had already been derived by Spence [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011414798">11</xref></bold>] in the 1950s. This classical solution is based on thin airfoil theory and is only valid for small angle of attack and jet deflection. Simple expressions for lift, pressure distribution and pitching moment were obtained in [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011414798">11</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>Similar assumptions to Spence’s theory were used in the review of the jet-flap technology by Williams <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954410011414798">12</xref></bold>], where it was clearly shown that an important increase in lift could be achieved with a jet deflection. In addition, the benefits in lift due to the ground effects, as well as the suitability of jet-flap systems in distributed propulsion configuration, were explained.</p>
<p>A numerical solution for airfoils with jet-flaps was developed by Ives and Melnik [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011414798">13</xref></bold>]. Their solution could be used to analyse jet-flaps in transonic inviscid flows using a finite difference scheme. Their work was focused on high lift applications for small and moderate jet coefficients. It was concluded that for a symmetric profile at an angle of attack of 0° and a flying Mach number of 0.7, the trailing edge jet deflection of 30° produced a lift of <italic>C</italic><sub>L</sub> = 0.7. A study of a supercritical airfoil with thick trailing edge was performed as well.</p>
<p>Kim and Saunders [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954410011414798">10</xref></bold>] performed a study for a symmetric airfoil at low speed with a large jet deflection and a high jet coefficient obtaining a lift increase. In more recent numerical studies of a jet-flap system [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410011414798">14</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410011414798">15</xref></bold>], some particular configurations were assessed. An increase in lift was obtained in all cases. All these studies were performed at low Mach number. In addition, the jet-flap deflection angle was fixed and the jet mass flow was small compared to the total thrust of the aircraft.</p>
<p>In view of the previous theoretical and numerical solutions available in the literature, a general study of a jet-flapped wing configuration on the influence of relevant parameters appears to be lacking. Therefore, a general parametric analysis of a jet-flap airfoil is performed in this paper. The influence of Mach number, Reynolds number, angle of attack, jet deflection angle and jet thickness on an airfoil in transonic flow are analysed numerically. The present analysis deals with general trends and the jet-flap airfoil performance for cruise conditions, shedding light on the use of this technology for manoeuvrability and cruise efficiency.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954410011414798"><title>2 PROBLEM CONFIGURATION</title>
<p>The jet-flap wing is conceived in this paper as a lift enhancement and manoeuvrability system in which a jet sheet is ejected from a slot at the trailing edge of the wing. The jet angle is varied to change the circulation around the wing, and thus to change the lift. An airfoil with a jet-flap is modelled in 2D at cruise conditions.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0954410011414798"><title>2.1 Airfoil selection</title>
<p>The study carried out is aimed at transonic flows, therefore a suitable airfoil is required. The airfoil RAE 2822 is selected due to its very wide use as validation case for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models in the transonic region. RAE 2822 is a 12 per cent thick supercritical airfoil with a moderate amount of aft loading. It was tested experimentally in the RAE 8 × 6 ft transonic wind tunnel [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410011414798">16</xref></bold>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954410011414798"><title>2.2 Flying conditions</title>
<p>For the purpose of the present study generic airfoil size has been chosen in order to allow the assessment of general trends and possible benefits. Moreover, in order to ensure applicability of the results, flight conditions and Reynolds number were chosen to match a typical aircraft wing at cruise conditions. Chosen cruise condition data in the tropopause for a standard static atmosphere and a cruise Mach number M = 0.73 are therefore summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410011414798">Table 2</xref>.

<p>The airfoil chord size selected is 10 m, which is representative of an aircraft wing. The Reynolds number (Re) based on the chord with the selected flying conditions is Re = 55 × 10<sup>6</sup>, which is in the order of the Re of a typical commercial aircraft. Moreover, for the validation of the CFD model, a 1 m chord airfoil is created to be able to match the Reynolds number of the experiments, Re = 6.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410011414798">16</xref></bold>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954410011414798"><title>2.3 Blunt trailing edge generation, jet thickness</title>
<p>In order to create a jet, the airfoil is cut at a certain distance from the Trailing Edge (TE). In this way a blunt trailing edge is created allowing the discharge of the jet. In order to study the influence of the thickness of the jet, the airfoil is cut at two different distances from the TE. The geometrical parameters are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954410011414798">Table 3</xref>, where it should be noted that no stretching of the cut blunt airfoil is considered.

<sec id="sec6-0954410011414798"><title>2.4 Jet angle definition</title>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011414798">Fig. 1</xref>, the jet angle <italic>τ</italic> is defined as the angle between the jet and the axis <italic>x<sub>b</sub></italic> of the airfoil body, which in the CFD model is the <italic>x</italic>-axis of the mesh. Positive jet angles <italic>τ</italic> mean deflection downwards and negative jet angles <italic>τ</italic> mean deflection upwards, being downwards in the negative <italic>y<sub>b</sub></italic>-direction and upwards in the positive <italic>y<sub>b</sub></italic>-direction. It is important to note that zero jet angle does not mean that the jet is ejected in the flow direction, as long as the angle of attack <italic>τ</italic> is different to zero. For a jet angle <italic>τ</italic> = 0, the angle between the jet and the flying direction is exactly the angle of attack <italic>α</italic>.
<fig id="fig1-0954410011414798" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Definition of body axis systems and jet angle</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011414798-fig1.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0954410011414798"><title>2.5 Mass flow rate of the jet</title>
<p>The jet nozzle is fully expanded, in order to avoid the impact of under-expanded jet plume forces on the airfoil pressure distribution. The mass flow rate going through the jet is calculated from the total pressure that would appear from bleeding the fan and conducting the flow to the jets in the wing trailing edge idea as in [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011414798">3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011414798">4</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011414798">8</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954410011414798">10</xref></bold>]. In the case studied herein, a high amount of the total thrust from the main engines is directed to the jet-flapped wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011414798">Fig. 2</xref>).
<fig id="fig2-0954410011414798" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Configuration of a BWB aircraft with distributed propulsion and jet-flapped wings</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011414798-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>For a fan pressure ratio (FPR) of 1.3, duct loss <italic>P<sub>t</sub><sub>j</sub></italic>/<italic>P<sub>t</sub></italic><sub>fan</sub> = 0.95, inlet loss <italic>P<sub>t</sub></italic><sub>1</sub>/<italic>P<sub>t</sub></italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.99 and a fan isentropic efficiency of <italic>η</italic><sub>fan</sub> = 0.9, the total pressure in the nozzle exit <italic>P<sub>tj</sub></italic> = 39 400 Pa and the static temperature <italic>T<sub>j</sub></italic> = 222K are calculated according to [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954410011414798">17</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>A CFD case is run to obtain the corresponding mass flow rate considering the total pressure as a jet boundary condition. The mass flow rate found for the standard jet thickness is 46 kg/s. The mass flow rate is selected as a jet boundary condition for all the parametric cases.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0954410011414798"><title>2.6 Thrust deflection</title>
<p>For a simple assessment, the jet gross thrust defined in the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-directions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011414798">Fig. 1</xref>), can be expressed as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0954410011414798"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011414798-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>

and the standard thrust in the drag (D) and lift (L) direction, <italic>T<sub>st</sub><sub>,</sub></italic><sub>D</sub> and <italic>T<sub>st</sub><sub>,</sub></italic><sub>L</sub>, is given as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0954410011414798"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011414798-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>

where <italic>V</italic><sub>0</sub> is the flying velocity and <italic>W</italic> the mass flow. There is no pressure term in the thrust, due to very low fan pressure ratio that has been chosen for maximising propulsive efficiency. The thrust developed by the jet in the different directions is low compared to the total airfoil drag for a thin jet, due to low jet velocities. Around less than one-third of the total airfoil drag is the thrust developed. However, the thrust is big enough as well as the flying velocity to account for the momentum drag term <italic>V</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>W</italic>. The angles of jet deflection are not too high. Therefore, the reduction of thrust in the D-direction with the jet bending is relatively small in view of Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954410011414798">3</xref>) for small values of <italic>α</italic> and relatively small values of τ. Moreover, the direct lift increase by thrust deflection [Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0954410011414798">4</xref>)], is very small because the lift developed by thrust deflection is, even at τ = 90°, in the order of the airfoil drag which is one order of magnitude smaller than the lift. To have a direct influence in the lift by thrust deflection, a jet with a chocked nozzle would be required to create sufficiently high velocity and hence gross thrust. In general, this would be possible only for a very high pressure ratio in the nozzle or post-combustion and in this manner the propulsive efficiency <italic>η</italic><sub>prop</sub> would drop significantly, defeating the propulsion system’s purpose for fuel efficiency. All these effects directed the study to the influence of the jet deflection on the lift of the wing, which is much stronger than the direct lift from the deflected thrust [Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0954410011414798">4</xref>)].</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0954410011414798"><title>3 COMPUTATIONAL MODEL</title>
<p>The parametric analysis of the jet-flap airfoil in transonic flow is carried out using the ANSYS CFX finite-volume implicitly coupled solver engine [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954410011414798">18</xref></bold>]. The compressible Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are solved using the high-resolution scheme and the two equation <italic>k–ω</italic> Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model over a structured mesh [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954410011414798">19</xref></bold>]. First, a baseline case to validate the approach is run comparing the numerical results obtained with the experimental ones [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410011414798">16</xref></bold>]. The models of the jet-flap airfoil are created using the same approach as for the clean baseline airfoil. The mesh is created in ANSYS ICEM CFD [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954410011414798">20</xref></bold>] and all the models are run as quasi 2D in CFX [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954410011414798">18</xref></bold>].</p>
<sec id="sec10-0954410011414798"><title>3.1 CFD mesh</title>
<p>A structured mesh is created based on the guidelines provided in [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954410011414798">21</xref></bold>]. The distance to the side and upstream boundary is 15<italic>c</italic> and to the downstream boundary is 20<italic>c</italic>, where <italic>c</italic> is the airfoil chord.

In addition, a geometric growth rate of 1.2 is used for the nodes in the boundary layer, in the direction perpendicular to the airfoil guaranteeing enough nodes inside the boundary layer [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954410011414798">21</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>The mesh is wrapped around the airfoil in a C-grid topology with 500 × 130 grid nodes, being 300 nodes over the airfoil and 200 in the wake region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011414798">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011414798">4</xref>). An H grid topology is created for the airfoil with blunt trailing edge with 100 × 50 grid nodes in the wake region for the 0.5 per cent thick jet and 100 × 80 grid nodes for the 1 per cent thick jet. The clustered node spacing of the boundary layer extended in the downstream direction is matched from the jet side forming a double boundary layer. This clustering of nodes in the mixing zone of the fast jet flow with the slow flow from the airfoil is very convenient in order to solve the high shear layer that appears there (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011414798">Fig. 5</xref>). For quasi 2D cases as in the present one, first a planar mesh is created and then it is extruded to 3D creating a quasi 2D domain of one element layer [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954410011414798">18</xref></bold>].

<p>A second-order derivatives approximation and energy equation are used because of the transonic nature of the flow with shock waves. As mentioned previously, turbulence model <italic>k–ω</italic> SST is selected due to the good approximation of jets spreading rate [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954410011414798">22</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>A non-slip adiabatic smooth wall boundary condition is used for the airfoil surface. The free-stream is simulated as a subsonic inlet and outlet boundary condition. The airfoil coordinate system is the same as the mesh coordinate system, since the airfoil is located with its reference line parallel to the <italic>x</italic>-direction in the mesh coordinate system. Changes in the angle of attack <italic>α</italic> are equivalent to changes in the flow direction. The flow direction is changed in the inlet boundary based on the Cartesian velocity components <italic>U</italic> = <italic>V</italic><sub>0</sub> cos(<italic>α</italic>) and <italic>V</italic> = <italic>V</italic><sub>0</sub> sin(<italic>α</italic>), which depends on the flying velocity <italic>V</italic><sub>0</sub> and the angle of attack <italic>α</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011414798">Fig. 1</xref>). In addition, the static temperature is set and a low turbulence intensity of 1 per cent is used. The outlet boundary condition is imposed using averaged static pressure with a profile blend of 0.05. The jet at the trailing edge of the airfoil is modelled as a subsonic inlet condition with a certain mass flow rate, static temperature and flow direction.

<p>The convergence of the second order RANS is assumed to be achieved when all RMS residuals fall at least five orders of magnitude (RMS ≤ 10<sup>−5</sup>), the monitored forces on the airfoil are stable with no oscillation and the imbalance of energy, mass and momentum is much smaller than 0.1 per cent.</p></sec>

The results for three meshes are compared with the experiments and a grid dependency study is carried out. This comparison is used for validation of the approach and as a baseline for the next more complex cases.

<p>The drag is calculated as the integral of the forces around the surface. In this case, since the jet nozzle is adapted, <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> = <italic>p<sub>j</sub></italic>; this exactly matches the drag definition, which requires the drag calculation to be between two points with upstream infinity static pressure. For the case of blunt trailing edge without jet, the drag and lift are calculated as an integral over the whole airfoil surface including the blunt zone.</p>
<p>The variation of the lift with the angle of attack <italic>α</italic> and of the lift with drag for the baseline RAE2822 (sharp trailing edge) and the airfoil with blunt trailing edge (no jet) are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011414798">Fig. 8</xref>. The sharp trailing edge airfoil has better performance than the airfoil with blunt trailing edge. A fall in the slope of the CL, as well as a drag increase at high angle of attack produced by the boundary layer separation, can be observed. This boundary layer separation at high angles of attack, as well as its growth at the shock wave base can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011414798">Fig. 9</xref>, where the velocity contours near the boundary layer are presented for angles of attack of <italic>α</italic> = 2.6° and <italic>α</italic> = 6°, respectively.

<p>This phenomenon can be explained with the effects of the jet in the rear part of the airfoil near the TE.</p>
<sec id="sec15-0954410011414798"><title>4.1.1 Downwards jet deflection, τ &gt; 0</title>
<p>In the upper zone of the TE the flow needs to bend downwards to follow the jet direction. This produces an increase in velocity which entails a reduction in pressure. This reduction in pressure at the rear part of the upper surface reduces the adverse pressure gradient. This can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011414798">Fig. 10</xref> as a reduction in the slope of the <italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> that rises in the recompression zone produced in the rear part of the upper surface. This pressure reduction influences the whole upper surface increasing the suction and, therefore, moving the shockwave rearwards. The opposite behaviour occurs at the lower surface. The deflection of the jet produces a compression since the velocity reduces near the TE. This compression near the TE affects the rest of the lower surface with an increase in pressure.</p>
<p>The difference in pressure between the lower and the upper surface of the airfoil creates the lift. Therefore, expanding of the <italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> curve area leads to a lift increase. In some way the jet can be seen as a structural flap of an airfoil, which increases the curvature of the airfoil + jet system, increasing the circulation and causing a rise in the lift.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec16-0954410011414798"><title>4.1.2 Upwards jet deflection, τ &lt; 0</title>
<p>This case is just the opposite to that in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec15-0954410011414798">section 4.1.1</xref>. The deflection of the jet upwards creates a compression in the rear part of the upper surface. This increases the adverse pressure gradient and affects the rest of the suction zone raising the pressure and consequently reducing the suction. This moves the shockwave forward since the compression in the shockwave is produced earlier, because of the higher pressure produced by the jet. At the lower surface the flow is accelerated near the trailing edge in order to follow the deflected jet. This reduces the flow pressure affecting the entire lower surface, causing a general reduction in compression along the low surface. This configuration is equivalent to a structural flap bending upwards reducing the airfoil + jet system curvature and reducing the lift.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec17-0954410011414798"><title>4.2 Effect of the angle of attack</title>
<p>Three different angles of attack are studied: <italic>α</italic> = 0°, 2.6°, and 4°. The effects of the angle of attack and the jet angle on the lift and drag coefficient are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954410011414798">Figs 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954410011414798">14</xref>. There is an obvious increase in the lift with the jet angle deflection, while at the same time there is a drag increase. An increase in lift entails an increase in drag as generally observed.
<fig id="fig13-0954410011414798" position="float"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption><p>Lift coefficient plotted against jet angle for different angles of attack</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011414798-fig13.tif"/></fig>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954410011414798">Fig. 15</xref> it appears that the drag can be smaller for the same lift using the jet-flapped airfoil instead of a standard airfoil.
<fig id="fig15-0954410011414798" position="float"><label>Fig. 15</label><caption><p>Lift versus drag coefficients for different angles of attack</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011414798-fig15.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The jet-flap airfoil is a complex problem with nonlinearities due to the onset of separation. There are three main parameters that affect the airfoil performance in this case: the angle of attack of the airfoil <italic>α</italic>, the jet deflection angle <italic>τ</italic> equivalent to apparent curvature augmentation or reduction, and the location of the onset of separation.</p>
<p>It seems that a low angle of attack has a very good lift-to-drag ratio, but lower total lift in general (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954410011414798">Fig. 15</xref>). This is because the adverse pressure gradient is small, having a smooth <italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> distribution. Therefore, the fluid at the upper surface of the TE is not separated and the boundary layer is in good condition. The apparent change of curvature due to the jet angle variation produces a smooth transition and a very good response of the flow around the airfoil. This leads to a high increase or decrease of the lift with small changes of the drag producing big changes in the lift-to-drag ratio (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954410011414798">Figs 15</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954410011414798">16</xref>).
<fig id="fig16-0954410011414798" position="float"><label>Fig. 16</label><caption><p>Lift to drag ratio plotted against the jet angle for different angles of attack</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011414798-fig16.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It appears that for medium angles of attack the response to apparent changes in the curvature is not as good as in the case of low angles of attack, because when the jet angle <italic>τ</italic> is increased the adverse pressure gradient increases, producing a boundary layer separation. This explains the reduction in the lift-to-drag ratio for high values of <italic>τ</italic>. Similarly, for a negative deflection, negative values of <italic>τ</italic>, the lift is considerably reduced because the reduction in the adverse pressure gradient allows a good response of the flow around the airfoil and therefore produces a lift reduction.</p>
<p>At high angles of attack <italic>α</italic>, the airfoil is near its peak lift. This leads to a very sensible point in which a small increase in apparent curvature due to jet deflection lead to boundary layer separation and lift-to-drag ratio decrease, similar to the performance for a medium angle of attack. At negative jet angles with reduction of the apparent curvature there is no response of decreasing lift. This seems to be because of the bad condition of the boundary layer at the TE, which prevents the response of the flow to the jet bending and does not allow enough modification of the <italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> distribution to create lift. However, the drag of the airfoil is reduced yielding a general increase of lift-to-drag ratio.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec18-0954410011414798"><title>4.3 Effects of flying Mach number</title>
<p>Three different Mach numbers are considered, M = 0.66, 0.73, and 0.8 for a constant angle of attack, <italic>α</italic> = 2.6°. The influence of the Mach number in the lift and drag with varying jet deflection is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954410011414798">Figs. 17</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954410011414798">18</xref>.
<fig id="fig17-0954410011414798" position="float"><label>Fig. 17</label><caption><p>Lift coefficient plotted against jet angle for different Mach number</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011414798-fig17.tif"/></fig>

<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954410011414798">Fig. 18</xref> it can be inferred that the drag increases with Mach number. Moreover, the increase of drag is much bigger for a Mach between 0.73 and 0.8 than for a Mach number between 0.66 and 0.73. This behaviour could be because of the drag divergence of the airfoil. The lift rises with an increase in Mach number from 0.66 to 0.73, but then it falls with further Mach number increase. This might be produced by the lower efficiency of the airfoil at very high Mach number. The drag rises due to a jet deflection increase with the Mach number. A similar effect to the angle of attack, <italic>α</italic>, is noticed.</p>
<p>The benefits are higher at lower Mach number. The lift achieved is higher and the drag much lower (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0954410011414798">Fig. 19</xref>). It appears that the jet-flapped airfoil performance improves a lot with Mach number reduction. The jet mass flow rate, Mach number and, therefore, the jet velocity are the same for all Mach flying conditions. Thus, with a flying Mach increase, the ratio of the jet velocity to flying velocity is lower; this could be an explanation why at lower flying Mach number the performance is better.

<p>The improvement with Mach number reduction implies that the lift enhancement of a wing with jet-flap system for take-off applications would be even higher than the one assessed in this study.

<p>The Reynolds number is varied between Re = 55 × 10<sup>6</sup> and Re = 5.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>. The Reynolds number is varied, through adjusting the chord of the airfoil. In this way, all the other parameters are constant. The effect of the Reynolds number on the lift and drag is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0954410011414798">Figs 20</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-0954410011414798">21</xref>.

<p>A Reynolds number increase has a positive effect on the jet; higher lift is achieved with lower drag (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-0954410011414798">Fig. 22</xref>).

<sec id="sec20-0954410011414798"><title>4.5 Jet thickness effects</title>
<p>Two cases with different jet thickness are studied. The standard thickness <italic>δ</italic> = 0.5 per cent of <italic>c</italic> and the expanded jet <italic>δ</italic> = 1 per cent of <italic>c</italic>. Thus, the expanded jet is twice the standard. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23-0954410011414798">Figs 23</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24-0954410011414798">24</xref> the influence of the jet thickness on the lift and drag variation is shown, where it becomes apparent that thickness has a direct impact on the effect of jet angle on performance. As a result, airfoil lift and drag for the thicker jet are more sensitive to jet angle variations. Higher drag for a positive jet angle deflection and lower drag for a negative jet angle are achieved, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25-0954410011414798">Fig. 25</xref>.

<p>If the jet-flapped wing is used for manoeuvrability, the thicker jet is undoubtedly a better option since a stronger difference in lift can be achieved with positive and negative deflections.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec21-0954410011414798" sec-type="conclusions"><title>5 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>A 2D computational assessment of a jet-flapped airfoil performance at cruise conditions in transonic flow is carried out. The agreement of the CFD model of the airfoil RAE 2822 with the experimental results provided in [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410011414798">16</xref></bold>] is found to be very good and, therefore, the CFD approach can be used as a base to assess the jet-flap airfoil performance. Constant mass flow is assumed and the jet angle is deflected from −20° to 30°, whilst the angle of attack, Mach number, Reynolds number, and jet thickness are varied.</p>
<p>In general, the best performance is achieved at moderate and low angles of attack. Very low angles of attack do not create much lift, but the lift-to-drag ratio at high jet deflections is the best. Best lift, in conjunction with high lift-to-drag ratio are identified at moderate angles of attack and moderate jet deflections, since too high positive jet deflections for moderate and high angles of attack (<italic>α</italic> = 2.6°, 4°, respectively) produce losses.</p>
<p>The Mach number reduction has been shown to improve the jet configuration performance, increasing the lift and reducing the drag at positive jet deflections. The Reynolds number has an opposite trend, as better features are found at larger Reynolds number with higher lift and lower drag.</p>
<p>Regarding the thickness of the jet, manoeuvrability-wise, a thicker jet proved to be the most suitable with higher lift variation for different jet angle deflections.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the implementation of jet-flap technology allows an extra degree of freedom in the control of the wing performance. In more detail, at certain flight conditions, wing circulation may be increased by jet deflection, rather than high angle of attack, enabling better control over the position of the shock wave on the suction surface and optimisation of lift over drag. From this observation, it appears that best performance for high lift requirements is achieved through deflecting the jet angle to its maximum, and for further lift enhancement, increasing the angle of attack. Furthermore, lift augmentation beyond the maximum lift of a standard airfoil can also be achieved. These features of the jet-flap wing can lead to a more efficient climb through increasing lift at lower drag cost. In addition, the implementation of jet-flap technology is also favourable in terms of manoeuvrability and aircraft trimming at cruise, where wing efficiency is essential, as it is shown that at low angles of attack the lift variations have almost negligible effects on drag compared to a standard airfoil. Nevertheless, follow up research, on the development of jet-flap wing control optimisation schemes, would be required to investigate and materialise the potential benefits from the extra degree of freedom offered by the jet deflection angle.</p></sec>
