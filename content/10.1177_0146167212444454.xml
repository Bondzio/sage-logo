<abstract>
<p>Two studies documented the “David and Goliath” rule—the tendency for people to perceive criticism of “David” groups (groups with low power and status) as less normatively permissible than criticism of “Goliath” groups (groups with high power and status). The authors confirmed the existence of the David and Goliath rule across Western and Chinese cultures (Study 1). However, the rule was endorsed more strongly in Western than in Chinese cultures, an effect mediated by cultural differences in power distance. Study 2 identified the psychological underpinnings of this rule in an Australian sample. Lower social dominance orientation (SDO) was associated with greater endorsement of the rule, an effect mediated through the differential attribution of stereotypes. Specifically, those low in SDO were more likely to attribute traits of warmth and incompetence to David versus Goliath groups, a pattern of stereotypes that was related to the protection of David groups from criticism.</p>

<p>One of the most well-understood rules of social conduct is that people should not criticize others without restraint. Every day people inhibit negative thoughts or judgments of others, even those they are convinced are accurate. What is true at the interpersonal level applies also at the group level: “Rules of engagement” have developed that help shape when—and in what contexts—it is considered appropriate to deliver criticism of one’s own group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212444454">Ariyanto, Hornsey, &amp; Gallois, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212444454">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212444454">Douglas &amp; Sutton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212444454">Hornsey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212444454">Hornsey, Grice, Jetten, Paulsen, &amp; Callan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167212444454">Hornsey &amp; Imani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167212444454">Sutton, Elder, &amp; Douglas, 2006</xref>). People who conform to these (largely implicit) rules are in a stronger position to drive reform and positive change from within their group than are those who make criticisms without regard to social convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212444454">Hornsey, Jeffries, &amp; Esposo, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Even more so than criticizing one’s own group, criticizing <italic>outgroups</italic> is a delicate and dangerous communicative act. Intergroup relations would be particularly strained and conflict rampant if people did not hesitate to voice critical thoughts they held toward other ethnic groups, religions, nations, and professions. It is likely, then, that social conventions would have emerged to help guide these communications. For example, certain groups in society may be considered more or less “off-limits” for criticism, in the sense that one would withhold expressing a criticism of that group even where it was justified. But there is little empirical analysis that can catalog and make sense of these implicit normative rules. This article examines which groups are seen to be off-limits for criticism, the cross-cultural consistency of these effects, and the psychological mechanisms that lead people to make those decisions.</p>
<p>Drawing on theories of (a) feedback and (b) intergroup relations, we propose (and demonstrate) that it is more normatively permissible to express criticisms of groups with high status and power than groups with low status and power, a tendency we refer to here as the David and Goliath rule. It is further demonstrated that this rule is more likely to be endorsed in low-power distance cultures (Study 1) and among individuals who are low in social dominance orientation (SDO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212444454">Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, &amp; Malle, 1994</xref>; Study 2). We show that people lower in SDO are more inclined to attribute traits of warmth and incompetence to groups low in status and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167212444454">Kay, Czaplinski, &amp; Jost, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212444454">Pratto et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167212444454">Pratto, Tatar, &amp; Conway-Lanz, 1999</xref>), resulting in a desire to “protect” those groups from criticism (Study 2).</p>
<p>There are at least two reasons why these research questions are important. First, criticisms carry huge potential for hurt, defensiveness, withdrawal, and hostility. There are rules or social conventions around the delivery of group criticism that help reduce these negative consequences, and understanding these implicit rules gives people an advantage in navigating their social worlds. By cataloging and exploring the psychological bases for these rules, the current studies have the potential to increase healthy and happy intergroup and intragroup communication.</p>
<p>The second reason why understanding group criticism is important is because criticism carries the potential for growth and positive change. Based on the assumption that people have a fundamental need to feel good about themselves, criticism of their groups may be inherently aversive because it threatens their (extended) self-concept. However, most people are also aware that <italic>legitimate</italic> criticism can be valuable, because it suggests avenues for improvement. It should be noted, then, that we do not necessarily intend the term <italic>criticism</italic> to be interpreted as an unambiguously negative act, and we do not assume that the motives behind criticism are always destructive. Sometimes, criticisms are valuable to prevent groups repeating their mistakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167212444454">Morrison &amp; Milliken, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212444454">Packer, 2008</xref>). Indeed, groups that do not encourage open and honest airing of inconvenient truths are prone to maladaptive, stagnant, and occasionally disastrous decision making (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167212444454">Janis, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167212444454">Moscovici, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167212444454">Nemeth &amp; Owens, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212444454">Postmes, Spears, &amp; Cihangir, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In framing predictions around the normative protection of groups from criticism, we draw on two literatures that point in slightly different directions: research on prejudice and research on the positive-feedback bias. These literatures are reviewed in the following.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167212444454">
<title>Are Low-Status Groups More or Less Likely to be Targets of Criticism?</title>
<p>Research on prejudice and discrimination suggests that groups low in status and power would be especially likely to be targets of critical attack. Such groups are often the targets of bullying campaigns, negative attitudes, and persecution (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212444454">Crocker, Major, &amp; Steele, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167212444454">Jones et al., 1984</xref>). Not only should people be more likely to <italic>think</italic> negative thoughts about low-status groups, they should be more willing to <italic>express</italic> those negative thoughts, as the relative powerlessness of these groups means that they are less capable of fighting back. In this sense, relatively disadvantaged groups are safe targets for negativity, a point that is central to many “scapegoat” theories of intergroup conflict (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212444454">Adorno et al., 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212444454">Dollard, Miller, Doob, Mowrer, &amp; Sears, 1939</xref>). Another reason for people to be more willing to express negative opinions of low-status groups is that they feel more normatively permitted to do so. This is because low-status groups attract more negative stereotypes than high-status groups, and these negative views are more likely to be consensualized and shared by the broader population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212444454">Crandall, Eshleman, &amp; O’Brien, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>However, one can draw on different literatures to construct the reverse prediction: that groups low in status and power will be seen to be more off-limits than groups relatively high in status and power. In educational and organizational contexts, there is evidence suggesting low-status and low-power groups are the recipients of <italic>less</italic> negative feedback, also referred to as a “positive-feedback bias.” For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212444454">Hastorf, Northcraft, and Piucciotto (1979)</xref> asked participants to provide performance feedback to a confederate, presented as either handicapped (wheelchair bound) or able bodied. Although the task was performed equally well, performance feedback provided to the handicapped confederate was less critical and in general more positive than that given to the able-bodied confederate. Hastorf and colleagues controlled for performance expectations, therefore ruling out the alternative explanation that the handicapped confederate was evaluated more favorably because participants had lower expectations for performance. This positive-feedback bias has been identified in relation to racial minorities as well. Harber and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212444454">Harber, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212444454">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212444454">Harber, Stafford, &amp; Kennedy, 2010</xref>) asked White undergraduate students to provide feedback on essays that they were led to believe were written by either a Black or White student. It has been consistently demonstrated that Whites provide less critical essay feedback to Blacks than to fellow White students.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212444454">Hastorf et al. (1979)</xref> posited that the reluctance to communicate negative feedback to the handicapped may be motivated by a <italic>norm to be kind</italic>. That is, there is a societal norm in Western society that one must be kind to those less fortunate than ourselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212444454">Harber and colleagues (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212444454">2010</xref>) found that egalitarian self-image concerns underlie the positive-feedback bias. Whites favorably biased their feedback to minorities in order to see themselves as egalitarian; however, when self-image concerns were eased, the feedback bias disappeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212444454">Harber et al., 2010</xref>). Variants of the norm to be kind phenomenon have previously been established by a number of researchers who have demonstrated that the desire to avoid being prejudiced manifests itself in hesitancy to express nonegalitarian attitudes and (occasionally) in the granting of preferential treatment to minorities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212444454">Devine, Monteith, Zuwerink, &amp; Elliot, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212444454">Dutton &amp; Lake, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167212444454">Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 1986</xref>). It also mirrors the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167212444454">Monin and Miller (2001)</xref> in which participants who had established credentials as being nonprejudiced revealed a greater willingness to express attitudes that could be viewed as prejudiced.</p>
<p>The “norm to be kind to the disadvantaged” is akin to the norms of social responsibility discussed in social decision-making research. There is growing evidence that power induces feelings of social responsibility, making people behave benevolently toward those who are in need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212444454">Frieze &amp; Boneva, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212444454">Gardner &amp; Seeley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167212444454">Lee &amp; Tiedens, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167212444454">Handgraaf et al. (2008)</xref> argue that when power-holders face powerless counterparts who have no means to strike back, strategic considerations become less important and give way to other, more prosocial motives. Indeed, using ultimatum games, participants have demonstrated a degree of benevolent paternalism or “noblesse oblige” with respect to powerless others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167212444454">Handgraaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167212444454">van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000</xref>). Although the focus of the feedback in previous literature has been individuals rather than groups, these studies suggest that groups low in status and power (the so-called David groups in society) will be viewed as less appropriate targets of criticism than groups high in status and power (the so-called Goliath groups in society).</p>

<title>The Present Research</title>
<p>This program of research aims to identify and understand the social conventions regarding the appropriateness of criticizing social groups that vary in status and power. First, given contrasting predictions suggested by previous research, we examine whether groups relatively low in status and power are less appropriate targets of criticism compared with groups relatively high in status and power and the cross-cultural consistency of these conventions (Study 1). We also seek to establish an explanatory mechanism for cultural differences, namely, endorsement of a power distance ideology (Study 1). We then aim to establish the psychological mechanisms that lead to the normative protection of low-status and low-power groups within a Western cultural context. More specifically, we examine the role of SDO and complementary stereotypes in the differing appropriateness of criticizing low and high status and power groups (Study 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0146167212444454">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>Study 1 was designed to establish that groups relatively low in status and power are perceived as less appropriate targets of criticism compared with groups relatively high in status and power. We also sought to examine whether (and why) this effect is moderated by culture. There are reasons to suspect that the normative protection from criticism of groups low in status and power might be subscribed to more strongly in some cultural groups than others. For example, power distance refers to how much hierarchical inequality in institutions and practices people will accept and regard as natural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212444454">Hofstede, 2001</xref>). Although inequality exists within any culture, the degree to which it is tolerated can vary across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212444454">Chinese Cultural Connection, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212444454">Hofstede, 2001</xref>). In high-power distance cultures such as China, inequality is viewed as acceptable and the natural order. As such, people in high-power distance cultures are relatively likely to believe that they should respect and obey those with power and adhere to organizational hierarchy. In contrast, people in low-power distance cultures such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia tend to hold the value that everyone should have a voice and attempt to reduce inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212444454">Page &amp; Wiseman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167212444454">Spencer-Oatey, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Because there is a greater acceptance of (and comfort with) institutional power differences in Chinese cultures than in Western cultures, we expect that the extent to which groups are normatively protected from criticism may also vary. That is, Chinese cultures may be less likely than Western cultures to protect groups low in status and power from criticism and may be more likely than Western cultures to protect groups high in status and power from criticism.</p>
<p>We collected data in three Western cultures (Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and two Chinese cultures (Hong Kong and Mainland China). The three Western nations were chosen because they are considered to be relatively low in power distance, whereas the two Chinese nations were chosen because they are considered to be relatively high in power distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212444454">Hofstede, 2001</xref>). Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which 18 groups were appropriate to criticize. Low-status and low-power groups included third world nations, rural people, working class, mentally ill, homosexuals, the homeless, immigrant groups, the disabled, and the overweight. High-status and high-power groups were first world nations, urban people, middle class, upper class, privileged groups, governments, leaders of large corporations (e.g., CEOs), sporting teams, and media groups. Participants’ endorsement of power distance ideologies was also measured.</p>
<p>To recap, we predicted that a David and Goliath rule would emerge, such that groups relatively low in status and power would be seen to be less normatively permissible to criticize (i.e., more “off-limits”) than groups with relatively high status and power. We predicted that this effect would be more pronounced in Western than Chinese samples, an effect mediated by the higher endorsement of power distance ideologies in Chinese cultures.</p>

<title>Examination of rules surrounding criticism appropriateness</title>
<p>To examine the factor structure of the items relating to appropriateness to criticize groups, a factor analysis with varimax rotation was conducted. The scree test revealed a two-factor solution with the first factor comprising the groups previously identified as Goliath groups (first world nations, urban people, middle class, upper class, privileged groups, governments, leaders of large corporations, sporting teams, and media groups; eigenvalue = 9.57, 53.18% of variance) and the second factor comprising the David groups (third world nations, rural people, working class, mentally ill, homosexuals, the homeless, immigrant groups, the disabled and the overweight; eigenvalue = 2.78, 15.45% of variance). Scores for the “David” groups (α = .90) and the “Goliath” groups (α = .94) were averaged, combined, and compared using repeated measures ANOVA.</p>
<p>Consistent with the hypothesis that groups relatively low in status and power would be protected from criticism, the David groups (<italic>M</italic> = 5.60, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.66) were considered less appropriate to criticize relative to the Goliath groups (<italic>M</italic> = 6.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.70), <italic>F</italic>(1, 815) = 395.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0146167212444454">

<title>Culture moderates the David and Goliath effect</title>
<p>We next examined whether Western and Chinese cultures differed in the extent to which they viewed David and Goliath groups as appropriate to criticize. To conduct these analyses, the five national samples were dichotomized into those from Western cultures (United Kingdom, United States, and Australia) versus those from Chinese cultures (Mainland China and Hong Kong). Before doing the main analyses, we explored whether there were systematic demographic differences between samples that could influence the outcomes. When entered in regression, an increase in age was associated with an increase in rule endorsement (β = .32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Participant age was also significantly higher in Chinese cultures compared with Western cultures. As a result, age was entered as a covariate. However, because the overall interpretation did not differ with the covariates included, the final analyses reported do not include this covariate. Thus, a 2 × 2 mixed ANOVA was conducted in which Culture (Western vs. Chinese) was the between-groups factor and Target Group (David vs. Goliath groups) was the within-subjects factor.</p>

<p>To explore the potential mediating role of power distance, a series of regressions were performed using culture (Western cultures = 1; Chinese cultures = −1) and power distance as the predictors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167212444454">Figure 2</xref>). The criterion variable was the average difference score between each participant’s ratings of criticism appropriateness for the David groups subtracted from ratings of criticism appropriateness for the Goliath groups. The difference score was calculated such that higher scores indicated greater endorsement of the David and Goliath rule.</p>

<p>In line with the effects previously reported, culture was a significant predictor of rule endorsement. In a separate regression, culture was also a significant predictor of power distance. When rule endorsement was regressed simultaneously on culture and power distance, power distance was a significant predictor of rule endorsement and the effect of culture decreased, suggesting a partial mediation effect.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212444454">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref>, the indirect effects of culture on rule endorsement through power distance were computed from unstandardized regression weights with 5,000 bootstrap resamples. The total indirect effect was significant with the 95% bootstrap confidence interval (CI) excluding zero (indirect effect (IE) = .16, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03, BCa 95% CI = [.11, .22]). Thus, supporting our predictions, Chinese cultures endorsed the David and Goliath rule to a lesser extent because of a greater acceptance of (or comfort with) institutional power differences.</p>

<sec id="section13-0146167212444454">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first goal of Study 1 was to identify whether there was a clear pattern in people’s perceptions of which social groups were more or less normatively permissible to criticize. The answer is yes: Groups that are relatively high in status and/or power (Goliath groups) were seen as more appropriate targets of criticism compared with groups relatively low in status and/or power (David groups). Furthermore, Western cultures endorsed the David and Goliath rule to a greater extent than Chinese cultures. The differential endorsement of the rule is driven partly by the tendency for Chinese cultures to be more critical of the David groups than the Western cultures and partly by the tendency for the Chinese cultures to be less critical of the Goliath groups than Western cultures. Furthermore, compared with Western samples, the Chinese samples reported a greater acceptance or comfort with power differences in societal institutions. These differences in power distance help to explain why the David and Goliath effect is weaker in Chinese cultures.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0146167212444454">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>Study 1 established that, within Western cultures at least, there is a robust tendency for people to see Goliath groups as more appropriate to criticize than David groups. In Study 2, we focus on the psychological mechanisms associated with the endorsement of the David and Goliath rule within a Western cultural setting.</p>
<p>The stereotype content model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167212444454">Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002</xref>) provides a framework for understanding why groups low in power and status might be off-limits to criticism. Groups that are relatively low in both status and power tend to attract stereotypes of being low in competence and high in warmth. According to the stereotype content model, these groups tend to attract pity and are treated in a paternalistic fashion, which in some cases could be interpreted as a benevolent form of prejudice. It could be that our David groups are being “protected” from criticism because they are seen to be relatively low in competence and high in warmth when compared with our Goliath groups. In Study 2, we test this hypothesis directly.</p>
<p>Another factor that may influence the extent to which people protect (or confront) low-status groups is the extent to which they endorse a social dominance ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212444454">Pratto et al., 1994</xref>). Social dominance ideology measures individual differences in ideological beliefs surrounding group inequality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212444454">Pratto et al. (1994)</xref> describe SDO as “a general attitudinal orientation toward intergroup relations, reflecting whether one generally prefers such relations to be equal, versus hierarchical” (p. 742). As such, it draws parallel to the value dimension of power distance often revealed in cross-cultural studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212444454">Duckitt, 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167212444454">Ekehammar, Akrami, Gylje, &amp; Zakrisson, 2004</xref>, for a similar argument). It has also been posited that power distance and social dominance ideologies serve a similar function, namely, to legitimize existing social arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212444454">Jost &amp; Hunyady, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167212444454">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>People high in SDO support a hierarchical society and the notion that groups are not equal. People low in SDO support a society in which all groups are treated equally and groups are not defined by status and power. Indeed, people higher in SDO are more racist, nationalistic, and conservative than people lower in SDO, whereas people lower in SDO believe more in noblesse oblige (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167212444454">Pratto, Stallworth, &amp; Conway-Lanz, 1998</xref>). It is therefore reasonable to expect that SDO would be directly related to people’s willingness to express critical attitudes toward groups at different levels of the hierarchy. Because of their discomfort at the notion of status differences, people low in SDO may look to “protect” low-status and low-power groups from criticism while seeking to “bring down” high-status groups by being especially willing to deliver critical feedback toward them. In contrast, those high in SDO—people who are relatively comfortable with a system that allows for status hierarchies—may be less likely to take status or power into account when making the decision about whether to articulate group criticism.</p>
<p>If we are to link the research on SDO with the research on group-based perceptions of warmth and competence trait stereotypes, an indirect relationship between SDO and willingness to express critical feedback could be predicted. Even people who score relatively low on system justifying ideologies are motivated to satisfy their system justification needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167212444454">Kay &amp; Jost, 2003</xref>). This can be achieved through <italic>victim derogation</italic> or <italic>victim enhancement</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167212444454">Kay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167212444454">Kay &amp; Jost, 2003</xref>). One classic victim enhancement strategy is to compensate for negative stereotypes on the competence domain by embracing stereotypes of low-status groups as warm (and by extension happy, community-minded, and “soulful”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167212444454">Jost, Burgess, &amp; Mosso, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167212444454">Kay &amp; Jost, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212444454">Kay, Jost, &amp; Young, 2005</xref>). It is this combination (high in warmth; low in competence) that we predict is associated with the protecting of low-status groups from criticism. From this perspective, individual differences in SDO may be associated with differences in motivation to stereotype low-status groups as warm yet incompetent, which in turn influence willingness to express negative feedback.</p>
<p>To recap, we predicted that those lower in SDO (i.e., people who support a society in which all groups are treated equally) would more strongly endorse the David and Goliath rule compared with those higher in SDO (i.e., people who support a hierarchical society). We predicted that this effect would be mediated by the greater attribution of complementary stereotypes (i.e., high warmth; low competence) toward David groups by those lower in SDO when compared with those higher in SDO. Study 2 addresses these hypotheses directly.</p>
<p>Participants rated 23 groups according to whether they were “off-limits” for criticism (they would not criticize these groups even if they felt the criticisms were fair) or “fair game” (they would feel free to criticize these groups if they felt the criticisms were fair). Perceptions of warmth and competence for each group were measured, as well as SDO. In order to certify that the David groups were perceived as relatively low in status and power relative to the Goliath groups, participants also provided ratings of status and power for each group.</p>

<p>In the first phase (Time 1), participants completed a measure of SDO and rated 23 groups on dimensions of warmth, competence, status, and power. Approximately 1 week later (Time 2), participants completed another online survey measuring attitudes toward criticizing the same target groups. The list of groups varied from Study 1 such that broad cultural labels (e.g., sporting icons, media, privileged, minorities) were withdrawn and replaced by groups specific to Australian society (e.g., Indigenous Australians). The groups were Australians, New Zealanders, Europeans, Americans, British, Africans, third world nations, immigrants, single parents, mentally ill, disabled, overweight people, homosexuals, rural people, Aboriginal Australians, first world nations, urban people, working class, middle class, upper class, celebrities, homeless, and welfare recipients. In all, 208 participants (76 females; <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub> = 46.43; <italic>SD</italic> = 16.15) who responded at Time 1 also completed the Time 2 survey.

<title>Processes underpinning the David and Goliath rule</title>
<p>First, we wanted to establish whether stereotype trait attributions were associated with endorsement of the David and Goliath rule. For each participant, difference scores were created by subtracting David group ratings from Goliath group ratings on warmth, competence, and criticism appropriateness. This allowed us to examine whether differences in perceptions of competence and warmth between the David and Goliath groups predicted differences in criticism appropriateness. Relative criticism appropriateness is subsequently referred to as “rule endorsement” (i.e., tendency to perceive David groups as less appropriate to criticize relative to Goliath groups).</p>
<p>We regressed rule endorsement on (the difference scores of) warmth and competence at Step 1, followed by the interaction between warmth and competence at Step 2 (all predictors were centered). At Step 1, differential warmth (β = −.26, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001) and competence (β = .31, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001) accounted for a significant proportion of variance, <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = .11, <italic>F</italic>(2, 205) = 13.02, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001. The more people perceived the David groups to be relatively warm compared with Goliath groups, the more they endorsed the David and Goliath rule. Furthermore, the more they perceived the Goliath groups to be relatively competent compared with David groups, the more they endorsed the David and Goliath rule.</p>
<p>The addition of the interaction between warmth and competence increased the proportion of variance explained at Step 2, <inline-formula id="inline-formula10-0146167212444454">

Simple slopes analyses revealed that, when lower competence is attributed to David groups relative to Goliath groups (i.e., a larger competence difference score), warmth is a significant predictor of rule endorsement (β = −.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The slope replicates the main effect: People endorse the David and Goliath rule more to the extent that they see the David groups as relatively warm compared with the Goliath groups. In contrast, when the differential attribution of competence between David and Goliath groups was relatively small (i.e., a smaller competence difference score), there was no significant relationship between warmth and rule endorsement (β = .20, <italic>p</italic> = .253). As predicted, then, the combination of high warmth and low competence to David groups was associated with the view that David groups are less appropriate targets of criticism. Another way in which to interpret this finding is that the combination of low warmth and high competence to Goliath groups was associated with the tendency to view Goliath groups as more appropriate targets of criticism.</p>

<title>SDO and the David and Goliath rule</title>
<p>A series of regression analyses were conducted to test the direct effect of SDO on rule endorsement and the mediators of that effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0146167212444454">Figure 3</xref>). In line with predictions, the lower people were in SDO, the more they endorsed the David and Goliath rule (β = −.20, <italic>p</italic> = .005).</p>

<p>Differential warmth (β = .24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) but not competence (β = −.08, <italic>p</italic> = .230) shared a significant association with SDO. The warmth by competence interaction, however, shared a significant association with SDO (β = −.15, <italic>p</italic> = .028). Therefore, in line with predictions, people lower in SDO are more likely to endorse complementary stereotypes of David groups being relatively low in competence and high in warmth. When SDO and the warmth by competence interaction were entered simultaneously, SDO was no longer predictive of rule endorsement (β = −.13, <italic>p</italic> = .06), whereas the warmth by competence interaction was predictive (β = −.30, <italic>p</italic> = .004). The warmth by competence interaction is therefore considered as a potential candidate for mediation.</p>
<p>Mediational analyses were performed to determine whether the effect of SDO on rule endorsement could be explained by complementary stereotypes (Warmth × Competence interaction) controlling for the main effects of warmth and competence. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212444454">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref>, the indirect effect of SDO on the dependent variable was computed from unstandardized regression weights with 5,000 bootstrap resamples. Bootstrapping analyses confirmed that the indirect effect of SDO on rule endorsement via complementary stereotypes was significant (<italic>IE</italic> = −.06, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, BCa 95% CI = [−.19, −.004]).</p>
<p>In other words, the perception that the David groups are relatively warmer and less competent compared with the Goliath groups plays a role in endorsement of the David and Goliath rule. Consistent with the prediction that SDO would have an indirect effect on rule endorsement, the effect of SDO on rule endorsement was mediated through this complementary set of stereotypes.</p>

<sec id="section26-0146167212444454">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The tendency to view David groups as less appropriate targets of criticism relative to Goliath groups was replicated. The results also show that the tendency to perceive David groups as higher in warmth than Goliath groups leads to greater endorsement of this rule <italic>but</italic> only when David groups are attributed lower competence relative to Goliath groups. This pattern is in correspondence with the prediction that David groups are protected from criticism because they are viewed as high in warmth and low in competence.</p>
<p>Further, the results demonstrate that beliefs pertaining to group-based inequality impact on the perceived normative appropriateness of group-based criticism. In line with predictions, people who more strongly endorse group-based equality (i.e., those low in SDO) are more likely to endorse the David and Goliath rule. People high in SDO are more likely to support group differentiation along status and power lines and ideologies that legitimize group inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167212444454">Pratto et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, those high in SDO are perhaps less inclined to protect groups lower in the hierarchy from critical feedback. Indeed, those high in SDO may provide accurate feedback (or even, in extreme circumstances, to exaggerate the level of critical feedback delivered to groups low in status and power in order to reinforce or rationalize the status quo).</p>
<p>There is an interesting subplot to this story. The relationship between SDO and endorsement of the David and Goliath rule was mediated through attributions of complementary stereotypes. We predicted that, when faced with stable status hierarchies, people who more strongly endorse group-based equality would be more likely to use victim enhancement strategies. Specifically, deficits in status and power are balanced out by social and emotional riches such as attributions of warmth. Results revealed those relatively lower in SDO were <italic>particularly</italic> likely to attribute labels of high warmth and low competence to groups low in status and power (or are particularly likely to attribute qualities of coldness and competence to those at the top of the status and power hierarchy). In turn, the attribution of these complementary stereotypes led to greater endorsement of the David and Goliath rule, as would be predicted by the stereotype content model.</p>

<sec id="section27-0146167212444454">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>This article reports two studies examining which groups are seen to be more or less normatively permissible to criticize, the cross-cultural (in)consistency of these effects, and the psychological mechanisms that lead people to make those decisions. Participants consistently demonstrated a tendency to label groups low in power and status as less appropriate targets of criticism relative to groups high in power and status. This tendency—which is consistent with previous research on the norm to be kind and noblesse oblige in interpersonal contexts—was coined the David and Goliath rule. A cross-cultural difference was also demonstrated: This rule appears to be endorsed in Western cultures much more so than in Chinese cultures (Study 1). Chinese cultures were more likely than Western cultures to endorse the belief that differences in power and status are acceptable and the natural order. These differences in power distance help to explain why Chinese cultures endorse the David and Goliath rule to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>Study 2 highlighted the psychological underpinnings of the David and Goliath effect in a Western context. Results support the argument that people lower in SDO are more likely to use victim enhancement strategies such as complementary stereotypes when faced with status hierarchies. The combination of high warmth and low competence that low-SDO people attribute to groups low in status and power leads to a stronger norm to protect David groups from criticism relative to Goliath groups. This finding resonates with the paternalistic prejudice noted by Fiske and colleagues (2002) with groups viewed as warm yet incompetent being met with more protective behaviors. Another way of expressing the same effect is that those low in SDO were more likely to attribute qualities of coldness and competence to Goliath groups, which led to a stronger normative willingness to express criticism of Goliath groups.</p>
<sec id="section28-0146167212444454">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>Some limitations with regard to the measurement of the dependent variable should be acknowledged. For example, we measured willingness to criticize various groups (i.e., an anticipated behavior) as opposed to actual behavior. Furthermore, in supplying criticism appropriateness ratings, participants were asked to “indicate the extent to which they felt it was appropriate to criticize these groups.” When deciding whether it is appropriate to deliver criticism, many considerations arise that were not teased apart; for example, who is going to receive the criticism (e.g., the David or Goliath groups or a third party)? In what context do the criticisms arise (e.g., occupational, social, public or private setting)? In what interpersonal context do the criticisms arise (e.g., relevant or not relevant to the participant’s own agendas)? This level of specificity was beyond the scope of the current investigation. A fruitful avenue for future research would be to identify additional moderating conditions of the David and Goliath effect.</p>
<p>The results of Study 1 indicate how willingness to criticize groups is shaped by cultural differences. In doing so, we compared Western and Chinese cultures using the value dimension of power distance. In future, however, there may be benefits in examining other cross-cultural dimensions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212444454">Hofstede (2001)</xref> categorized cultures on a dimension of masculinity (characterized by an emphasis on achievement and competitiveness) and femininity (characterized by an emphasis on relationships and nurturing; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167212444454">van den Bos et al., 2010</xref>, for a recent examination). It could be argued theoretically that more masculine cultures (with their emphasis on ambition, competence, and the acquisition of wealth) may be more willing to criticize those with relatively low power, competence, and wealth compared with more feminine cultures, where there is more of a focus on sympathy for the unfortunate. The cultural groups examined in the current studies are all relatively high on the masculine value dimension (average rank for the Chinese cultures is 61.5; for the Western cultures 63) and so a comparison on this dimension is not possible with the current data set. Therefore, examining the masculinity–femininity distinction—and unpicking its cross-cultural effect from those of power distance—should be a focus for future research.</p>

<title>(Ironic) Implications of the David and Goliath Rule</title>
<p>This article provides evidence that some groups are normatively protected from criticism. We argue that there may, ironically, be negative consequences of this protection. Although hearing critical comments can be threatening and even painful, at times groups need to receive feedback in a raw and honest form in order to grow and develop. Although protected groups in the short term are buffered emotionally and psychologically against negativity, they are not forced to acknowledge weaknesses. Ultimately this has the potential to hinder long-term growth as a collective.</p>
<p>In line with this, research indicates that people and groups can be suspicious about the absence of negative feedback or presence of positive feedback. People often attribute both negative and positive feedback to evaluator prejudice rather than to their own performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167212444454">Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212444454">Crocker, Voelkl, Testa, &amp; Major, 1991</xref>). Indeed, Black students who received praise from Whites who supposedly knew of their racial identity reported more depressed self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212444454">Crocker et al., 1991</xref>). Self-verification theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167212444454">Swann, 1987</xref>) assumes that people work to confirm their firmly held self-conceptions and want others to see them as they see themselves. As such, the extent to which feedback deviates from expectations affects responses to feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167212444454">Swann, 1990</xref>). Recent work has established that self-verification strivings transcend the self–other barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212444454">Gomez, Seyle, Huici, &amp; Swann, 2009</xref>). People actively work to verify qualities of their ingroups (e.g., we are tardy) even when they do not themselves possess these qualities (e.g., I am conscientious; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212444454">Gomez et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This presents an interesting theoretical question: If overly positive feedback can be attributed to prejudice by the David groups, they will not actually welcome this positive feedback and receive the short-term buffering effects. In this vein, research has found that Black students receiving assumptive help on an intelligence test from a White student reported lower competence-based self-esteem and more depressed affect than White students who received assumptive help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167212444454">Schneider, Major, Luhtanen, &amp; Crocker, 1996</xref>). Although this research focuses on individual feedback, it is plausible that a similar process could occur at the group level: If David groups are aware that people are sugarcoating feedback to them or simply will not criticize them out of a desire to protect them, it might lead to low collective self-esteem on the competency dimension. In sum, although the David and Goliath effect appears to be motivated by a well-meaning desire to obscure or minimize hierarchical differences between groups, such a strategy might inadvertently cause more harm than good.</p>

<p>Those high in power distance and those high in SDO are theoretically more comfortable with the maintenance of power and status differences than those who report to be low on these dimensions. For this reason, SDO and power distance are predicted to have similar effects on endorsement of the David and Goliath rule, in that those who are comfortable with hierarchical differences should have less of a need to endorse the rule. It should be noted, though, that the two constructs are not identical. For example, power distance relates more to attitudes toward interpersonal hierarchies, whereas SDO refers more to intergroup hierarchies. Another difference is that, although both constructs can be measured at the individual level, power distance is traditionally interpreted as a cultural-level variable, whereas SDO is traditionally interpreted as an individual difference variable. It is for this reason that power distance was posited as the psychological mediator of the cross-cultural differences in Study 1, whereas SDO was used to assess underlying processes in the intracultural analysis in Study 2.</p>

It did, however, load more cleanly on the low-power factor, and the effects reported are robust with or without the inclusion of this target group. Therefore, the category of “rural people” is included among the David groups.</p>

<p>Feedback on an earlier draft of the article suggested that it would be informative to measure people’s reactions to neutral groups (i.e., groups that are neither Goliath nor David groups). In response to this, we reanalyzed the Study 2 data set to find groups that fell on or near the midpoint on the scales of power and status. We combined power and status ratings for each of the groups in Study 2 to create a single measure of power/status. The groups were then separated into three categories: David groups (<italic>M</italic> = 3.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.47), neutral groups (<italic>M</italic> = 4.79, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.19), and Goliath groups (<italic>M</italic> = 6.64, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.34). As we would predict, the criticism appropriateness ratings varied across each of the three groups, <italic>F</italic>(2, 412) = 94.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Specifically, David groups were less appropriate targets of criticism (<italic>M</italic> = 4.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.05) compared with the neutral groups (<italic>M</italic> = 5.02, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.99), which in turn were less appropriate targets of criticism than Goliath groups (<italic>M</italic> = 5.67, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.20).</p>
