<abstract>
<p>Cell saver blood is used within the peri-operative setting of cardiothoracic surgery to reduce the need for transfusion of allogenic blood products. Several meta-analyses have proven a significant decrease in allogenic transfusion with the use of cell salvage techniques. Washing of red cells by the cell saver and subsequent transfusion of suspended red cells can occasionally cause coagulopathy, particularly when using high concentration heparin saline to wash the spilled blood. We present the case of a 74-year-old female who underwent complicated aortic surgery and was transfused large volumes of cell-saved blood due to post-operative bleeding, which subsequently led to coagulopathy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell saver blood is a useful adjunct in the peri-operative period following major cardiac surgery to reduce allogenic blood transfusion. Multiple randomised controlled trials have proven the effect of cell salvage in reducing transfusion requirements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111420322">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111420322">3</xref></sup>. In our practice, processing of spilled blood during the cell salvage process involves the collection of blood and mixing with heparinised saline to prevent thrombogenesis, centrifugation of the cells, followed by saline washing prior to re-transfusion to the patient. It is well known that, as this process depletes platelets and coagulation factors, processing large volumes of cell saver blood may result in depletion coagulopathy. Cell salvage via drains in the post-operative period of orthopaedic surgery has also been demonstrated to be beneficial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111420322">4</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Case report</title>
<p>A 74-year-old woman presented with a six-month history of New York Heart association (NYHA) class III symptoms of dyspnoea. She had a past medical history of angina, emphysema, oesophageal diverticulum and sigmoid diverticulosis. Computerised tomography (CT) of the chest revealed the ascending aorta to measure 7.5cm, tapering to 5.4cm at the arch, producing compression of the main pulmonary artery, which was believed to be mainly responsible for her symptoms. Echocardiography showed good left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55%, an eccentric jet of moderate aortic regurgitation and mild left ventricular hypertrophy. She underwent aortic valve replacement and replacement of the ascending thoracic aorta, arch of aorta and proximal descending thoracic aorta. This was complicated by excessive bleeding from intercostal veins in the posterior mediastinum, as well as into her left lung parenchyma. Whilst weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass, oxygen saturations dropped dramatically which necessitated institution of central extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to maintain adequate oxygenation. Once returned to the intensive care unit with an open thoracic cavity, she bled excessively and was, therefore, attached to a cell saver (Fresenius Continuous Auto Transfusion System, Terumo Medical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The cell saver drains were flushed with heparinised saline containing 50,000 IU of heparin in 1 litre of 0.9% saline at a rate of 100 ml per hour as per the standard protocol practised during the time at our institution. As the patient was bleeding excessively and was coagulopathic with elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), we did not use any anticoagulants for ECMO. At no point during the post-operative period did the cell saver reservoir clot off. The washing programme used in the cell saver involved a 5:1 ratio between the saline wash and blood.</p>
<p>Continued efforts were made to correct her grossly abnormal coagulation profile with packed red cells, platelet bags, fresh frozen plasma, multiple units of prothrombin complex concentrate (Beriplex, CSL Behring UK Limited, Haywards Heath, UK), cryoprecipitate, fibrinogen concentrate and, finally, Novo-Seven, in addition to transfusion of autologous cell saver blood. The patient lost in excess of 18 litres of blood through her chest drains in the first 24 hours following surgery despite surgical re-explorations to find the source of bleeding and successfully control the surgical source of bleeding. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659111420322">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659111420322">Table 1</xref>, the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) remained out of range despite multiple attempts to correct all other factors that might have contributed to the coagulopathy.</p>

<p>We generally use a thrombin time prolongation of &gt;25 seconds as an indication of heparin overhang after CPB. Despite the thrombin time (TT) being 19.9 seconds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659111420322">Table 1</xref>) a thromboelastogram (TEG) with and without heparinase suggested significant heparin overhang. Therefore, a blood sample from the patient was sent for detailed assay which revealed low levels of all clotting factors, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267659111420322">Table 2</xref>, thought to be due to the dilutional effect of massive transfusion. However, no heparin was detected in the sample using the anti-Xa assay that would account for the coagulopathy. It was hypothesised that low antithrombin levels were preventing the detection of heparin within the sample, which was confirmed upon addition of human antithrombin to the sample, resulting in elevated levels of heparin being demonstrated. This effect on clotting was approximately the effect expected following administration of a prophylactic dose of enoxaparin. The use of Dade®Hepzyme® (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products, Marburg, Germany) to reverse this heparin effect in vitro resulted in a significant reduction in the APTT, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659111420322">Table 1</xref>, and partial correction of the coagulopathy. Following this, the cell saver was disconnected from the patient and an appropriate dose of protamine administered, which successfully corrected the APTT. The chest was left open while the patient was on the cell saver. Despite our continued efforts, the patient continued to deteriorate and, unfortunately, died 12 days after the initial surgery due to multi-organ failure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As mentioned before, cell salvage during and in the immediate post-operative period after major cardiac surgery is considered beneficial in reducing blood product usage. In our hospital, cell salvage is used routinely during major aortic surgery. In this particular instance, the patient, unfortunately, suffered from surgical site bleeding in the early postoperative period. The surgical source of bleeding was surgically explored and managed. However, following massive transfusion, extremes of haemodilution render the assays normally used to guide protamine reversal after cardiac surgery useless to detect residual heparin. While heparin contamination was contributory it was not the sole cause of the coagulopathic bleeding at this point in time. Timely reversal of heparin in such cases may reduce further excessive blood loss. We wish to discuss this case to highlight the importance of heparin-induced bleeding that can be overlooked in these situations.</p>
<p>Conventionally, heparinised saline is used to flush the mediastinal drains while connected to the cell saver system. After processing the spilled blood by the system, the red cell suspension that is transfused back to the patient may contain about 0.002% of the pre-wash heparin used to flush the mediastinal drains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111420322">5</xref></sup>. The dose of heparin administered will vary dependent on the drip rate and the degree of washing performed by the cell saver. Therefore, it is only logical to assume that this amount of heparin will become significant if the volume of blood washed, and consequently the amount of heparinised saline used to wash it, increases.</p>
<p>Massive post-CPB bleeding poses limitations on the filters within the collection reservoir. These filters are prone to blockage by thrombi generated by the cumulative action of protamine, haemostatic and anti-fibrinolytic agents like tranexamic acid, fresh frozen plasma and platelet infusions. An infusion into the chest drains of 50,000 units of heparin in 1L of 0.9% NaCl, infused at 100ml/hr, became standard practice to prevent the reservoir from clotting. Routine heparin assays in the washed red cell return, though scientifically ideal, is practically not possible, hence, cannot be considered in routine clinical practice. The solution to this specific problem would be to either reduce the concentration of heparin in the heparinised saline used for flushing the chest drains or to administer an appropriate dose of protamine dependent on the volume of washed red cells returned. The second option would involve developing a nomogram to estimate the amount of heparin in the packed red cell return, depending on its volume and the volume and heparin concentration of the mediastinal drain flush solution. As we found this cumbersome, we are now practising the option of reducing the amount of heparin in the chest drain flush solution from 50,000 IU/L to 30,000 IU/L at a rate of 100 ml/hour.</p>
<p>As we have demonstrated in this case report and is well documented in the literature, secondary clotting factor deficiency follows massive bleeding and subsequent massive blood transfusion. In this case it was complicated further by worsening post-cardiac surgical bleeding. Repeated return of washed red cells and residual heparin from the cell saver can worsen the coagulopathy. Clinicians should have a low threshold to consider additional doses of protamine, as suggested by the APTT values as demonstrated in this situation.</p>
