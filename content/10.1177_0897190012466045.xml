         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder that is characterized by airway inflammation, hyperresponsive airways, bronchoconstriction, and airway obstruction. These can be brought about by stimuli such as exercise, exposure to allergens, or respiratory tract infections. It is a highly variable disease both in the frequency and in the severity of the episodes within a single patient as well as in the variability of the symptoms compared to other patients with the disease. Symptoms include tightness in the chest, wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, and increased production of sputum. A diagnosis of asthma is confirmed based on the presence of one or more of the following: episodic symptoms of airflow obstruction or airway hyperresponsiveness, airflow obstructions that are at least partially reversible, and exclusion of other respiratory. The recommended methods to establish the diagnosis are a detailed medical history, physical examination, spirometry, and any other studies needed to exclude alternate diagnoses.<sup>

            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>According to a 2007 study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), approximately 34 million people were diagnosed with asthma; moreover, asthma accounted for more than 3000 deaths that year alone.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012466045">2</xref>
            </sup> In order to control and prevent asthma symptoms as well as improve the patient’s quality of life, pharmacological therapy is employed. The high prevalence of asthma garners a response by schools of pharmacy to include asthma education in the curriculum. Pharmacists are in a unique role, regardless of whether they practice in a community, hospital, or clinic setting, to provide valuable patient education regarding the use of asthma equipment and medications. When dealing with simple and complex equipment, patients require education. Demonstration of equipment is far superior to simple handouts when it comes to a patient’s understanding of how to administer their medications correctly.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012466045">3</xref>
            </sup> A pharmacist educating patients on their asthma medications and devices can substantially reduce the frequency of visits to health care facilities and therefore the cost to the health care system.<sup>

            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>South University School of Pharmacy (SUSOP) is dedicated to educating future pharmacists to care for asthmatic patients. First-year pharmacy students at SUSOP are enrolled in the Integrated Pharmacy Skills Lab (IPSL) for the first four quarters of pharmacy school. In the IPSL, the first-year pharmacy student is given the opportunity to apply concepts learned in the classroom to a practice-related setting. Laboratory topics include an introduction to community pharmacy, hospital pharmacy, and disease-based clinic pharmacy. During each of these modules, asthma management is presented in a variety of ways.</p>

      <sec id="section2-0897190012466045">
         <title>Background</title>
         <p>Pharmacists are one of the most accessible health care providers available in the community. This allows them an excellent opportunity to provide patients with asthma a management program to improve patient outcomes. Several studies have indicated that pharmacist interventions are effective in helping patients achieve and maintain asthma control.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012466045">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012466045">6</xref>
            </sup> One of the first randomized studies to demonstrate the success of asthma self-management advice by a community pharmacist was published by Barbanel et al.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012466045">5</xref>
            </sup> The study reported a significant improvement in asthma control for the intervention group verses the control group. At the onset of this study, participants completed the North of England asthma symptoms scale, a validated instrument used to measure asthma-related health status. Participants in the intervention group then received specific asthma-related education from the pharmacist, including proper inhaler technique, avoidance of asthma triggers, and self-monitoring techniques. Participants in the intervention group received weekly follow-up phone calls from a pharmacist. After 3 months, all participants returned to complete the North of England symptoms questionnaire. According to the results of the questionnaire, participants in the intervention group obtained a significant improvement in mean scores indicating better control.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012466045">5</xref>
            </sup> In addition, a study published in 2007 by Armour et al recognized that over the 6-month study, pharmacist interventions improved asthma severity, adherence to preventer medication, quality of life, asthma knowledge, and inhaler technique.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012466045">6</xref>
            </sup> Pharmacists are capable of providing asthmatic patients with management programs that will improve patient outcomes, making education of future pharmacists in asthma management vital.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section3-0897190012466045">
         <title>Education Overview</title>
         <p>The pharmacists’ role in community-based asthma management is presented to the SUSOP students throughout the IPSL series. This is accomplished in a variety of activities encompassing the use of inhalers, peak flow meters, and nebulizers. Students must first differentiate between a metered dose inhaler (MDI) and a dry powder inhaler (DPI), and the respective agent for each type of inhaler. Furthermore, students must be able to explain how to properly use these inhalers as well as peak flow meters. For example, students determine their own peak expiratory flow by demonstrating the use of a peak flow meter. A patient case then follows, allowing them to calculate the patient’s 3 peak flow zones based on their personal best. Students are asked to correctly advise the “patient” on the management of their asthma symptoms based on their calculated peak flow zone. Proper use of nebulizers is also covered within the IPSL. Multiple nebulizers are available during the laboratory session. Once the students feel proficient in operating a nebulizer, a faculty member evaluates their technique. As with MDI, students must demonstrate knowledge of medications administered via nebulization. Learning how to properly educate a patient on the use of an inhaler, a peak flow meter, and a nebulizer helps prepare the future pharmacist for the asthmatic patients in the community.</p>
         <p>Since asthmatic patients are considered high risk for respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia, these patients would benefit from the polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) as per CDC recommendations.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012466045">7</xref>
            </sup> Therefore, the APHA immunization certificate program was integrated into the course. Students are required to learn about the different vaccines, injection techniques, and immunization schedules. In teaching our students the correct techniques and schedules, they are able to offer their patients the invaluable resource of having their pharmacist be able to give them their immunizations in an often friendly, nonthreating environment.</p>
         <p>In order to facilitate hospital-based asthma education, the IPSL teaches students to interpret asthma-related physician orders, use references to obtain proper dosing of asthma medications, understand spirometry results, prepare an intravenous asthma medication, and discuss an asthma management plan upon patient discharge. Visits to emergency rooms and hospitalizations are adverse outcomes for asthmatic patients. In 2007, there were 1.75 million emergency room visits and almost half a million asthma hospitalizations.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012466045">8</xref>
            </sup> During the IPSL series, the students gain experience in a variety of skills, culminating in the fourth quarter when the students are given a hospital pharmacy-based exercise. In the first exercise, the patient AB with a severe asthma attack is a 27-year-old female that is first seen in the emergency room. In addition to interpreting the patient chart, students must evaluate a physician’s order for AB. The physician’s order is for albuterol with ipratropium per pharmacy dosing via nebulization and oral prednisone. The student must use available references to determine the proper doses for the prescribed medications and then accurately interpret the order for the nebulization. Next students are given additional information from AB’s respiratory therapist including the results of various pulmonary function tests and interpret the results by comparing them to established reference values. The students discover declining pulmonary function and are given additional tests including a chest x-ray which indicates bilateral pneumonia. Due to her impending respiratory failure, AB’s physician prescribes intravenous aminophylline requiring students to prepare an intravenous dose under instructor observation, evaluating proper aseptic technique. The case progresses through AB’s hospitalization and upon discharge from the hospital students are required to counsel on her asthma management plan and discharge medications including both an MDI and a DPI.</p>

      <sec id="section4-0897190012466045">
         <title>Summary</title>
         <p>Asthma accounts for more than $30 billion in health care costs per year in the United States.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012466045">9</xref>
            </sup> With the escalating cost of health insurance, many patients are choosing more affordable options such as health care clinics to help manage their health care needs. In the IPSL series, students are given scenarios that mimic health care clinic settings. They must understand the basic pathophysiology of asthma as well as the symptomatic presentation of a patient with asthma. In the asthma scenario, the student is presented with a patient case that allows them to follow an asthmatic patient from registration to discharge. Initially the student must gather pertinent information from a written patient history and physical. Based on the patient-specific information, the student determines which asthma medication and or device is most appropriate for that patient. Using the Georgia Board of Pharmacy laws and regulations regarding patient counseling, the student is required to counsel the patient on the asthma medication and or asthma device. Students also include information to the patient regarding possible asthma triggers and nonpharmacologic options to minimize asthma attacks such as removing household allergens. The ISPL series allows students the opportunity to experience a scenario similar to a health care clinic helping to prepare them to identify asthmatic patients, choose appropriate asthma medications and or asthma devices and counsel asthma patients.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Teaching asthma education to our students at SUSOP is a priority in the curriculum. Recent studies have proven that targeted asthma education by pharmacists is having a positive impact on the lives of asthma patients. Such impacts include decreasing asthma symptoms, reducing emergency room visits and hospitalizations, improving inhaler technique, and reducing missed school/work days.<sup>
