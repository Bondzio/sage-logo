<sec id="sec1-1754045313487719" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>This review provides a summary of sex differences in diabetes epidemiology and covers specific aspects of the life-course in women.</p>
<p>There are estimated to be over 170 million people in the world with diabetes and more than half of them are women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754045313487719">1</xref></sup> This pattern reflects the predominance of older women in the world and the importance of age as a risk factor for diabetes. Throughout the life course of populations of European ancestry, diabetes has a higher age-specific prevalence in men than women. Type 1 diabetes is typically diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood (autoimmune aetiology) with a peak prevalence in middle age. Conversely, type 2 diabetes is a disease of older adults, secondary mainly to the development of insulin resistance, frequently in association with obesity, with the prevalence rising though adulthood and peaking in the 8th decade in developed countries such as Scotland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754045313487719">Figure 1</xref>). Some of the difference in risk of diabetes between men and women is likely to be related to the fat distribution within the body. Men typically store fat as visceral fat and women subcutaneously. A recent study using Scottish data found that men develop diabetes at a lower body mass index (BMI) than do women,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754045313487719">2</xref></sup> reflecting the suggested hypothesis of fat distribution.
<fig id="fig1-1754045313487719" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Prevalence of diabetes by age and sex in Scotland.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1754045313487719-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Across the world, the prevalence of diabetes is rising over time, driven in the main by the rise in incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but also by increasing survival of people with diabetes. In 2010, 237,768 people in Scotland were known to have a diagnosis of diabetes (4.6%), with the majority (87.7%) having type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754045313487719">3</xref></sup> Prevalence of diabetes is lower amongst women than men (3.8% vs 5.0%) in Scotland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754045313487719">4</xref></sup> The absolute rate of increase of numbers of people with diabetes is approximately 0.2% per year in Scotland, and has been consistent over the past 5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754045313487719">3</xref></sup> This is thought to reflect a real increase in the prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The main driver is type 2 diabetes, brought about by a number of factors including: our aging population, the rise in obesity and the decline in physical activity.</p>
<p>Risk factors for type 2 diabetes are related to both lifestyle and genetic background. Beyond increasing age, additional established risk factors include: obesity; being of Black, South Asian or other of non-European ancestry and having a family history of diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes increases with deprivation and this effect is more marked in women than in men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754045313487719">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1754045313487719"><title>Puberty and the menarche</title>
<p>Prior to pregnancy, it is acknowledged that insulin and growth hormone levels have an effect on oogenesis. Diabetes is associated with delayed oocyte maturation and less frequent ovulation. There is also impaired meiotic maturation of the follicle and potential impaired follicular development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754045313487719">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dorman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754045313487719">7</xref></sup> found an older age at menarche (13.5 years vs 12.6 years, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and an increased rate of menstrual irregularities (45.7% vs 33.1%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04) in women with type 1 diabetes compared with women without diabetes. However, this finding may be influenced by the higher BMI in non-diabetic women in the study (24.6 vs 27.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). Ahmed found that whilst puberty was not delayed in children with type 1 diabetes, the associated growth spurt was stunted in girls compared to boys with diabetes and that this was closely associated with diabetes control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1754045313487719">8</xref></sup> Other difficulties encountered in girls with diabetes during puberty include excessive weight gain and weight loss difficulties,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754045313487719">9</xref></sup> more difficult glucose control and issues with maintaining patients’ ownership of diabetes management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1754045313487719">10</xref></sup> compared to boys.</p>
<p>Longer and irregular menstrual cycles have been associated with later type 2 diabetes in a number of studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1754045313487719">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1754045313487719">12</xref></sup> A linear association was found between the age at menarche and type 2 diabetes in the EPIC-Norfolk study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1754045313487719">13</xref></sup> with an odds ratio of 0.91 (0.87–0.96) for each additional year at menarche, when prevalent and incident cases were studied together. However, this association was completely attenuated when adjusted for BMI at age 40 to 75 years, with a resulting odds ratio of 0.98 (0.93–1.03). Data from the American Nurses Health Study and the Nurses Health Study II showed similar results,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1754045313487719">14</xref></sup> even after adjusting for BMI at age 18 years. However, the risk was greatly attenuated after adjusting for time-varying BMI before incident diabetes. Similar results were seen in the British Birth Cohort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1754045313487719">15</xref></sup> As early menarche is associated with a risk of later adiposity, this group of women might benefit from special attention for the prevention of diabetes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1754045313487719"><title>Diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome</title>
<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been described as the most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age as symptoms are present in 5–10% of women of this age group. PCOS is associated with oligomenorrhoea, hirsutism, acne, reduced fertility, elevated androgen levels and insulin resistance to varying degrees among different women. Although PCOS is frequently associated with obesity and obesity is associated with more severe symptoms, PCOS is associated with insulin resistance even among women who are not obese. The aetiology is unknown and may involve genetic components. The odds of having type 2 diabetes was estimated to be approximately four-fold higher in women with PCOS than women without PCOS regardless of whether attempts were made to match for BMI in a systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1754045313487719">16</xref></sup> Improvement in gynaecological and metabolic features of PCOS can be achieved with a healthy lifestyle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754045313487719">17</xref></sup> Although drugs that improve insulin sensitivity such as metformin and thiazolidinediones offer potential treatments for PCOS, there is limited trial evidence of benefit in terms of pregnancy or metabolic outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1754045313487719">18</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1754045313487719"><title>Pregnancy</title>
<p>Until recently, the majority of pregnancies among women with diabetes occurred in women with type 1 diabetes; however, the increasing prevalence of obesity has been associated with an increasing incidence of both type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes in younger women. As many women are delaying pregnancy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1754045313487719">19</xref></sup> more pregnancies in women with type 2 diabetes are being seen.</p>
<p>Further, fecundability (ability to conceive) has been reported to be lower for mothers with diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1754045313487719">20</xref></sup> with odds ratios for conception within a given menstrual cycle, in comparison to women without diabetes, of 0.76 (0.61–0.89) for type 1 diabetes and 0.64 (0.48–0.84) for type 2 diabetes, after adjustment for maternal age and pre-pregnancy BMI.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1754045313487719"><title>Effect of pregnancy on pre-existing diabetes</title>
<p>Pregnancy leads to increased insulin resistance and is associated with a higher frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes (and reduced hypoglycaemia awareness) in women with type 1 diabetes. This is exacerbated by potentially poorer glycaemic control due to the nausea and vomiting associated with early pregnancy. There is also evidence for the advancement of retinopathy during pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1754045313487719">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754045313487719">22</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1754045313487719"><title>Gestational diabetes</title>
<p>Gestational diabetes is the term used to describe hyperglycaemia that is first identified during pregnancy and it affects about 3–10% of pregnancies depending on the population studied and the diagnostic criteria that are used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1754045313487719">23</xref></sup> A key factor appears to be increased insulin resistance during pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include maternal age (risks are particularly high for women over 35 years of age), Asian ethnicity, obesity, personal or family history of gestational diabetes/a baby with macrosomia or type 2 diabetes. Consequences of gestational diabetes for the baby are similar to those for type 2 diabetes during pregnancy and are discussed further below. Women who develop gestational diabetes are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes subsequently and lifestyle intervention is the most appropriate approach for reducing subsequent risk of diabetes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1754045313487719"><title>Effect of diabetes on pregnancy</title>
<p>Women with both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of adverse outcomes of pregnancy including miscarriage, congenital malformations and neonatal death compared to women without diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1754045313487719">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1754045313487719"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1754045313487719"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1754045313487719">27</xref></sup> During the first trimester of pregnancy, the elevated glucose is thought to be teratogenic, via the generation of reactive oxygen species and modifying apoptosis regulation genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1754045313487719">24</xref></sup> In a study of women with type 1 diabetes, the relative risk for congenital malformations also increased with increasing HbA1c compared to non-diabetic women (HbA1c &lt; 5.6% relative risk 1.6; 5.6–6.8% RR 3.0; 6.9–8.0% RR2.3; 8.1–9.3% RR 3.3 and ≥9.4% RR 4.8).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1754045313487719">25</xref></sup> A recent systematic review found that women with diabetes had a similar congenital malformation rate to women without diabetes, when their diabetes was controlled (2%) but with every 1SD increase above the mean non-diabetic HbA1c, the risk of congenital malformations increased with an odds ratio of 1.2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1754045313487719">26</xref></sup> This increased risk was reaffirmed in the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland 2002/2003, where the rate in mothers with diabetes was nearly double that of women without diabetes (41.8 congenital anomalies/1000 total births vs 21.0/1000), with the main malformations recorded as heart, limb, nervous system and genitourinary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1754045313487719">27</xref></sup> In the second trimester, a further fetal risk for mothers with diabetes is macrosomia secondary to maternal hyperglycaemia, causing fetal hyperinsulinaemia and increased growth. In the final trimester, there are higher risks of birth injury, fetal hypoxia and stillbirth to women with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. Adverse pregnancy outcomes are significantly higher in diabetes than in women without diabetes. The CEMACH determined the following mortality rates: stillbirth type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) 25.8, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 29.2, non-diabetic mothers 5.7; perinatal mortality T1DM 31.7, T2DM 32.3, non-diabetic mothers 8.5 and neonatal deaths T1DM 9.6, T2DM 9.5, non-diabetic mothers 3.6 (all per 1000 births).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1754045313487719">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are also implications for medication use during pregnancy in women with diabetes. Short-acting insulins have been extensively studied in pregnancy and are considered to be a safe and effective way of managing blood glucose during this period. Whilst insulin is the essential treatment of type 1 diabetes during pregnancy, it is now more commonly used in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes. In addition, some long-acting insulins (e.g. neutral protamine Hagedorn) have also been used safely for many years. Given the increasing numbers of pregnant women with type 2 diabetes, the use of metformin in pregnancy has become more common. This is considered safe during the first trimester of pregnancy, with patients frequently being changed to insulin therapy in the later stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1754045313487719">28</xref></sup> Metformin does cross the placenta and early studies (until the age of 2 years) suggest no adverse effects on the child.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1754045313487719">29</xref></sup> Glibenclamide is also considered safe (it does not cross the placenta and does not appear to be teratogenic); however, long-acting insulin analogues and other oral hypoglycaemic agents are currently not approved for use in pregnancy in Europe or the United States, mainly based on a lack of evidence confirming safety (as opposed to significant evidence of adverse effects). There is yet to be significant evidence of the effectiveness of insulin pump use in pregnancy, compared to conventional insulin therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1754045313487719">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1754045313487719">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is not just the glucose lowering treatments that may need to be modified. Older patients with type 2 diabetes, above the typical reproductive age, are often treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and statins, both of which are contraindicated in pregnancy. Again, the trend of developing type 2 diabetes at an earlier age, and of women becoming pregnant later in life, may result in treatment with these drugs prior to pregnancy becoming more common. Blood pressure control is a further issue, as hypertension is frequently associated with type 2 diabetes, with methyldopa the drug of choice in pregnancy.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1754045313487719"><title>Menopause and hormone replacement therapy</title>
<sec id="sec9-1754045313487719"><title>Menopause</title>
<p>The menopause is signified by the last menstrual period and biologically reflects ovarian failure and estrogen deficiency. Typical symptoms in the peri-menopausal period include vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and sweating), vaginal dryness, urinary incontinence and sleep disturbance. The experience of these symptoms in women with diabetes has not been formally investigated in any detail. There is also some overlap between symptoms of the menopause and the experience of hypoglycaemia and diabetic autonomic neuropathy.</p>
<p>In 2001, Dorman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754045313487719">7</xref></sup> studied the transition of the menopause in 143 women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and found the mean age of menopause to be younger amongst women with diabetes compared to those without (41.6 years vs 48.0 years, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05). A decade later, a similar study on over 1000 women with T1DM in Finland found no difference in the age of menopause compared with the national average (52.5years vs 51.0 years).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1754045313487719">32</xref></sup> There is a paucity of data on the age at menopause amongst women with T1DM. If the first study is to be believed, the combination of a later menarche and earlier menopause means diabetic women have approximately six fertile years fewer than non-diabetic women.</p>
<p>Similarly, the age at menopause in type 2 diabetes is not clear. A Mexican study of menopausal women aged 45–72 years suggested that it may occur earlier than in women without diabetes (mean age 46 years vs 48 years, NS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1754045313487719">33</xref></sup> In a cross-sectional study in a population of women 45 to 55 years, type 2 diabetes was not associated with a difference in age at menopause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1754045313487719">34</xref></sup> In the women in the Diabetes Prevention Program, who had a high risk for diabetes, a natural menopause did not increase the risk for diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1754045313487719">35</xref></sup> All of the above studies were small, and so not powered to answer this question. Among the 3691 postmenopausal women in the EPIC-InterAct study, those who were younger at menopause had a higher risk of incident diabetes, with a fully adjusted standardised hazards ratio of 1.08 (1.02–1.12);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1754045313487719">36</xref></sup> further, a shorter reproductive life span was also associated with a higher diabetes risk, with hazards ratio 1.06 (1.01–1.12). Whether menopause is earlier in women who already have type 2 diabetes has not been studied to our knowledge, but this may be possible in the future, with the trend for younger women to have type 2 diabetes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1754045313487719"><title>Hormone replacement therapy</title>
<p>Estrogen-containing treatment is the mainstay of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for postmenopausal women. It is supplemented with progestogen in those women with a uterus, where unopposed estrogen therapy is associated with endometrial cancer. The key advantage of HRT is the relief of vasomotor symptoms. In addition, it is protective for osteoporosis. For the treatment of menopausal symptoms, the short-term advantages outweigh the disadvantages of increased risk of venous thromboembolism, stroke, endometrial cancer and breast cancer. Accordingly, the advice is to use the minimum effective dose for the shortest possible duration.</p>
<sec id="sec11-1754045313487719"><title>Effects in women with diabetes</title>
<p>Given the risks of both diabetes and the menopause, each case needs to be evaluated on its individual merits. Do the vasomotor and osteoporosis benefits outweigh the risks of endometrial or breast cancer?</p>
<p>A large meta-analysis found that women with diabetes taking HRT had significantly reduced insulin resistance (12.9%, 95%CI 19.8–51.7%), reduced fasting glucose (11.5%, 95%CI 5.1–18.0%) and reduced fasting insulin (20.2%, 95%CI 4.2–36.3%), compared to those taking placebo or no treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1754045313487719">37</xref></sup> However, observational studies are limited by the issue of temporality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1754045313487719"><title>Effects of HRT on glucose tolerance in women without diabetes</title>
<p>There is good evidence that HRT reduces the risk of developing diabetes in non-diabetic women. A meta-analysis of 107 randomised controlled trials found a 30% reduction in the incidence of diabetes in women taking HRT vs no treatment or placebo (relative risk 0.7, 95%CI 0.6–0.9).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1754045313487719">37</xref></sup> They also found non-diabetic users had significantly lower abdominal adiposity and waist circumference and more positive lipid profiles than non-users. Again individual women need to weigh the risks and benefits of HRT.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1754045313487719"><title>Differences in association between diabetes and other conditions</title>
<sec id="sec14-1754045313487719"><title>Cardiovascular disease</title>
<p>Diabetes is accepted as a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1754045313487719">38</xref></sup> However, how much of this risk relates directly to diabetes and how much relates to confounding factors such as obesity, blood pressure, age and lipids remains under discussion.</p>
<p>Women with diabetes have higher relative risks of cardiovascular disease than men with diabetes. However, during middle-age, men are significantly more likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease than women (absolute risk is higher). Add to this the suggested increased risk of cardiovascular disease after the menopause and the risk to postmenopausal women with diabetes, the risk of cardiovascular disease is not to be ignored. The menopause is argued to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease as estrogen is protective for cardiovascular disease and its lack is potentially damaging. However, at the same time, UK data have not shown any significant proportional increase in cardiovascular mortality at the time of the menopause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1754045313487719">39</xref></sup> In addition, Vaidya et al. have shown that for consecutive birth cohorts in both the UK and USA, lifetime cardiovascular mortality fell and that although cardiovascular morality amongst women increased exponentially throughout life, it did not show any additional increase at the time of the menopause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1754045313487719">40</xref></sup> The impact of the menopause on cardiovascular disease remains controversial.</p>
<p>There have been numerous studies investigating the relationship between cardiovascular disease and diabetes. A recent large meta-analysis based on 12 studies and nearly 700,000 participants found that relative risk of coronary heart disease was higher for women than for men (hazards ratio 2.59 vs 1.89, adjusted for age, smoking, BMI and blood pressure).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1754045313487719">41</xref></sup> In 2002, Kanaya et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1754045313487719">42</xref></sup> performed a meta-analysis specifically to examine the sex difference in cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. They included only studies adjusted for a minimum of age, blood pressure, hypercholesterolaemia and smoking (but not obesity) and found higher odds ratios of disease mortality for people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes; the odds ratios for women were higher than those for men for coronary heart disease mortality (OR 2.92 vs 2.33), non-fatal MI (OR 1.70 vs 1.55) and total cardiovascular mortality (OR 4.14 vs 3.18), but these differences were small and not statistically significant.</p>

Nicodemus et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1754045313487719">43</xref></sup> studied 306,900 person years, and after adjustment for key confounders, women with type 1 diabetes (<italic>n</italic> = 5 47) were 12.25 times (95% CI 5.05–29.73) more likely to report an incident hip fracture than women without diabetes. Results for women with type 2 diabetes were less dramatic with a 1.70 times higher risk (95% CI 1.21–2.38) of incident hip fracture. Of note, women experiencing type 2 diabetes for a longer duration and those using insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents had higher incidence rates than women without diabetes. The study also noted that those women with incident diabetes following menopause also had a higher risk of hip fracture than age-matched women without diabetes (RR 1.60, 95%CI 1.14–2.25). Bone mineral density issues in diabetes are further complicated by the recent findings that thiozolidinediones may increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. A meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1754045313487719">47</xref></sup> of 10 randomised controlled trials including over 13,000 patients found a significantly increased risk of fractures in the thiozolidinedione-treated group compared to controls (OR1.45, 95%CI 1.18–1.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). This finding was extended to examine sex differences, with an increased risk of fracture in thiozolidinedione-treated women compared to controls (OR 2.23) but not in men (OR 1.00).

<p>The risk of developing some female cancers is thought to be higher in women with diabetes. It is particularly difficult to accurately assess the impact of diabetes on older women because diabetes and some cancers have risk factors in common (e.g. increasing age, obesity) making it hard to tease out whether there is an independent effect of diabetes. Despite this, controlling for potential confounders in analyses has still found some associations between diabetes and some cancers.</p>
<p>The direct biological effect of diabetes on cancer development is not clear but is likely to be related to insulin and insulin-like growth factor pathways. In addition, there may be indirect effects through screening, presentation and treatment.</p>

<p>The increasing prevalence of diabetes in combination with an aging population and increasing female longevity means that it is important to understand the effects of diabetes on women’s health. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes influence health outcomes throughout the life-course. Type 1 diabetes appears to be associated with a delay in menarche and with menstrual irregularities. Adverse outcomes of pregnancy are associated with both types of diabetes and there is evidence to suggest that women with diabetes undergo earlier menopause than women without diabetes.</p>
<p>Diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in both men and women, with absolute risks being higher for men than women regardless of diabetes status. However, relative risks of cardiovascular disease associated with diabetes are higher for women than for men.</p>
<p>The association between diabetes and bone mineral density is complicated by multiple confounding factors such as higher weight/BMI associated with diabetes and thiazolidinedione use. The relationship between diabetes and breast cancer is inconsistent across studies, but outcomes following breast cancer are poorer in women with diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer, but there does not appear to be a marked effect of diabetes on risk of ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>Prevention of diabetes is therefore desirable and has been shown to be feasible for type 2 diabetes in several trials in different settings. Challenges remain in supporting development and maintenance of healthier lifestyles in populations living in obesogenic environments.</p>
