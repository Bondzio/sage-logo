<p>This article examines how institutional change affects age-based labour market inequalities in Europe. We focus on the impact of labour regulation and of wage-setting institutions on the male population aged 25–54. Age-graded labour market inequalities within this group of prime-age individuals are hitherto under-researched. We estimate country panel regressions using data from the European Union Labour Force Survey and time-series data on institutional change for the years 1992–2007. The results present evidence that employment protection and the regulation of temporary work affect age-based inequality dynamics, while union strength has positive employment effects on all age-groups.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years there has been an ever-growing academic interest in the impact of European labour market institutions on economic performance. In particular, research investigating the heterogeneous effects of institutions on the labour market performance of different demographic groups notably increased. Most empirical work investigating heterogeneous effects of institutions focused on the inequality dimension of skill (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020715212452285">Acemoglu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020715212452285">Daniel and Siebert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020715212452285">Maurin and Postel-Vinay, 2005</xref>). The theoretical premise of these studies, which assumes a falling demand for low-skilled labour owing to skill-biased technological change, has been challenged however (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020715212452285">Lemenieux, 2006</xref>). In their study of 15 EU-countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020715212452285">Gebel and Giesecke (2011)</xref> do not find any evidence for an increasing risk of unemployment for low-skilled workers. It can thus be argued that the sole focus on heterogeneous institutional effects for different skill groups may neglect other, more relevant, inequality dimensions, such as age. Age is a fundamental, yet under-researched dimension of labour market stratification, especially when it comes to age-based inequalities within what tends to be defined as the prime-age workforce (i.e. those aged 25–54). The transition phases within the tripartite life-course (education – economic activity – retirement) are becoming increasingly lengthy and erratic (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020715212452285">Phillipson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020715212452285">Sackmann, 2001</xref>) and there are reasons to believe that these transitions reach well into prime-age and are now an important source of inequality. Since age-groups differ substantially in their human capital and bargaining power, age clearly represents a crucial dimension of stratification. Our contribution aims at understanding the role of labour market institutions in shaping age-graded inequalities in labour market risks. We know that the experience of labour market insecurity (e.g. unemployment, involuntary inactivity, temporary work) often triggers processes of cumulative disadvantage with long-term consequences for individuals’ future lives and careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020715212452285">Booth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020715212452285">Gangl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020715212452285">Gash and McGinnity, 2007</xref>). A thorough investigation of how institutions shape age-graded labour market risks could thus offer an important contribution to sociological life-course research.</p>
<p>Our focus is on the male population aged 25–54. Excluding women, whose labour supply is more elastic throughout the life-course, allows for a more direct assessment of institutional effects on age-graded inequalities in the ‘core’ workforce. By focusing on ‘prime-age individuals’, we aim to exclude those whose labour supply is affected by institutional factors that are outside of the scope of this paper (e.g. persons above the age of 54 whose labour supply responds to the incentives set by retirement policies; and youth aged below 25 whose labour supply is shaped by the education system). This allows us to test the repercussions of labour market institutions in isolation – insofar as possible – from specific ‘linkage structures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020715212452285">Sackmann, 2001</xref>). We focus on institutions pertaining to employment protection and regulation as well as those affecting collective wage-setting, as these are often theorized to be most relevant in shaping age-graded inequalities in labour market outcomes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020715212452285">Bertola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020715212452285">Kahn, 2007</xref>). Using micro-data from the European Union Labour Force Survey (EULFS) and high quality time-series data measuring institutional change from 1992–2007, we estimate country panel regressions.</p>
<p>Our analysis extends beyond existing cross-national work concerned with institutional effects on <italic>age-graded</italic> inequalities in important ways. First, prior work tended to use the prime-age workforce (25–54) as a reference category against which younger, and sometimes also older, individuals were contrasted. We instead focus on the impact of institutions on age-graded inequalities <italic>within</italic> this group. Second, most prior work on heterogeneous institutional effects with focus on age used only cross-sectional (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020715212452285">Baranowska and Gebel, 2010</xref>), aggregate level (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020715212452285">Bassanini and Duval, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020715212452285">Bertola et al., 2007</xref>) or short time-series data. Our analysis, by contrast, uses long time-series data and focuses on institutional change, thereby circumventing some of the endogeneity problems which hamper the conclusions drawn by cross-sectional work in this area. This article is structured as follows: the next section discusses previous work, provides the theoretical background, and develops the main hypotheses. Subsequently, we present information on the data used and explain the statistical modelling. We then present and discuss our results. The final section concludes.</p>

<title>2. Theoretical background</title>
<sec id="section3-0020715212452285">
<title>2.1. Employment protection and regulation</title>
<p>The effect of strong employment protection on aggregate employment and unemployment levels is theoretically ambiguous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020715212452285">Bassanini and Duval, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020715212452285">Bertola, 1992</xref>). Overly strict protection of regular employment that comes along with <italic>high firing costs</italic> may, on the one hand, help maintain employment levels (protection of incumbent workers, i.e. labour market insiders). On the other hand, however, high firing costs will also lower employers’ incentives for hiring. This creates barriers to employment for labour market outsiders and has negative effects on unemployment outflows, thus increasing the duration of unemployment spells (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020715212452285">Kugler and Saint Paul, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As concerns age-graded labour market outcomes, neo-classical economic models predict strict employment protection to be detrimental to young individuals, who are labour market outsiders. They are overrepresented among job-seekers as they are often still in their labour market entry phase. Moreover, their productivity is difficult to assess because they have little (or no) work experience implying a higher risk of mismatch for the employer. Youth is thus held to be most adversely affected by employment protection. Also some sociologists hold the view that strong employment protection can (in certain contexts) be harmful for young people (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020715212452285">Breen, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020715212452285">1</xref></sup> Older workers, by contrast, enjoy a particularly strong protection, because they tend to be labour market insiders, who are the natural beneficiaries of stringent employment protection. Moreover, such legislation often contains tenure-related provisions and sometimes involves special penalties for firing older workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020715212452285">Chéron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020715212452285">OECD, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020715212452285">2006b</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings from empirical research on the impact of employment protection on aggregate labour market outcomes mirror the aforementioned theoretical ambivalence (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020715212452285">Skedinger, 2010</xref>, for a review of more than 100 studies on this topic). The present study is based on the expectation that age-differentiated investigations will be helpful to advance our understanding of the underlying employment dynamics. Available empirical work on the effect of employment protection for different age-groups (located <italic>outside</italic> the prime-age workforce) provides some evidence of heterogeneous effects with negative implications found for youth and positive ones for older workers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020715212452285">Bassanini and Duval, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020715212452285">Kahn, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A prevalent argument in existent work is that strict protection of regular employment increases employers’ incentives to use fixed-term contracts because high firing costs decrease the relative cost of temporary workers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020715212452285">Boockmann and Hagen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020715212452285">Pierre and Scarpetta, 2004</xref>). The attractiveness of temporary employment is affected by the level of protection of regular employment, but also by the degree of regulation of temporary contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020715212452285">Nunziata and Staffolani, 2007</xref>). Many European labour markets have implemented so-called <italic>partial reforms</italic>: while employment protection for regular jobs remains mostly unchanged and continues to be high, regulations concerning temporary work have been loosened considerably (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020715212452285">Esping-Andersen and Regini, 2000</xref>). These partial reforms are held to be the causal force behind increased inequalities in job security in a number of European countries (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020715212452285">DiPrete et al., 2006</xref>). The increased risk of temporary employment is mainly borne by young workers, because they are more affected by hiring processes than older age-groups (i.e. they are more likely to search for and enter new jobs), but also because sometimes the use of atypical contracts is only legitimate for young workers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020715212452285">Dolado et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, research with a focus on supply-side rationales shows that job insecurity can negatively affect work motivation and commitment (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020715212452285">Sverke et al., 2002</xref>). The deregulation of temporary work could thus have unintended – negative – employment effects, especially for young people. On a more optimistic note, however, partial reforms could be a means to promote job creation and reduce unemployment – especially for the younger population. This will only be the case, however, if permanent jobs are not merely replaced by temporary ones.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020715212452285">Kahn (2010)</xref> finds that the deregulation of temporary employment increases the likelihood that the employed population is in temporary jobs, but that it does not increase overall employment levels. This suggests that, rather than creating employment, deregulation of temporary work merely leads to a substitution of permanent work with temporary work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020715212452285">Nunziata and Staffolani (2007)</xref>, by contrast, find that the deregulation of fixed-term contracts increases also <italic>permanent</italic> employment levels suggesting that such contracts can function as ‘stepping-stones’. They also find, however, that the deregulation of temporary work agencies merely leads to the substitution of permanent jobs with temporary ones.</p>
<p>The theoretical expectation is that strict employment protection legislation (EPL) is beneficial for labour market insiders, because it decreases their risk of lay-off, while it is detrimental for labour market outsiders, because it reduces their chances for labour market (re-)entry. Therefore, we expect younger prime-age workers (here defined as those aged 25–29), who often do not yet have a stable foothold in the labour market, to experience mainly the detrimental impact of strict EPL (i.e. increased unemployment, inactivity or temporary work). For mid-career workers (here defined as those aged 34–44) the enhanced difficulty of re-employment due to strict EPL is expected to be offset by the reduced likelihood of job loss. Hence, we predict a zero net effect of strict EPL on their employment levels. We expect older prime-age workers (here defined as those aged 50–54), to experience a positive net effect, because the employment-maintaining effect of strict EPL is assumed to be more relevant than the reduced re-employment chance (in the event that these workers are on the job market, which is less likely than for young and mid-career workers).</p>
<sec id="section4-0020715212452285">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Following this logic, we predict that an increased strictness of EPL has negative effects for young individuals entailing rising levels of unemployment, inactivity and temporary work at the expense of regular employment (<italic>Hypothesis 1a</italic>). Conversely, strict EPL is expected to have positive effects for older workers, mainly in the form of an increased likelihood of regular employment and a decreased risk of non-employment (<italic>Hypothesis 1b</italic>). Moreover, we expect the deregulation of temporary work to increase the use of fixed-term contracts – especially in contexts where the protection of workers on regular contracts is strict (<italic>Hypothesis 2a</italic>). We further predict that deregulatory reforms primarily affect young individuals who are most likely to be job-seekers (<italic>Hypothesis 2b</italic>). The effect of deregulation of temporary work will, however, hinge on whether temporary jobs are newly created or whether they merely replace permanent jobs. A mechanism that may even decrease overall employment levels concerns the motivational effect of precarious work: if young workers increasingly receive only temporary job offers this may negatively affect their motivation to work resulting in increased rates of non-employment (<italic>Hypothesis 2c</italic>).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section5-0020715212452285">
<title>2.2. Collective wage-setting</title>
<p>According to neoclassical strands of economic theory – which is the framework most empirical work on this topic draws on – collective wage-setting institutions price certain types of worker, amongst them the low-skilled, the young and the old, out of employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020715212452285">Bertola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020715212452285">OECD, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020715212452285">2006b</xref>). Specifically, it is assumed that strong unions are conducive to wage compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020715212452285">Card et al., 2003</xref>) resulting in high wage floors. Employers may consider these to be too high for young, inexperienced workers and for older workers whose productivity is held to be on the decline. Hence proponents of this perspective expect stronger unions to result in higher aggregate non-employment and greater age-based inequalities (to the detriment of young and old workers).</p>
<p>Alternative theoretical approaches, by contrast, emphasize that strong unions can increase labour market efficiency. By promoting long durations of employment relationships and the involvement of workers in decision-making, unions are held to encourage tight employer-employee dependencies and create a climate where the workforce is willing to share their knowledge with the employer as well as other workers. Such contexts ensure continuous improvement of production processes and are thus conducive to labour market performance and high employment levels (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020715212452285">Hall, 2001</xref>). It is further argued that low wage inequality achieved by strong unions provides incentives for employers to invest <italic>equitably</italic> and <italic>sufficiently</italic> in the continuous upgrading of their workers’ skills as a means to reduce the gap between their (collectively agreed) wages and their actual productivity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020715212452285">Acemoglu and Pischke, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020715212452285">Streeck, 1992</xref>). We deem this latter (theorized) ‘union outcome’ to be particularly relevant in terms of age-graded labour market outcomes. As young workers rely on skill acquisition to develop their employability and older workers are at risk of skill depreciation, equitable access to workplace training should increase both groups’ employment rates. Because of their continuous skill investments it is rational for employers to prefer long-term employment relationships, which is why we anticipate that the aforementioned employment growth pertains to employment on open-ended contracts. Quite in contrast to what is predicted by neoclassical economic theory, we would then expect that strong unions lower the degree of age-based inequalities by improving the labour market prospects of young and old workers.</p>
<p>The impact of unions is contingent on the level of coordination, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020715212452285">Soskice, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020715212452285">Traxler and Kittel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020715212452285">OECD, 2006a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020715212452285">Calmfors and Drifill (1988)</xref> argue that highly coordinated unions – even though afforded with greater bargaining power – are more moderate in their bargaining as they consider the consequences of excessive wage claims for overall employment. Also uncoordinated wage bargaining is theorized to encourage unions to make more tempered wage demands as bargaining at firm-level has immediate employment implications for their members. At intermediate levels of coordination, by contrast, unions are held to have negative effects (hypothesis of <italic>hump-shaped</italic> coordination effects). This is because in such contexts unions’ wage bargaining is less affected by market forces and internalization of adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020715212452285">Traxler and Kittel, 2000</xref>) than that of unions which are uncoordinated or highly coordinated, respectively. Political economy scholars, by contrast, put less emphasis on market forces than on “internal stability and compromises” and suggest that unions’ policies and bargaining behaviour gets more considerate the higher the degree of coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020715212452285">Traxler and Kittel, 2000</xref>). They thus predict a positive, linear effect of coordination (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020715212452285">Streeck and Schmitter, 1985</xref>). Empirical evidence to date – albeit plentiful – is inconclusive when concerning the impact of union power on aggregate labour market performance (see overview in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020715212452285">OECD, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020715212452285">2006b</xref>). Again a focus on age-graded inequalities may be important to understand the employment dynamics of union power. Evidence on heterogeneous effects for different age-groups is still scarce.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020715212452285">2</xref></sup> Moreover, it provides no insights into the inequality dynamics within the prime-age workforce.</p>
<sec id="section6-0020715212452285">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>According to the neoclassical logic, greater union power should lead to higher rates of inactivity and unemployment amongst young and older individuals (<italic>Hypothesis 3a</italic>). Moreover, according to the hump-shape hypothesis, the strongest negative union effects should occur at medium levels of coordination (<italic>Hypothesis 3b</italic>). Based on alternative approaches that emphasize the positive effects of compressed wage structures, by contrast, we expect unions to be conducive to developing the employability of young workers and maintaining that of older workers, thus increasing their levels of regular employment (<italic>Hypothesis 3c</italic>). Moreover, from a political economy perspective, we would predict the positive effects of strong unions to increase monotonically with the level of coordination (<italic>Hypothesis 3d</italic>).</p>

<title>3. Data and methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0020715212452285">
<title>3.1. The data</title>
<p>We use <italic>cross-sectional time-series</italic> data from the EULFS for 19 countries covering up to 16 years (1992–2007, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020715212452285">Appendix Table A1</xref> for detail). These data provide standardized individual-level information on the labour market based on national labour force surveys. They are unique for the sample size they cover and the length of the time-series they provide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020715212452285">Eurostat, 2005</xref>, for detail). We include the following countries: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. As harmonized EULFS data for Germany only became available in 2002, we use the German Mikrozensus (GMZ) instead which offers a longer time-series (1995–2007). The combined data set includes a total sample of 6.8 million male individuals aged 25–54 nested within 19 countries. The micro-data are complemented by time-series data on institutional change from the OECD, the World Economic Outlook (WEO) and the ICTWSS database (for details see below).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0020715212452285">
<title>3.2. The two-step approach</title>
<p>Using the pooled cross-sectional time-series data described above, we estimate the impact of country-level institutional factors on individual labour market outcomes. Instead of estimating hierarchical linear models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020715212452285">Bryk and Raudenbush, 2002</xref>), we apply a <italic>two-step approach</italic>. This estimation technique uses estimated parameters from step-1 (i.e. individual-level) regressions as dependent variables in step-2 (i.e. in country-level regressions that regress step-1 estimates on country-level predictors).</p>
<p>Such a two-step approach performs equally well as simultaneous estimation techniques (see special issue in <italic>Political Analysis</italic> 2005, Volume 13). Under certain conditions, it is indeed superior to standard HLM models. First, the two-step approach is ideal for analysing data in which very high numbers of level-1 observations are nested within a relatively low number of level-2 observations, as is the case with our data. Second, while for reasons of convergence simultaneous HLM techniques force the researcher to specify most of the independent variables in step-1 as fixed (i.e. as equivalent across countries) this restriction is not present in the two-step approach. Third, two-step procedures give greater control to the researcher, facilitating exploratory analysis and model checking (e.g. detection of outliers, discovery of nonlinearities, sensitivity and robustness analyses). Finally, in contrast to simultaneous HLM techniques two-step procedures do not face convergence problems in the presence of large clusters (i.e. high number of observations per level-2 unit) or cross-level interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020715212452285">Primo et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, with the sample sizes at hand (6.8 million level-1 observations nested in 19 countries) it is computationally not feasible to run simultaneous multilevel models.</p>
<p>In <italic>step-1</italic>, we use the harmonized micro-data from the EULFS and the GMZ to estimate multinomial logistic (MNL) regression models of men’s labour market status. Almost all of the respondents in the EULFS<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0020715212452285">3</xref></sup> can be allocated to one of the six categories of our dependent variable, that is, individuals’ labour market status. We differentiate four employment categories (regular employment, fixed-term work, marginal employment, self-employment) and two non-employment categories (unemployment, inactivity). Those who have been working at least one hour in the reference week, or who have a job from which they are temporarily absent count as employed. Regular employees are those holding a work contract of unlimited duration, while those with contracts of limited duration count as fixed-term workers (irrespective of working time as long as they work at least 15 hours). All respondents stating that they normally work less than 15 hours, or who are family workers, fall into the marginal work category (irrespective of contract type). All non-employed individuals stating that they have been seeking employment in the past four weeks and are available for work are categorized as unemployed. We also count as unemployed those who are not actively seeking employment because they have already found a job.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0020715212452285">4</xref></sup> All non-employed individuals to whom these criteria do not apply count as inactive (e.g. pensioners, full-time students, discouraged workers, ill or disabled persons). Our main substantive interest is on the ‘classical’ labour market outcomes of regular employment, fixed-term work, unemployment and inactivity. However, our analyses will cover the whole spectrum of possible labour market statuses to afford us with a more comprehensive understanding of labour market dynamics in response to institutional change (see below for details).</p>
<p>We run separate regressions for each country-year (i.e. for 19 countries observed for up to 16 years). Based on these 252 step-1 regressions, we then estimate a set of <italic>predicted probabilities</italic> (PPs) for each of the six categories of the outcome variable (labour market status) and for three different age-groups, resulting in 4536 PPs. These analyses control for age (in five-year intervals) and highest level of education or training completed, differentiating three levels: lower secondary (ISCED 0-2; 3c if shorter than two years), upper secondary (ISCED 3-4) and tertiary (ISCED 5-6) education. The PPs are computed for individuals with medium levels of education, who constitute the clear majority group in our sample. This focus of analysis allows us to draw conclusions about <italic>age-based inequality dynamics</italic> that are less likely to be biased by cohort-specific compositional change in educational attainment (educational expansion) than an analysis based on populations with high or low levels of education.</p>
<p>In <italic>step-2</italic>, the PPs become the dependent variables in cross-country panel regressions. In this set-up, the error term consists of two components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020715212452285">Hanushek, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020715212452285">Lewis and Linzer, 2005</xref>): the first owes to the fact that the dependent variable in step-2 is <italic>estimated</italic> (from MNL regressions at level-1) rather than observed (i.e. ‘measured with error’); the second represents the <italic>residual variance</italic> from the step-2 model. The degree of uncertainty of the estimated PPs from step-1 varies across observations. Therefore, to deal with a potential heteroskedasticity in the first component of the error term, we correct standard errors by applying weights to all step-2 regressions. To derive appropriate weights, we follow the approach laid out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020715212452285">Lewis and Linzer (2005)</xref>, which first obtains consistent estimates of the <italic>residual variance</italic> from a level-2 regression and then uses this information together with the standard errors of the step-1 estimates (PPs) to construct a set of weights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0020715212452285">5</xref></sup> This procedure gives greater weight to more precisely estimated PPs and increases the efficiency of parameter estimates in step-2. Each of our step-2 regressions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0020715212452285">6</xref></sup> (run separately for different age-groups), include the PPs from step-1 as the dependent variable, a set of country-level predictors (including time-varying institutions, see below for details), as well as country fixed effects and time dummies. Through the inclusion of time dummies (creating year-specific intercepts) we capture developments over time that are common to all countries (e.g. economic shocks that occur in the same year for all countries). By including a dummy variable for each country, we estimate <italic>fixed effects models</italic> (FE) that control for all unobserved factors at the country-level that are time-invariant (e.g. stable cultural or institutional differences). We employ two variants of <italic>FE models</italic>: one accounting for the uncertainty associated with <italic>estimated</italic> dependent variables (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020715212452285">Gebel and Giesecke, 2011</xref>, for application in panel context), the other ignoring this uncertainty. Given the very high sample sizes in all country-years, however, the PPs for all labour market outcomes are estimated with such precision (significance level generally at <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001), that results from both estimation methods are substantively the same.</p>
<p>Time-varying regressors in the step-2 models include harmonized measures of <italic>employment protection</italic> (from the OECD; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020715212452285">Venn, 2009</xref>), the <italic>regulation of temporary work</italic> (OECD indices for fixed-term contracts and temporary work agencies; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020715212452285">Venn, 2009</xref>), <italic>union strengthi</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0020715212452285">7</xref></sup> (collective bargaining coverage) and the degree of <italic>coordination</italic> of wage bargaining (ICTWSS database; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020715212452285">Visser, 2009</xref>) as well as key interactions between these predictors. Moreover, all models control for the business cycle (level and annual change of GDP per capita, from the WEO database) and skill supply (i.e. share of individuals with at least upper secondary education, from Eurostat). For details on these variables, please refer to Overview 1 in the Appendix. Time-series coverage in the EULFS varies across countries. Moreover, the ICTWSS and OECD databases include some missing values with the result that the overall sample size for the country panel regressions is reduced to 217 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020715212452285">Appendix Table A1</xref>). To address the issue of simultaneity bias that arises when labour market outcomes have a recursive effect on institutional change and macro-economic conditions, we consider only lagged explanatory factors and not contemporaneous ones. During economic downturns firms often hold on to labour for some time before lay-offs are considered (labour hoarding), while upon economic recovery, they continue to operate with fewer workers for some time (jobless growth). Based on the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020715212452285">Mourre (2006)</xref>, we assume a lag of two years for the impact of business cycle variables on employment outcomes. Also structural changes that affect labour costs (e.g. union strength in collective wage-setting, employment protection/regulation) have been shown to have lagged effects on employment dynamics. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020715212452285">Mourre (2006)</xref>, we include our measures of institutional change with a lag of two years in our models to take into account that the impact of institutional change on the labour market is not immediate.</p>

<title>3.3. Temporary work: A novel approach to measuring and testing the impact of regulation</title>
<p>At the theoretical level, our discussion of <italic>temporary work</italic> did not differentiate between employment on fixed-term contracts and temporary agency work. At the empirical level, our individual-level EULFS data do not allow us to clearly identify temporary agency workers, either. In most cases, they fall into our category of fixed-term work, that is, if the agency employs them on a contract of limited duration. If they are employed on an open-ended contract, however, they count as being in regular employment. Our time-series data on institutional change, by contrast, allow us to distinguish between the strictness of regulations of fixed-term contracts and temporary work agencies (for source of data and definition, see Appendix). Taking advantage of this differentiation, we depart from most previous work, which typically used a combined indicator measuring the ‘regulation of temporary work’ (for a notable exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020715212452285">Nunziata and Staffolani, 2007</xref>). As agencies can hire their workers either on fixed-term or open-ended contracts,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0020715212452285">8</xref></sup> it can plausibly be assumed that decisions about the type of contract offered to these workers will depend on the regulation of the two types of contract. For instance, the stricter the protection of regular contracts (i.e. the higher the firing costs), the more attractive it is for employers to recruit their workers from an agency. At the same time, however, the successful development of a temporary work agency sector may be hampered by strict employment protection: when agencies face strong regulations for the use of fixed-term contracts and hence need to conclude open-ended contracts with many of their workers, they will be affected by high firing costs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020715212452285">Baumann et al., 2011</xref>). We aim to go beyond existing work and test not only the interaction between employment protection (EPL) and the regulation of fixed-term contracts and agencies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020715212452285">Nunziata and Staffolani, 2007</xref>) but also the interaction between the latter two.</p>

<title>4. Results</title>
<p>Step-1 estimates, that is, the predicted probabilities for different labour market statuses, countries, years and age-groups are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020715212452285">Figure 1</xref>, with focus on the four outcomes of central interest. As can be seen, age-based differences in labour market outcomes vary both across countries and across time. Similar to employment rates (i.e. employment-to-population ratios), the values pertain to shares of the population in a certain status as a percentage of the total population in the respective age-group. Step-2 regressions are then estimated independently from each other with different outcome variables (the predicted probabilities) and for three different age-groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020715212452285">Tables 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020715212452285">1b</xref>). It is important to note, however, that the individual regressions relate to each other because predicted probabilities sum up to <italic>one</italic> across the six labour market statuses. Since 100 percent of the sample population is covered by one of the six dependent variables, moving across the columns, the coefficients in one row sum up to zero. This analytical strategy allows us to examine how institutional change affects labour market dynamics across the entire spectrum of possible outcomes. For instance, if we observe a negative effect of institutional change on regular employment and at the same time a positive one on fixed-term work, this can be interpreted as an increase in the prevalence of fixed-term work <italic>at the expense</italic> of employment on open-ended contracts.</p>

<p><italic>Notes</italic>: The table presents a summary of results from separate regressions for three age–groups and six dependent variables. For each of the regressions we look at a sample of <italic>N</italic> = 217 cases (country–years) nested in 19 countries. In all models we control for the business cycle and skill supply (see Overview 1 in the Appendix for details on variables). All predictors are lagged by two years. All estimates are based on FE regression models (OLS regressions with country and time dummies), corrected for potential bias from estimated dependent variables (EDV).</p>
</fn>
<fn id="table-fn2-0020715212452285">
<label>a</label>
<p>This refers to average effect of the strictness of EPL, controlled for levels of deregulation of fixed–term contracts (FTC) and temporary work agencies (TWA).</p>
</fn>
<fn id="table-fn3-0020715212452285">
<label>b</label>
<p>Time–invariant dummy referring to strong and weak EPL. Coefficients for the effects of <italic>deregulation</italic> in 1) the strong and 2) the weak EPL contexts are estimated by two regression models: the <italic>deregulation variables are</italic> once interacted with a time invariant dummy that codes 1=strong EPL and 0=weak EPL, and once interacted with the inverse of this dummy that codes 1=weak EPL and 0=strong EPL.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="table-fn4-0020715212452285">
<label>c</label>
<p>This refers to the effect of collective bargaining coverage (CBC) in three different contexts of 1) low, 2) medium and 3) high degrees of wage coordination. The coefficients pertain to context–specific effects of CBC (not interactions) that derive from three regressions in which the main effects pertain to the different degrees of coordination. Overall, the production of all coefficients in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020715212452285">Table 1a</xref> is based on four regressions for each age group and dependent variable (72 regressions in total).</p>

<p>As we expect that the deregulation of fixed-term contracts and temporary work agencies has more pronounced implications in contexts where EPL is strong (see theoretical predictions above), we allow deregulation effects to vary between strong and weak EPL contexts. In addition, we examine interactions between the deregulation of agency work and fixed-term employment. The two measures are centralized so that the effect of agency deregulation pertains to a situation in which the regulation of fixed-term contracts is at a medium level, and vice versa. To facilitate the interpretation of the three-way interaction effects, the EPL measure is converted into a dummy variable (strong versus weak) and the regression coefficients for both levels of EPL are computed as the sum of main and interaction effects. This allows for a direct interpretation of deregulation effects <italic>within</italic> EPL contexts. Moreover, because we expect that the impact of union strength varies depending on the degree of coordination (see theoretical predictions above) we estimate effects of collective bargaining coverage in three different coordination contexts (through interaction effects with the three-category coordination measure, again computed as the sum of main and interaction effects).</p>
<p>As outlined earlier, we estimate two types of fixed-effects model: one which accounts for the fact that we use <italic>estimated</italic> dependent variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020715212452285">Table 1a</xref>) and one which does not (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020715212452285">Table 1b</xref>). Due to the great precision of our step-1 estimates, the two methods produce very similar results.</p>
<sec id="section12-0020715212452285">
<title>4.1. Employment protection legislation</title>
<p>While we find no significant impact of strict EPL on our youngest age group, it shows positive effects for our oldest age group: a one unit increase in levels of protection (measured on a six-point scale; see Overview 1 in Appendix) boosts older prime-agers’ regular employment rate by 2.6 percentage points while reducing their involvement in self-employment by 1.7 percentage points (see results in panels C.1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020715212452285">Tables 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020715212452285">1b</xref> pertaining to individuals aged 50–54). A possible interpretation is that in an environment of weak employment protection, older workers have fewer possibilities to be or remain in regular dependent employment and are forced to revert to self-employment (partial confirmation of hypothesis 1b, increase in regular employment but no reduction in non-employment). As regards our medium age group, we find stricter EPL to increase marginal work and – against what has been predicted – to reduce the incidence of fixed-term employment (see panels B.1). Overall, our findings do not support the common prediction of negative implications of high firing costs especially for young adults. They do confirm, however, that strict EPL boosts regular employment rates for those aged 50 plus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0020715212452285">
<title>4.2. The regulation of temporary work</title>
<p>For young prime-agers, we find very different effects of the deregulation of temporary (agency) work depending on the degree to which regular employment is protected.</p>
<p>When firing costs for regular workers are high (strong EPL), we find evidence of <italic>substitution</italic> effects: the deregulation of temporary work agencies increases the use of fixed-term contracts while depressing regular employment. The regression coefficient suggests that a one unit increase in the variable measuring agency deregulation (on a six-point scale; see Overview 1 in Appendix) reduces this group’s regular employment rate by 1.3 percentage points (see panels A.2). In the case of Germany, which has deregulated agencies by 2.25 scale points between 1990 and 2005 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020715212452285">Venn, 2009</xref>), young prime-agers’ regular employment rate is, for instance, estimated to have decreased by 2.9 percentage points. In line with our expectations, we also find that inactivity rises when agencies are deregulated. And while the deregulation of fixed-term contracts appears to reduce inactivity, our results show that this development concurs with increasing rates of marginal and self-employment. The overall pattern of results for our youngest age group, however, is best understood when we look at the interdependent effects of the deregulation of fixed-term contracts and temporary work agencies. The interaction effects (in panels A.2) indicate that the impact of agency deregulation depends on the degree to which fixed-term contracts are also deregulated, and vice versa. A <italic>concurrent deregulation</italic> may even support (fixed-term) <italic>job creation</italic>, that is, we find evidence for declining unemployment concomitant with an increased incidence of fixed-term employment.</p>
<p>In labour markets with weak EPL (panels A.3), by contrast, temporary work agencies appear to have beneficial effects on young persons’ labour market outcomes. Upon their deregulation (main effect), regular employment rises while unemployment declines (by 1.6 and 1.8 percentage points, respectively). This <italic>creation of regular jobs</italic> following a deregulation of agencies may be a direct effect, with workers being hired on open-ended contracts by the agencies. Alternatively, or additionally, there may be indirect effects: in response to agency deregulation, employers increasingly hire temporary workers from agencies but offer them standard contracts, and include them in their core workforce, after a short screening period.</p>
<p>For mid-career workers, we generally find fewer and weaker effects of labour market reform than for younger adults. Where employment protection is strong (EPL), the <italic>concurrent deregulation</italic> of temporary work agencies and fixed-term contracts can have beneficial effects (panels B.2): Some regular and fixed-term jobs are created, while unemployment declines (by about 1.3 percent points when both fixed-term contracts and agencies are deregulated; see sum of main and interaction effects). In fact, unemployment is reduced already (by almost 1 percentage point) when only fixed-term contracts are deregulated (main effect). Yet, this development does not concur with increased rates of regular employment but of self-employment, instead. In contexts of weak EPL (panels B.3), by contrast, reforms that involve the deregulation of fixed-term contracts and temporary work agencies are shown to increase levels of inactivity.</p>
<p>Deregulation also has implications for our oldest age-group. When regular employment is strictly protected, we observe beneficial effects of the deregulation of temporary work agencies (main effect in panels C.2 on inactivity) as well as of their <italic>concurrent deregulation</italic> with fixed-term contracts (<italic>interaction effects</italic> suggesting creation of regular employment). When regular employment protection is weak (panels C.3), deregulated temporary work agencies somewhat reduce unemployment.</p>
<p>Concluding from our results for three age-groups, it appears that in <italic>rigid labour markets</italic> where regular employment on open-ended contracts involves high firing costs, deregulation of temporary work may indeed have beneficial effects in terms of the <italic>creation of new jobs</italic>. For our two older age-groups, the effects are largely positive: <italic>concurrent deregulation</italic> leads to the creation of new jobs, mostly on open-ended contracts, while rates of unemployment decline. For those aged below 30, however, we find evidence of both undesirable <italic>substitution</italic> effects (i.e. deregulation of temporary work in otherwise rigid labour markets leads to a mere replacement of regular employment with fixed-term work or even inactivity) as well as <italic>job creation</italic> effects that are however constrained to fixed-term work. In more liberal labour markets with lower firing costs and therefore a lower relative cost-advantage of fixed-term work, by contrast, the deregulation of temporary work is in fact shown to create new jobs on open-ended contracts also for young prime-agers.</p>
<p>In our study we cannot differentiate between open-ended contracts that are concluded either with a regular employer or with a temporary work agency. Both count as regular employment. For this reason, we have to be careful in interpreting <italic>regular employment creation</italic> as an outcome (of agency deregulation) that is necessarily preferable to the creation of fixed-term jobs. Working conditions for agency workers tend to be poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020715212452285">Storrie, 2002</xref>). The typically rather short assignments with ‘user companies’ imply that these workers – even if on permanent contract with their agency – may face constant change of their work environment with negative implications for their well-being and access to employer-provided training opportunities. If, however, deregulation opens labour market (re-)entry opportunities by allowing employers a risk-free screening period which in turn facilitates a transition into ‘genuine’ standard employment, then this could be interpreted as an unequivocally positive labour market outcome. Unfortunately, with the data at hand we cannot differentiate between these two mechanisms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0020715212452285">
<title>4.3. Collective bargaining coverage and coordination</title>
<p>For young prime-agers, collective bargaining coverage has very different and in part even opposite employment effects depending on the degree of coordination (see panels A.4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020715212452285">Tables 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020715212452285">1b</xref>). At high levels of coordination, union strength is conducive to regular employment while lowering rates of inactivity. The effect is substantial: an increase of collective bargaining coverage by 10 percentage points boosts regular employment by about six percentage points. In contexts where coordination is at medium levels, collective bargaining coverage appears to reduce rates of inactivity. When bargaining is only weakly coordinated, by contrast, increasing union strength can have harmful effects: it is associated with reduced levels of regular employment and rising self-employment. This suggests that weakly coordinated but strong unions create unfavourable labour market conditions so that young adults resort to self-employment (potentially increasing involuntary self-employment).</p>
<p>Union strength also has very different effects depending on coordination environment for our medium age-group (see panels B.4). When coordination is low, strong unions are found to reduce the incidence of regular employment while pushing self-employment. By contrast, already at medium levels of coordination and even more so at high levels, strong unions substantially increase employment rates while reducing inactivity.</p>
<p>Turning to older prime-agers, we find that at medium and high levels of coordination union strength is associated with the creation of regular employment, while it shows no effects at low levels of coordination (see panels C.4). When coordination is high, rising collective bargaining coverage is furthermore found to reduce rates of unemployment and self-employment. We also find indication of reduced unemployment and self-employment in contexts of medium coordination, but these effects are only significant in the unweighted fixed-effects estimations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020715212452285">Table 1b</xref>), not in the fixed-effects EDV models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020715212452285">Table 1a</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, we conclude that strongly coordinated unions with high collective bargaining coverage positively affect the labour market outcomes of all prime-agers. This is clearly against the predictions from neoclassical economists that hold powerful unions and compressed wage structures to be the main culprit of low employment levels, especially among youth and older workers. In stark contrast to such expectations, we find positive effects of strong unions on <italic>regular employment</italic> in contexts of high levels of coordination for all workers. For our older and medium age-groups such positive employment effects are also observed at medium levels of coordination. Our youngest age-group, by contrast, does not particularly benefit from strong unions in medium coordination contexts, but is not harmed by them either. The hypothesis of hump-shape effects can thus be refuted. Overall, then, we find little support for the neo-classical perspective and their theoretical premise that unions price young and older persons out of employment – at least within the prime-age workforce. Negative union effects on labour market performance appear to occur only in contexts where unions are weakly coordinated – and here mainly for our medium age-group. Overall, our results are thus more strongly supportive of alternative approaches that emphasize positive effects of unions and that predict that positive union effects increase with the degree of coordination. Notably, however, we find that positive union effects are contingent on at least medium levels of coordination (i.e. at least at industry-level).</p>

<title>5. Conclusions</title>
<p>We have presented a country-panel analysis of the impact of institutional change on labour market performance in Europe over the period 1992–2007. The focus of our empirical tests was on the impact of labour market regulation, unions and wage-setting mechanisms. We investigated how these institutions affect inequality dynamics within the <italic>prime-age workforce</italic> (25–54 years of age). Using time series data and a fixed-effects methodology, we came closer to discerning causal effects of institutional change than prior work in this area. Moreover, our research design allowed investigating interrelations between labour market statuses at the macro-level. That is, although our data did not allow for genuine transition analyses (at the individual level), our two-step approach using a full set of predicted probabilities as dependent variables in country-panel regressions, allowed us to discern how changes in ‘employment rates’ (predicted share of the prime-age workforce in dependent employment) are interrelated with changes in rates of unemployment, inactivity and self-employment. This is in stark contrast to prior work, which has in the main analysed indicators of labour market performance (e.g. employment and unemployment rates) in isolation from other employment dynamics. The conclusions drawn from such studies tend to ignore the question of where additional population groups entering a labour market status (e.g. regular employment) ‘come from’. A central aim of our study, by contrast, was to test predictions of <italic>substitution</italic> and <italic>job creation</italic> effects in response to institutional change, that is, theory-driven predictions that necessitate the notion of <italic>transitions</italic> between different labour market statuses – not necessarily at the individual level but at the aggregate level. Moreover, while existing work on age-graded labour market inequalities typically treated prime-age workers as a reference group, our analysis has focused on inequality dynamics <italic>within</italic> this group. It is typically assumed that prime-agers are relatively unaffected by labour market reforms and that it is predominantly younger and older workers falling outside of the prime-age boundaries (age 25–54) who feel the positive or negative consequences of such developments. Yet, our results show that labour market institutions significantly influence age-based inequality dynamics also <italic>within</italic> this group.</p>
<p>We arrive at some important conclusions relevant to sociologists of the labour market and the life-course. We find that those most affected by high firing costs are older prime-agers (aged 50–54). They are the only ones significantly benefiting from high levels of EPL and are in turn also the only ones suffering when it is dismantled (i.e. they resort to self-employment). Moreover, in contrast to ‘conventional wisdom’ among labour economists, we do not find that strict employment protection legislation per se has any negative implications for labour market performance. It is well known, however, that strict protection of standard employment has led policy-makers in many countries to deregulate temporary work. It is these <italic>partial reforms</italic> that have in fact increased the attractiveness of temporary work for employers and that have boosted the incidence of fixed-term work, especially among the younger population (youth and as shown in this study also young prime-agers). We also investigated the impact of deregulatory reforms in labour markets that do <italic>not</italic> feature high firing costs for employees on permanent contracts. Temporary work has also been deregulated in such contexts, with non-negligible effects on labour markets. Here, however, deregulated temporary work agencies are shown to boost employment rates of young prime-agers while reducing their risk of unemployment.</p>
<p>Our study thus shows that labour market reforms have age-graded effects also within the prime-age workforce and may trigger a disadvantage of young workers especially upon the deregulation of temporary work agencies in otherwise strongly regulated labour markets. Union strength, by contrast, is not found to have any clear-cut implications for age-based stratification in labour market outcomes. Our results do not support neo-classical strands of economic theory which expect strong unions to increase age-based labour market inequalities by pricing young and old workers out of employment. The focus of economists’ empirical work has mainly been on youth and the elderly. Yet, the logic of their predictions should in principle also apply to age-grading within the prime-age workforce. Our findings show that in labour market contexts with high levels of coordination union strength has positive employment effects <italic>across all ages</italic> within the prime-age population. In weakly coordinated labour markets, however, strong unions can have negative effects for young and mid-career workers. Overall, we find that at low and medium levels of coordination, unions have some potential to increase age-based labour market inequalities, but at high levels of coordination all age-groups benefit equitably from strong unions.</p>
<p>In sum, the findings of our study show that a better understanding of the implications of policy developments for social inequality necessitates a careful and nuanced analysis that accounts for the fact that the impact of any institutional change is strongly context-dependent. Reform effects are age-graded and they depend on concurring policy developments and the broader institutional context. Deregulatory reforms have been carried out both in more and less strongly regulated European labour markets, with varying effects on labour market performance. Our analyses reveal that deregulatory reforms may be conducive to <italic>the creation of new jobs</italic>. Yet, it remains an open question in the present study, in how far the <italic>quality of jobs</italic> created in response to deregulation can be compared to jobs created under different conditions. More research is needed on <italic>work agencies</italic>, their function in different labour market contexts (i.e. in more or less rigid markets) as creators of low quality jobs and/or as facilitators of labour market re(entry) for labour market outsiders that can use agency jobs as stepping stones to higher quality regular jobs. Moreover, while our main focus in this study was on ‘classical’ labour market outcomes, our results suggest that self-employment plays an important role in the observed labour market dynamics in response to institutional change. Yet, to date we still know very little about the actual implications of self-employment. Is this self-employment due to lack of opportunities for quality employment and hence ‘involuntary’? How much of it is ‘quasi’ self-employment which helps employers circumvent some of the risks and costs attached to standard contracts but which may be detrimental for workers? More research is warranted to better understand self-employment and its implications for labour market inequality.</p>

<p><italic>Employment protection (EPL)</italic>: Source: OECD. Definition: indicator for dismissal of employees on regular contracts, quantifying the costs and procedures involved in dismissing individuals or groups of workers (‘firing costs’); annual data, scale from 0-weak/no regulation to 6-strict regulation (OECD Subject Code: EPR_v1). Data for Slovenia made available to the authors by Milan Vodopivec (World Bank), data for 1991–2004. For the analyses, the continuous variable is used to estimate the main effect of EPL. Additionally, the variable is dichotomized (strong versus weak EPL, the latter referring to values lower than 2.17, which is the case for six countries: Belgium, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Poland and UK). This dummy measure of EPL is time-invariant at country-level and allows for better interpretation of its interaction with the deregulation of FTCs and TWAs.</p>
<p><italic>Deregulation of fixed terms contracts (FTCdereg)</italic>: Source: OECD. Definition: strictness of regulation of fixed-term contracts (valid cases for use of fixed term contracts, maximum number of successive fixed-term contracts, and maximum cumulated duration of successive fixed-term contracts) (OECD Subject Code: TEMPORARY1). Data for Slovenia made available to the authors by Milan Vodopivec (World Bank), for 1991–2004. The original scale from 0-weak/no regulation to 6-strict regulation is reversed to measure de-regulation. The variable is centralized (the zero value referring to mean value of 2.25 of the original scale).</p>
<p><italic>Deregulation of temporary work agencies (TWAdereg)</italic>: Source: OECD. Definition: strictness of regulation of temporary work agency employment (types of work for which temporary work agency work is legal, restrictions on number of renewals of temporary work agency contracts, and maximum cumulated duration of successive temporary work agency contracts) (OECD Subject Code: TEMPORARY1_v1). Data for Slovenia made available to the authors by Milan Vodopivec (World Bank), for 1991–2004. The original scale from 0-weak/no regulation to 6-strict regulation is reversed to measure de-regulation. The variable is centralized (the zero value referring to mean value of 2.19 of the original scale).</p>
<p><italic>Collective bargaining coverage (CBC)</italic>: Source: ICTWSS database compiled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020715212452285">Visser (2009)</xref>. Definition: employees covered by wage bargaining agreements as a percentage of all wage and salary earners in employment with the right to bargaining, adjusted for the possibility that some sectors or occupations are excluded from the right to bargain (ICTWSS subject code: AdjCov). This indicator is measured annually. Divided by 10, the values range 0–10. Values have been imputed in cases where the database provides values for odd years, while the in-between value is missing (e.g. in Hungary we observe the same value for 2003 and 2005 but have a missing value for 2004; in Greece we observe a constant value of 80 in the years 1990, 1993, 1995 and 1998, while the years in-between have missing values). Based on the assumption that we observe an underlying time-invariant time-series during these periods, the missing values are replaced by the constant value. Values for eight country-years are added by this procedure (2005 for CZ, 2004 for HU, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2004 for EL).</p>
<p><italic>Coordination of wage-setting</italic> (COORD): Source: ICTWSS database compiled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020715212452285">Visser (2009)</xref>. Definition: The variable reflects a five-point classification of wage-setting coordination distinguishing between 1) economy-wide bargaining, 2) mixed industry and economy-wide bargaining, 3) industry bargaining, 4) mixed industry-level and firm-level bargaining, and 5) fragmented bargaining, mostly at company level (ICTWSS subject code: WCoord). Among the 217 cases (country-years) covered in the model, the time-varying distribution among the five categories is: 8.3%, 11.5%, 19.4%, 54.4%, 6.5%. The variable is collapsed to create a three-category variable, by collapsing categories 1&amp;2 (high) as well as 4&amp;5 (low). For the analysis, a time-invariant measure is created. In the majority of cases, the allocation of countries to the three categories is straightforward, as they stay within one of the tree categories in the entire observation period (high in AT, BE, DE, EL, NL, SK, SI, low in CZ, FR, HU, PL, UK). For the remaining seven countries, the category into which most of the yearly values fall is used (DK, SE, ES and PT are allocated to the medium coordination category and FI, IT and NO to the high coordination category), while those yearly values that fall outside this ‘time-invariant category’ are set to missing (the missing category comprises 18 cases and is included as a separate dummy in the analysis interacted with CBC to preserve the sample size).</p>

<p>This paper is the result of a research project that was supported by the 6th Framework Programme EQUALSOC Network of Excellence. This support is gratefully acknowledged. We would also like to thank Klaudia Erhardt for her helpful research assisstance. Part of the study was carried out when Martina Dieckhoff held a Max Weber Fellowship and Nadia Steiber a Marie Curie Fellowship at the European University Institute (EUI), Florence,Italy. Both authors contributed equally. The European Commission, Eurostat, kindly provided access to the European Union Labour Force Survey (release 10/2008). The conclusions of the study are those of the authors, not of the European Commission or Eurostat. Earlier versions of the paper were presented at the Final EQUALSOC Conference in Amsterdam, June 2010, at the ISA World Congress of Sociology in Gothenburg, July 2010, at the WES Conference in Brighton, September 2010, and at the Joint ECSR/QMSS2/TransEurope Conference in Bamberg, September 2010. We thank the participants at these conferences for their critical feedback. We are also grateful to Fabrizio Bernardi and Martin Kohli for their comments. Ulrich Kohler’s advice on one central aspect of the Stata programming was very much appreciated. Special thanks go to the three anonymous referees and the IJCS editor, David A. Smith, for their valuable suggestions which helped us to improve the article. All remaining errors are our own.</p>

<p>Claims by sociologists about the effects of employment protection for youth tend to be more nuanced than those by economists, however, because the education and training system is often acknowledged as a central mediating factor (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020715212452285">Breen, 2005</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>Our definition deviates from the standard ILO definition in two ways. In our study, individuals who claim to have been actively seeking work within the past four weeks count as unemployed (instead of inactive) even if they do not report to have taken any of the specified ‘methods’ to find a job (thus relaxing the criterion of seeking work). We also depart from the ILO definition in that we count individuals as unemployed who already found a job and are therefore not searching (instead of inactive) even if they will not start that job within the next three months.</p></fn>

<p>We use collective bargaining coverage instead of union density to measure union strength, because there are a number of countries, where collectively bargained wages and conditions cover a majority of the workforce despite low union membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020715212452285">Visser and Checchi, 2009</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>In most countries, temporary agency work is based on a tripartite agreement: the worker is hired by the agency (either on an open-ended or fixed-term contract), while the user firm concludes a lease agreement with the agency.</p></fn>
