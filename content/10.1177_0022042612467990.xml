<abstract>
<p>OxyContin, a controlled-release opioid developed and produced by Purdue Pharma, was given Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in December 1995. By 1999, to the apparent surprise of Purdue Pharma, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the FDA, extensive reports of OxyContin abuse and diversion began to circulate. The drug abuse assessment liability system in the United States has often been criticized and the experience with OxyContin did nothing but buttress those criticisms. However, as seven investigational hearings conducted by the U.S. Congress would expose, several changes were made to the abuse liability assessment to correct deficiencies in the system which had aggravated OxyContin abuse and diversion—a welcome sign from what many have considered an American tragedy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>OxyContin, a controlled-release form of the narcotic analgesic oxycodone, received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in December 1995 and was designated a Schedule II substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612467990">Cicero, Inciardi, &amp; Munoz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612467990">Griffin &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>). OxyContin represented a new formulation of oxycodone, an opioid drug that had been available for clinical use since before the Second World War. OxyContin could be distinguished from other oxycodone formulations on the market (such as Percocet, Percodan, Tylox, and OxyIR) by its release system, which provided a controlled dose of the medication for up to 12 hr of pain relief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612467990">Griffin &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612467990">Inciardi &amp; Goode, 2003</xref>). OxyContin proved to be a remarkably successful new preparation, experiencing steady and impressive levels of growth in the years after it was introduced to the pharmaceutical market in the United States. Along with these sales increases came initial reports of abuse and diversion. Although these reports began to draw national attention by 1999, they were regional in nature, with problems said to be particularly acute in rural areas of the United States and especially in Appalachia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612467990">Baumrucker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612467990">Cicero et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612467990">Griffin &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612467990">Inciardi &amp; Goode, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612467990">Meier, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612467990">Tunnell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612467990">Van Zee, 2009</xref>). It has been speculated these regional patterns of OxyContin abuse reflected lower levels of traditional illegal drug supply in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612467990">Griffin &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612467990">Inciardi &amp; Goode, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612467990">Meier, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequent studies have identified numerous factors associated with the problem of OxyContin abuse. Leaving aside the actual size or scope of the problem, by far the most important factor in abuse was the ability of users to manipulate the product and obtain immediate access to the full dose of oxycodone contained in the time-release product. Indeed, the manipulation involved nothing more complex than crushing the medication; recreational users appear to have identified this almost immediately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612467990">Carise et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612467990">Cicero et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612467990">Griffin &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612467990">Inciardi &amp; Goode, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612467990">Sees et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612467990">Tunnell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612467990">Van Zee, 2009</xref>). Indeed, Purdue Pharma appears to have been aware of this vulnerability even as OxyContin was being given FDA approval. According to tests conducted by Purdue Pharma, crushing a capsule of OxyContin would allow a would-be recreational user to immediately receive up to 68% of the oxycodone contained in a capsule of OxyContin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612467990">Griffin &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612467990">Van Zee, 2009</xref>). Despite this, an abuse-resistant formulation of OxyContin, one that resisted being crushed in this manner, was not developed and approved until 2010; in that year, Purdue Pharma introduced the reformulation and ceased sales of the original formulation.</p>
<p>Although a broad consensus has formed around the idea that OxyContin was simply too easy for nonmedical users to manipulate—or, in other words, making its product too vulnerable to a certain segment of consumer demand—a number of accounts also charge Purdue Pharma with acting inappropriately to <italic>increase</italic> consumer demand. These accounts generally link levels of abuse and diversion with the advertisement and promotion practices of Purdue Pharma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612467990">Griffin &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612467990">Meier, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612467990">Van Zee, 2009</xref>). Pharmaceutical advertising and promotion, of course, have been an important component of the drug business for more than a century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612467990">Courtwright, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612467990">Spillane, 2000</xref>). For nearly that same length of time, critics of the industry have linked advertising practices with a host of social harms: undue influence over medical prescribing, manipulation of consumer sentiment, and outright fraud. Representatives of Purdue Pharma<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022042612467990">1</xref></sup> claimed the advertising campaign for OxyContin was conservative because the company only advertised in medical journals and directly to physicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612467990">Dodd, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612467990">Friedman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612467990">Goldenheim, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612467990">2002</xref>). This has long been the primary legitimizing argument for promotional efforts, with historical roots in the attempt by the major pharmaceutical companies to distinguish their practices from patent medicine firms, which advertised directly to the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612467990">Courtwright, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612467990">Spillane, 2000</xref>). That said, few things about the scale of the OxyContin promotional campaign could be called conservative. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612467990">Van Zee (2009)</xref> noted, in 2001 alone, Purdue Pharma spent US$200 million on advertising and promotion for OxyContin. In addition to advertisements in medical journals, the company conducted more than 40 national pain-management and speaker-training conferences. The scope of the campaign was one thing; subsequent assessments have also charged Purdue Pharma with inappropriate content to the campaign as well, promoting the use of OxyContin beyond reasonable medical bounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612467990">Meier, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612467990">Van Zee, 2009</xref>). Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612467990">Griffin and Miller (2011)</xref> noted, the FDA sent two warning letters to Purdue Pharma concerning the advertisement of OxyContin.</p>
<p>In 2007, Purdue Pharma (the corporation) pled guilty in federal court to a felony count of misbranding OxyContin. Three executives of the company pled guilty to a misdemeanor count of misbranding OxyContin as well. As a consequence of these plea agreements, Purdue Pharma agreed to pay US$470 in fines to federal government as well as US$130 million to satisfy personal injury claims. The three company executives agreed to 3 years of supervised probation each (but no jail or prison time), 400 hr of community service, and collectively paid US$34.5 million in fines. Reaction to the settlement was mixed. Some applauded the outcome, but critics attacked the settlement from both sides, either for undue leniency or for undue severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612467990">Griffin &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The plea agreement very well might have been the end of the story, and OxyContin might have been taken off the market, banished to Schedule I<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022042612467990">2</xref></sup> of the CSA, but for the fact that it was (and still is) identified as an important tool in pain management. Consequently, the emphasis has remained focused on balancing the legitimate needs of medical practice with the control of abuse. At the first of seven congressional hearings investigating OxyContin,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022042612467990">3</xref></sup> and other prescription drugs to a lesser degree, Congressman James C. Greenwood (R–Pennsylvania; 2001) made this quite clear: “For some, OxyContin is the angel of mercy; for others, it is the angel of death” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612467990">Greenwood, 2001</xref>, p. 1). Unlike some “problem drugs,” the medical utility of OxyContin meant that removing the drug from the legitimate pharmaceutical market appears never to have been a serious option. By taking this option off the table, however, policymakers were forced to take a serious look at how well the drug abuse liability assessment system functioned. In the end, the lessons of the OxyContin case generated some positive and overdue changes to this regulatory system.</p>

<sec id="section2-0022042612467990">
<title>A Reliance on Faulty Analogies</title>
<p>One of the questions that was commonly directed to witnesses testifying at the Congressional hearings involved the failure to anticipate the levels of abuse and diversion of OxyContin, particularly in light of the knowledge, at the time of approval, that users could crush the medication to obtain high dosage levels. Purdue Pharma officials took the position that the company had not seen widespread abuse or diversion associated with MS-Contin and expected patterns of OxyContin use to be analogous. FDA testimony at the hearing suggests that the agency, too, supported the MS-Contin analogy. FDA administrators, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612467990">Dr. John Jenkins (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612467990">Dr. Robert Meyer (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612467990">2005</xref>), and Dr. Sandra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612467990">Kweder (2006)</xref>, testified that the agency did not believe many drug users would crush OxyContin pills and all three stated flatly that the dangers associated with the drug were unexpected and unforeseen.</p>
<p>One of the reasons drug abuse liability assessment often is forced to rely on drug analogies is the nature of the drug approval process itself. One of the problems of assessing abuse liability, in human clinical trials, is that these trials are primarily concerned with drug safety and efficacy. In addition, many trials use traditional patients who need the drug for medical purposes and whether they enjoy using a drug (an indicator of potential recreational use) is not given a lot of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612467990">Brady, Lydiard, &amp; Brady, 2003</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612467990">Balster and Bigelow (2003)</xref> noted, a <italic>College on Problems of Drug Dependence</italic> report argued, “Testing should include representatives of ‘the population likely to be administered the drug clinically’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612467990">Balster &amp; Bigelow, 2003</xref>, p. S17). They additionally note that many experts within the field argue that drug abusers are “the most appropriate test population” when considering abuse liability assessment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612467990">Griffiths, Bigelow, and Ator (2003)</xref> argued that oversights in abuse liability assessment can be corrected by assessing abuse liability in human subjects (on a volunteer basis) with histories of substance abuse. One shortcoming with such an approach, however, is that human studies are tightly controlled and human volunteers are supposed to take the drug as directed. They are not allowed to alter the drug, such as crushing the drug to snort or inject it. Although such occurrences can be foreseen, these methods of intake or drug alteration cannot be observed in a human clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022042612467990">Wright, Kramer, Zalman, Smith, &amp; Haddox, 2006</xref>). In the absence of these forms of testing, a reliance on analogies to drugs previously marketed becomes more important.</p>
<p>Relying on the postmarketing experience with MS-Contin as a predictor of what would happen with OxyContin, however, was problematic for two reasons. First, MS-Contin is a morphine-based medication. Many have noted oxycodone produces fewer side-effects and, at the time of OxyContin’s entry into the marketplace, carried less social stigma than morphine. To many potential patients, morphine is perceived as a dangerous narcotic that is only taken by terminally ill patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612467990">Abrahm, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612467990">Glare &amp; Walsh, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612467990">Kalso &amp; Vainio, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612467990">Levy, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612467990">2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612467990">2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612467990">Meyer, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612467990">2005</xref>). Purdue Pharma executives correctly predicted that, for these reasons (along with therapeutic efficacy), OxyContin would be more widely used than MS-Contin. Analogizing to the experience with a drug many correctly believed would be less prescribed (MS-Contin) to predict outcomes with a more heavily prescribed drug (OxyContin), should have given regulators pause at the outset. Second, MS-Contin is a sustained-release medication. Although OxyContin functions as a sustained-release medication, when crushed, it becomes an immediate-release medication. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612467990">Meier (2003)</xref> noted, MS-Contin did not have the same defect in design that OxyContin had. Therefore, although MS-Contin could be abused recreationally, it did not provide the same immediate-release as OxyContin. Furthermore, even if many recreational drug users were unaware that crushing a pill of OxyContin bypassed the time-release mechanism, a warning on packages of the drug OxyContin specifically warning users may have actually worked as an unintended advertisement to the users of the drug.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022042612467990">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, OxyContin was pure oxycodone, so a drug user did not have to worry about ingesting too much acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin, which is added to many other forms of oxycodone-based drugs (such as Percocet, Percodan, and Tylox). Thus, the only real similarity between these two drugs was their general role in pain management, and the same manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. This analogy appears to have been widely and genuinely accepted but, in retrospect, it was naïve at best and negligent at worst.</p>
<p>Two more germane analogies drug regulators might have relied on, when considering the potential misuse of OxyContin, involved the postmarketing histories of Benzedrine and pentazocine. In 1933, Smith, Kline, and French patented and released a Benzedrine inhaler to the American pharmaceutical market. The inhaler was intended as a decongestant and bronchodilator. If a person felt congestion, the instructions advised to use the drug every hour as needed. Instead of using the inhaler as directed, many people would break the inhaler open and remove a piece of filter paper that contained 100 mg of Benzedrine carbonate sprayed on it. The filter paper could easily be dissolved into a cup of coffee. The inhaler became popular among U.S. servicemen during World War II and among students and truckers after the war. The abuse of the Benzedrine inhaler became a classic example of users obtaining high dosage forms of a drug and finding a way to access the entire high dosage immediately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612467990">Jackson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612467990">Rasmussen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1967, pentazocine, marketed under the trade name Talwin, was given FDA approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612467990">Baum, Hsu, &amp; Nelson, 1987</xref>). The drug, a non-narcotic analgesic, was not known as a drug of abuse, and in the immediate following years, misuse was confined to small numbers of people within the medical community. Beginning in the late 1970s though, enterprising drug users discovered that dissolving Talwin tablets with the antihistamine tripelennamine, filtering the solution, and injecting it intravenously produced a high similar to using heroin. Such a mixture became known as the “T’s and blues.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022042612467990">5</xref></sup> This combination of drugs quickly became a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612467990">Baum et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612467990">Poklis, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612467990">Showalter, 1980</xref>). In 1981, Sterling-Winthrop (now Winthrop Breon) met with FDA officials to discuss possible solutions to the problem. The company agreed to remove Talwin from the pharmaceutical market and in 1982 was given FDA approval for the drug Talwin Nx. This new formulation of the drug added 0.5 mg of naloxone HCl (a narcotic antagonist) to pentazocine. When taken as directed, the naloxone had no effect on the medication. However, when the medication was crushed and injected, the naloxone blocked most of the euphoric high previously experienced. This change in formulation coincided with the effective end of the T’s and blues “epidemic”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022042612467990">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612467990">Baum et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612467990">Poklis, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, at least two reliable prior cases demonstrating the extent to which recreational abusers will abuse defective medications were available to drug regulators, though there is no evidence that they played any substantial role in decision making regarding OxyContin. Whether consideration of these analogies would have actually led to the FDA denying approval for OxyContin seems doubtful, even after widespread abuse and diversion were discovered, given the weight of the medical utility argument. There is some evidence that FDA has become more cautious in considering similar design defects since the original approval process for OxyContin. The case of another Purdue Pharma product, the drug Palladone, illustrates the point.</p>
<p>Palladone is a narcotic analgesic twice as powerful as OxyContin and approved by the FDA as a 24-hr extended-release hydromorphone-based medication. Palladone, a product of Purdue Pharma, was given FDA approval on September 24, 2004. On July 13, 2005, Palladone was removed from the pharmaceutical market. The drug was pulled from the market due to a concern of possible fatal reactions to alcohol. The FDA stated Purdue Pharma did not give adequate data prior to the approval of Palladone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612467990">Dr. Robert Meyer (2005)</xref> noted when the FDA approved the drug Palladone, there was evidence alcohol could be used to extract hydromorphone from Palladone capsules. Neither the FDA nor Purdue Pharma anticipated this finding would indicate life-threatening interactions between Palladone and alcohol. After Palladone was given approval, the FDA received new data indicating “dose-dumping” occurs in patients if Palladone is taken with alcohol. In a study of 24 healthy men, concentrations of hydromorphone in the blood were 5.5 times higher when a 12-mg Palladone capsule was taken with 8 ounces of 40% alcohol. Lower concentrations of alcohol showed smaller but still potentially serious effects on the release of hydromorphone from Palladone. Based on this information, the FDA determined the formulation of Palladone presented an unacceptable risk and Purdue Pharma agreed to suspend sales and marketing of Palladone. During questioning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612467990">Meyer (2005)</xref> stated Palladone seemed like a promising medication. The time-release mechanism could not be crushed like OxyContin. Referring to the “dose-dumping” of alcohol, Meyer noted “it was a regulatory learning from our standpoint that something that in the laboratory could release drug in exposure to high amounts of alcohol could actually do that in the patient setting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612467990">Meyer, 2005</xref>, p. 54).</p>

<title>Postmarketing Surveillance</title>
<p>A recurring sentiment from the Congressional hearings on OxyContin was a frustration, on the part of members of Congress, at the apparently imprecise or incomplete data on drug abuse and diversion. Federal agencies could not provide congressional committees with concrete or consistent answers about the most fundamental questions, such as the prevalence and patterns of use. The lack of consistent and reliable data on postmarketing drug abuse was hardly specific to the OxyContin case; of course, despite the critical fact that drug-related problems often appear only after FDA approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612467990">Arfken &amp; Cicero, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612467990">Hawthorne, 2005</xref>). Despite what some observers would call an overcautious drug regulation scheme in the United States, postmarketing surveillance is still relatively new and developing. Postmarketing surveillance is typically limited to reporting institutional surveillance systems (such as the Drug Abuse Warning Network [DAWN]) or public surveys (such as Monitoring the Future or the National Survey on Drug Use and Health [NSDUH]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612467990">Arfken &amp; Cicero, 2003</xref>). The experience with OxyContin would illustrate at least two significant flaws in postmarketing surveillance systems.</p>
<p>First, because OxyContin was often abused and diverted in rural areas of the United States (and particularly Appalachia), much of the postmarketing surveillance (which more heavily samples from urban areas) underreported the amount of harm OxyContin caused. For instance, according to the DAWN survey, hospitals that submit emergency room reports of samples from metropolitan hospitals and the 145 medical examiner jurisdictions originate from 43 metropolitan areas. NSDUH interviews approximately 70,000 randomly selected people but samples 4 times as many people (3,600 compared with 900) from eight “large sample states” consisting of California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Of these states, only Pennsylvania has been widely associated with OxyContin abuse and diversion. Typically, the Monitoring the Future study does a better job of including rural areas by accounting for different geographic area.</p>
<p>Second, OxyContin represented just one of many oxycodone-based medications, and postmarketing surveillance was generally unable to distinguish between particular medications. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612467990">Meier (2003)</xref> noted, this problem was highlighted when the DEA attempted to determine how many deaths could be attributed to OxyContin. The agency made the mistake of stating more than 500 deaths were OxyContin related when, in actuality, the agency was only able to state with certainty that these deaths were oxycodone related. Indeed, many of these deaths involved polydrug users, further complicating the ability to make reliable statements about postmarketing drug-related harms. The impact of these sorts of problems is perhaps best summed up by a United States General Accounting Office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612467990">GAO, 2003</xref>) report:
<disp-quote>
<p>The databases the DEA uses to track the abuse and diversion of controlled substances all have limitations that prevent an assessment of the relationship between the availability of OxyContin and areas where the drug is being abused or diverted. Specifically, these databases, which generally do not provide information on specific brand-name drugs such as OxyContin, are based on data gathered from limited sources in specific geographic areas and have a significant time lag. As a result, they do not provide reliable, complete, or timely information that could be used to identify abuse and diversion of a specific drug. (p. 32)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the failures to adequately monitor abuse and diversion of OxyContin certainly highlighted deficiencies in the postmarketing surveillance components of the abuse liability assessment system, many of these deficiencies were already well known to researchers in the field. But, neither the work of investigators nor state regulatory action produced the most substantial changes in the post-OxyContin period; rather, the most substantial developments came from industry-sponsored programs. In the same year that OxyContin was introduced to the U.S. pharmaceutical market, an industry-based program focused on the drug tramadol hydrochloride began and would become the model for future postmarketing “risk-management plans” for prescription drugs. In 1995, the drug tramadol hydrochloride was introduced to the American drug market under the trade name Ultram. Ultram was an analgesic that had been marketed in Europe since the late 1970s. The manufacturers of Ultram requested that the drug be placed onto the U.S. market without being scheduled under the CSA. The FDA tentatively granted the request; provided that the company-undertook aggressive postmarketing surveillance accurately track any abuse liability problems. One such study contacted monitoring services for health care professionals with substance abuse, mental health, and physical disorders. The participants in this study were already required to give urine samples to monitor drug use. Ultram was added to the list of screened substances to determine whether there were indications that it was a drug of abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612467990">Knisely, Campbell, Dawson, &amp; Schnoll, 2002</xref>). Another postmarketing study of Ultram interviewed a “key informant network” comprising 110 National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) grantees studying populations that abuse drugs and 145 other drug abuse experts. These results were compared with reports from the FDA MedWatch reporting system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612467990">Cicero et al., 1999</xref>). A subsequent postmarketing survey of Ultram specifically evaluated the veracity of reports of Ultram abuse to MedWatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022042612467990">Woody et al., 2003</xref>). Other studies surveyed persons admitted to drug abuse treatment centers to monitor what drugs they are using (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612467990">Arfken, Schuster, &amp; Johanson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612467990">Jaffe et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>By the February 2004 Congressional hearing on OxyContin, the FDA’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612467990">Dr. Robert Meyer (2004)</xref> assured the committee that in some instances, the agency, in conjunction with the manufacturer of a drug, would develop “a plan of intervention beyond just labeling to help assure the safe and effective use of the drug” (p. 13). He noted these plans had been recently referred to as risk-management plans, “but the practice dates back many years” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612467990">Meyer, 2004</xref>, p. 13). According to Meyer, the FDA conducts postmarketing surveillance that monitors drugs for safety and allows “for reassessments of drug risk based on new data learned after marketing” (p. 13). He continued “When needed, we then recommend ways to most appropriately manage these newly identified risks. In part prompted by our experience with OxyContin post-marketing, FDA has undertaken a number of actions to help prevent prescription drug abuse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612467990">Meyer, 2004</xref>, p. 13). Meyer noted the action plans of the FDA included labeling “the high dose opiates, particularly the extended release products” (p. 14). He not only noted labeling informed prescribers and patients of the proper use of the drug but also defined the parameters of marketing and advertising. After a drug had a labeling change,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022042612467990">7</xref></sup> Meyer argued it was the responsibility of the manufacturer of the drug to notify health care professionals about the risks associated with the drug. In addition to labeling drugs as a means to curb abuse, the FDA supports prescription-monitoring programs and risk-management plans and meets regularly with the DEA to coordinate efforts to prevent prescription drug abuse. Regarding risk-management plans, the September 2003 meeting of the Anesthetic and Life Support Drugs Advisory Committee and a December 2003 GAO report recommended all new drug applications have risk-management plans as part of the application. According to Meyer, “The Agency agrees with these recommendations and believes that it is highly desirable for all extended release or high concentration Schedule II opiate drug products to have RMPs in place at the time of approval” (p. 26). Meyer noted risk-management plans would vary depending on the “safety profile” of medications but would generally include the identification of appropriate patients, assuring the safe and informed use of the product by both practitioners and patients, and monitoring for adverse outcomes, including misuse, overdose, abuse, and diversion. He further noted, “FDA plans to provide more specific guidance to the pharmaceutical industry on the development, implementation, and evaluation of RMPs this year” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612467990">Meyer, 2004</xref>, p. 27).</p>
<p>It is hardly surprising, therefore, that Purdue Pharma itself supported the development (in 2002) of the Researched Abuse, Diversion, and Addiction-Related Surveillance (RADARS) program to help assess and monitor OxyContin abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022042612467990">8</xref></sup> Two researchers closely associated with the early development of the RADARS system, Ted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612467990">Cicero (2006)</xref> and Sidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612467990">Schnoll (2008)</xref>, suggest that Purdue Pharma initiated the RADARS system in part because the company remained skeptical of the reports of widespread abuse and believed that more accurate postmarketing surveillance data would probably show less abuse than media reporting suggested. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612467990">Cicero (2006)</xref>, in fact, believed that RADARS was designed to provide empirical validation for the company’s belief that media stories regarding the extent of OxyContin abuse were being exaggerated. Sidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612467990">Schnoll (2008)</xref>, approached by Purdue Pharma in 2001 because of his experience in helping establish the programs to monitor tramadol use, believed the company genuinely did not have a true sense of the OxyContin problem. Based on the negative media exposure, Schnoll recalled, the company wanted to determine whether the reports were accurate and did not have the means to collect usable data without constructing an entirely new surveillance system.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612467990">Cicero’s (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612467990">Schnoll’s (2008)</xref> assessments of the OxyContin experience diverge a bit, despite their common interest in postmarketing surveillance. Cicero observed that the problem of OxyContin abuse was not greatly exaggerated, and concludes that Purdue Pharma “really erred in the way they marketed the drug” (p. 19). According to Cicero, Purdue Pharma was still maintaining their original argument that the drug was “impervious to abuse” due to the time-release capsule (which they argued could not be bypassed) and slow-acting drugs are rarely abused. He noted addicts, who are typically clever, realized almost immediately the time-release capsule could be bypassed and concluded that OxyContin abuse was “the trigger for the initiation of prescription opioid analgesic abuse which is now reaching epidemic proportions in this country” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612467990">Cicero, 2006</xref>, p. 19). For his part, Schnoll noted that, once the RADARS system was in place, it confirmed that OxyContin abuse was highly regionalized. In addition to the reporting system, a group of field researchers who followed up reported cases of OxyContin abuse determined that reports of “OxyContin” abuse were often incorrectly identified and confused with other drugs. Schnoll found the RADARS data to be unexceptional and confirmed his view that media coverage had a distorting effect on understanding the true nature of OxyContin abuse.</p>
<p>Even if the RADARS data have not led to consensus about the true nature of OxyContin abuse, it remains true that the RADARS system was an important step in the history of postmarketing surveillance. Since then, a series of additional developments has strengthened the system—and confirmed that the hybrid public–private quality of postmarketing surveillance would continue to predominate. By March 2005, the FDA established a set of guidelines for risk-management plans in response to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 gave the FDA the authority to require pharmaceutical companies to develop a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure that the benefits of any drug or biological product outweighed the risks of the drug or biological product. On February 6, 2009, the FDA sent letters to manufacturers of long-acting and extended-release opioids with the active ingredients fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone alerting these manufacturers they would be required to submit REMS for their pharmaceutical products.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022042612467990">9</xref></sup> As recently as May 16, 2011, the FDA met with the Industry Working Group (IWG) and other pharmaceutical companies to discuss the implementation of REMS through a “single shared system.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022042612467990">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the implementation of risk-management plans is important for postmarketing surveillance, these assessments are not limited to federal agencies and pharmaceutical companies. From the time of the very first Congressional hearing, members of the Congress, drug regulators, and even executives of Purdue Pharma noted the individual states in America needed to do a better job of monitoring prescription drug sales. Although the DEA had access to the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) to track pharmaceutical sales, the system could only monitor sales trends. Furthermore, these data were only available with a time lag and it was left up to the DEA to determine whether spikes in sales in certain areas actually represented a problem. To help encourage individual states to implement and maintain prescription drug monitoring programs, the Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Program was enacted in 2002. Since that time, 47 states and one U.S. territory have received financial assistance from the federal government for these programs. Currently, 35 states have operational prescription drug monitoring programs, 13 states, Guam, and Washington, D.C., have enacted legislation but do not have fully operational programs, and Missouri and New Hampshire have pending legislation to develop these programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022042612467990">11</xref></sup> This is a big change from 2000, when only 15 states had operational prescription drug monitoring programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612467990">Madras, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Risk-management plans and state-level monitoring systems are evolving, but the public furor over OxyContin abuse and diversion has surely ushered in new era of postmarketing surveillance. Governments are often slow to change. Pressures from industry to maintain the status quo and a general reluctance to allocate new funds for effective regulatory functions have historically combined to produce a drug regulatory environment that has too often failed to protect consumer interest. These are not new dynamics—it took the introduction of more than 140 pure food and drug bills in the U.S. Congress, over the course of 30 years, before the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612467990">Sutherland, 1940</xref>). As with OxyContin, media attention and notable public harms have often been the required catalyst for revisions to the regulatory system. During the 1 week in 1937 that a medication called Elixir Sulfanilamide was available, 105 of the 353 patients who tried the medication died. This tragedy led to the passage of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612467990">Ballentine, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612467990">Hawthorne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612467990">Wax, 1995</xref>). Likewise, the medical tragedies associated with the drug Thalidomide proved to be the final catalyst for the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1962 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612467990">Hawthorne, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering OxyContin is a safe and effective medication when it is used as prescribed, it is perhaps unfair to associate the drug with either Elixir Sulfanilamide or Thalidomide. As in those cases, however, it was a public furor fueled by media coverage that allowed the OxyContin case to serve as a catalyst for substantial changes to the regulatory system. In this case, the changes affect the public–private abuse liability assessment system, particularly in the period after the drugs are marketed. The relatively quick removal of Palladone from the pharmaceutical market suggests that the FDA may be more willing to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable when these products have design defects. Moreover, risk-management plans have emerged out of privately funded initiatives. The RADARS system, developed by Purdue Pharma, built on another privately developed system (the Ultram case) and evolved into a strict FDA-mandated requirement that pharmaceutical companies must meet prior to drug approval. In addition, problems associated with drug abuse and diversion have led to the creation of the Harold Rodgers program, which has encouraged many states to implement prescription-monitoring programs. Although a precise retrospective accounting of OxyContin-related harm may remain elusive, the OxyContin experience has become a valuable case study in how regulatory systems evolve and, in some ways, demonstrates the conditions under which concrete and positive changes might be made.</p>
