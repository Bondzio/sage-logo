<abstract>
<p>This article examines the downsides of social capital (networks of citizens) for women affected by disasters, an issue little understood in the public administration literature. Studying this issue is important due to women’s unique vulnerabilities and resilience in the face of disasters. Based on the case study of the epicenter of the August 17, 1999, earthquake in Turkey (in-depth interviews, participatory site observation, a focus group, and review of secondary sources), this article suggests that despite its benefits, social capital has its downsides. It helps perpetuate gender-based assumptions and could put women in conflict with the state authorities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since political scientist Robert Putnam’s <italic>Making Democracy Work</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399712471491">Putnam, Leonardi, &amp; Nanetti, 1993</xref>) and <italic>Bowling Alone</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399712471491">1995</xref>), the concept of social capital has gained much popularity across the disciplines. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0095399712471491">Woolcock and Narayan (2000)</xref> suggested, the concept has helped to “bridge orthodox divides among scholars, practitioners, and policymakers” (p. 225). Social capital has also received considerable attention in the public administration discipline. Many public administration scholars have called for the need to take into account the role of social capital in areas ranging from public sector reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399712471491">Gregory, 1999</xref>) to performance management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0095399712471491">Wichowsky &amp; Moynihan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Social capital discourse in public administration is structured around three themes. The <italic>first</italic> theme has to do with how social capital is created, maintained, or destroyed in the public realm. Scholars of this theme define social capital as cooperative norms (e.g., trust) and argue that the government could create or maintain social capital through policy networks and/or public–private partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399712471491">Erridge &amp; Greer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399712471491">Leach, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399712471491">Lubell &amp; Fulton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0095399712471491">Wallis &amp; Dollery, 2002</xref>). This is because these networks or partnerships allow for repeated interaction between the actors involved, thereby enhancing trust among them. This is not always the case, however. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399712471491">B. Brewer and Hayllar (2005)</xref> suggest that the nature of public–private partnerships could also destroy social capital (e.g., in cases when there is lack of transparency).</p>
<p>The <italic>second</italic> theme of the discourse in public administration is related to the social capital of public servants. In this theme, the emphasis is on the civic attitudes and behavior of individuals as a key element of social capital. These studies mainly examine the differences between public servants and other citizens in terms of their civic attitudes and behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399712471491">G. A. Brewer (2003)</xref>, for instance, finds that public servants are more “civic-minded” than other citizens. His study suggests that being employed by the federal, state, or local government is a predictor of an individual’s participation in civic life.</p>
<p>The <italic>third</italic> theme relates to the consequences of social capital for public administration. Most of the studies that deal with this theme focus on the benefits of social capital. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0095399712471491">Pautz and Schnitzer (2008)</xref> argue that social capital resulting from more interaction between environmental compliance inspectors and the public could contribute to a more effective environmental policy-making and implementation in the United States. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0095399712471491">Shim and Eom (2009)</xref> note that social capital can help fight corruption by increasing the chances of exposing corrupt behavior of public servants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0095399712471491">Steane and Walker (2000)</xref> argue that social capital could enhance efficiency in public procurement (e.g., by lowering the transaction costs).</p>
<p>This article contributes to the third theme on social capital and public administration by examining the consequences of social capital in the context of disasters. In line with studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0095399712471491">Pautz and Schnitzer (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0095399712471491">Shim and Eom (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0095399712471491">Steane and Walker (2000)</xref>, earlier studies on disasters highlight the benefits of social capital for disaster management. Based on his study of September 11, 2001 World Trade Center disaster, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399712471491">Kapucu (2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399712471491">2006b</xref>) argues that predisaster social capital contributes to a more efficient emergency response as it promotes collaboration between the agencies (e.g., public and nonprofit). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399712471491">Kiefer and Montjoy (2006)</xref> attribute the successful evacuation of the mobile population in New Orleans (e.g., those who had cars) before Hurricane Katrina to the preexistence of a disaster management network before the disaster.</p>
<p>Although the studies that examine the consequences of social capital in the context of disasters offer interesting insights, they have two main shortcomings. <italic>First</italic>, they fail to acknowledge that social capital is not always a public good.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095399712471491">1</xref></sup> It can also be used for harmful ends. Therefore, there is a need to have a more comprehensive understanding of social capital in the context of disasters. Without such understanding, public servants will not be able to develop corrective policies to eliminate or reduce the negative consequences of social capital to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters. <italic>Second</italic>, existing studies on social capital and disasters focus mainly on organizational networks (i.e., networks of public sector organizations) rather than on the networks of citizens. As emphasized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399712471491">R. Denhardt and Denhardt’s (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399712471491">J. Denhardt and Denhardt’s (2007)</xref> New Public Service approach, the primary role of the public servant is not to steer but to serve the people. To better serve people, there is a need to better understand the networks that help the people help themselves.</p>
<p>To fill in these gaps in the public administration literature on disasters and social capital, I ask the following question in this article: What downsides, if any, does social capital (defined as civic networks) have for women who are affected by disasters? The focus of the article is on women due to their unique vulnerabilities (e.g., limited access to formal relief and recovery mechanisms) and resilience (e.g., playing an active role in relief and recovery) in the face of disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712471491">Anderson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399712471491">Enarson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399712471491">Morrow &amp; Enarson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0095399712471491">Neumayer &amp; Plümper, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0095399712471491">Oxfam International, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The article is based on the case study of the city of Gölcük, the epicenter of the August 17, 1999 earthquake in Turkey. Following the earthquake, several formal and informal civic networks were established in Gölcük. In another article, I argued that these networks indeed offered benefits for women during disaster recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399712471491">Ganapati, 2012</xref>): They were therapeutic in nature, and they helped women survivors gain empowerment, attain civic consciousness, and avoid the stigma of charity. In this article, drawing upon in-depth interviews, participatory site observation, a focus group, and review of secondary sources, I argue that despite its benefits, social capital also had its downsides in Gölcük. It helped perpetuate gender-based assumptions and put women in conflict with the state authorities.</p>
<p>The rest of the article is structured in the following way: In the next section, I provide a brief overview of the relevant literature on social capital, gender, and disasters. Then, I outline my research setting and methods. Next, I explain the downsides of social capital for women during postdisaster recovery of Gölcük. I conclude with the policy implications of this research and a summary of future directions for research.</p>

<title>Social Capital and Gender in Disaster Recovery</title>
<p>This article builds on social capital, disaster, and gender literatures. Although there is no consensus on what social capital is, in general, social capital is defined by two components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399712471491">Hooghe &amp; Stolle, 2003</xref>). The first is the <italic>attitudinal</italic> component. This component comprises norms, values, and understandings that enable collective action, such as trust and reciprocity. The second is the <italic>structural</italic> component. This component includes formal or informal civic networks that enable collective action. In this article, I define social capital as a relational asset that allows one to achieve certain individual or collective ends through formal and/or informal networks that he or she belongs to.</p>
<p>The evergrowing volume of the social capital literature has been subjected to much criticism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399712471491">Bebbington, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399712471491">Das, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399712471491">DeFilippis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0095399712471491">Portes, 1998</xref>). In this article, I focus on two main criticisms. The <italic>first criticism</italic> is that the social capital literature focuses almost exclusively on the benefits of social capital, also reflected in public administration literature as explained before. Studies across the disciplines suggest that social capital produces benefits ranging from reduced susceptibility of individuals to common colds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399712471491">Cohen, Doyle, Skoner, Rabin, &amp; Gwaltney, 1997</xref>) and lessened vulnerability of poor households to crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399712471491">Moser, 1996</xref>) to enhanced public safety in neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399712471491">Ferguson &amp; Mindel, 2007</xref>) and economic growth of nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399712471491">Knack &amp; Keefer, 1997</xref>). However, this feel-good version of the social capital literature tells only part of the story. Even mafia and gangs, for instance, rely on social capital to pursue their ends (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399712471491">Gambetta, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0095399712471491">Pih, De La Rosa, Rugh, &amp; Mao, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399712471491">Rubio, 1997</xref>). Such social capital may offer certain benefits to the members (e.g., monetary benefits) but is undoubtedly harmful to the greater public. By focusing on social capital’s downsides for women during disaster recovery, this article adopts a critical view of social capital.</p>
<p>The <italic>second criticism</italic> of the social capital literature has to do with its consideration of gender. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399712471491">Molyneux (2002</xref>, p. 177), gender is “present and absent in troubling ways” in the social capital literature. Gender is present in “troubling ways” because the literature reveals certain assumptions about the gender roles, especially in its explanations of how social capital is created, maintained or destroyed (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399712471491">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399712471491">Coleman, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399712471491">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399712471491">Putnam, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095399712471491">2000</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399712471491">Putnam (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095399712471491">2000</xref>) mentions women’s increasing participation in the labor market as one of the possible reasons for decline of social capital in the United States since the 1960s. Gender is also absent in “troubling ways” because the literature turns a blind eye to the kinds of networks women may belong to (e.g., informal networks of kinship or friendship; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399712471491">R. Edwards, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399712471491">Lowndes, 2000</xref>), which could play instrumental roles in community development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399712471491">Armitage &amp; Jameson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399712471491">Jacka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399712471491">Lind, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399712471491">Odurukwe, Asiabaka, Ugwoke, Ehirim, &amp; Ejiogu-Okereke, 2007</xref>). It also does not pay enough attention to the relationships of power within the household (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399712471491">Bebbington, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095399712471491">Mayoux, 2001</xref>) or within the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0095399712471491">Silvey &amp; Elmhirst, 2002</xref>). This article incorporates the gender dimension in social capital by examining the gender-based assumptions and issues of power within networks that Gölcük’s women survivors belonged to in the aftermath of the earthquake.</p>
<p>As with the social capital literature, disaster literature has paid very little attention to social capital’s downsides. Most studies on disasters highlight the benefits of social capital for disaster preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation phases. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399712471491">Dynes (2002)</xref> points out the importance of social capital for evacuation decisions during the preparedness phase as well as for saving lives during the response phase. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399712471491">Brouwer and Nhassengo (2006)</xref> suggest that social capital played an important role in recovery of poor households after the 2000 floods in the Mabalane District (Mozambique). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0095399712471491">Nakagawa and Shaw (2004)</xref> argue that social capital fostered a successful and speedy recovery in communities following the 1995 Kobe (Japan) and 2001 Gujarat (India) earthquakes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712471491">Aldrich (2011)</xref> contends that social capital better predicted disaster recovery (e.g., in terms of population) than earthquake damage, population density, human capital, or economic capital in post-1923 Kanto earthquake in Tokyo (Japan). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399712471491">Hawkins and Maurer (2010)</xref> note that social capital not only helped the survivors of Hurricane Katrina survive the storm but also relocate and rebuild their lives and revitalize their communities. With respect to the mitigation phase, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0095399712471491">Wisner (2003)</xref> suggests that social capital could help reduce the vulnerabilities of megacities (e.g., Mexico City, Los Angeles, Manila, and Tokyo).</p>
<p>Studies that go beyond social capital’s benefits and pay attention to its downsides in the disaster literature include those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399712471491">Buckland and Rahman (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399712471491">Aldrich and Crook (2008)</xref>. The former study found that although communities with higher levels of social capital were better prepared for and responded more effectively to the 1997 Red River Flood in Manitoba (Canada), such communities also faced more resistance to timely evacuation. The latter study highlighted how social capital united disaster victims for collective action in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, but, at the same time, it hindered important projects that are controversial yet perhaps necessary for a speedy recovery (e.g., such communities resisted trailer parks to temporarily house disaster victims).</p>
<p>With respect to gender, the literature on disasters has increasingly emphasized the need for a gender-sensitive approach (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399712471491">Enarson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399712471491">Fordham, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399712471491">Fothergill, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399712471491">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399712471491">Morrow &amp; Enarson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0095399712471491">Peek &amp; Fothergill, 2008</xref>). Much of the present literature on gender and disasters focuses on the ways in which women are more vulnerable or resilient in the face of disasters. Women’s vulnerabilities are perhaps best highlighted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0095399712471491">Neumayer and Plümper’s (2007)</xref> study of 141 countries over the period 1981 to 2002. According to this study, natural disasters kill more women than men on average (or they kill women at a younger age than men) if the socioeconomic status of women is low in the affected country. Women’s vulnerabilities go beyond the disproportionate impact of disasters. As a group, women face additional barriers in responding to and recovering from disasters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399712471491">Morrow and Enarson’s (1996)</xref> study, for instance, suggests that women were especially vulnerable to exploitation and fraud following the 1992 Hurricane Andrew in south Florida; and they were the last to recover especially when combined with poverty and minority status. Yet, women were also resilient in the face of the disaster, playing active roles during disaster relief and recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399712471491">Morrow &amp; Enarson, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite a growing number of studies on gender and disaster, existing research offers an incomplete picture of the benefits and downsides of social capital for women in preparing for, responding to and recovering from disasters. Because I examined the benefits of social capital for women during disaster recovery in another article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399712471491">Ganapati, 2012</xref>), I focus on the downsides of social capital in this article, specifically on the disadvantages women may have through their membership in formal and/or informal networks in postdisaster contexts. The research question is as follows: What downsides, if any, does social capital have for women who are affected by disasters?</p>
<p>In answering this question, this article builds a bridge across social capital, disaster, and gender literatures. Such a bridge is necessary because women are especially vulnerable in the face of disasters as explained above, and social capital constitutes a potential asset that can help women become more resilient in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from disasters. However, one should not assume that social capital is always a “public good,” as often depicted in the public administration, social capital, and disaster literatures. Social capital could also have its negative consequences. Policy makers need to have a better understanding of social capital and its negative consequences for women so that they can develop corrective policies to deal with them as opposed to turning a blind eye to them.</p>

<title>Research Method and Setting</title>
<p>The article is based on a qualitative case study of the postearthquake recovery of the city of Gölcük in Turkey. The qualitative approach is important because there is lack of “theoretically informed case analyses” in the social capital literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399712471491">B. Edwards &amp; Foley, 1998</xref>, p. 136). The approach is also appropriate because the article’s purpose is not to generalize but to examine the deeper dynamics of the consequences of social capital for women in the postearthquake recovery. These consequences can be captured best when studied in particular contexts, specifically by focusing on the networks that women belong to, which are often invisible in the literature.</p>
<p>Gölcük was the epicenter of the August 17, 1999 earthquake (7.4 magnitude), which claimed more than 17,000 lives and damaged approximately 250,000 housing and business units in Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399712471491">Prime Minister’s Office-Crisis Management Center [PMO-CMC], 2000</xref>). Its population was 55,790 in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0095399712471491">State Institute of Statistics, 2002</xref>). The August 17 earthquake particularly hit the city and the district of Gölcük hard. About 37% of all housing units in the city of Gölcük were fully destroyed by the earthquake, and one third of overall death toll (5,383 people) was from the district of Gölcük alone.</p>
<p>The city of Gölcük provides an opportunity for research on the downsides of the structural components social capital because 10 formal and informal civic networks (structural components of social capital) emerged in Gölcük following the earthquake. Some of these networks were designed exclusively for and/or by women, whereas others were more inclusive in terms of their target group and membership. The civic networks that emerged in Gölcük could be categorized into four main types based on their purpose: (a) <italic>place-based community organizations</italic>, which addressed the needs of territorial communities (e.g., the city and the neighborhood), and whose main focus was to have a say in the recovery of Gölcük and its neighborhoods; (b) <italic>search and rescue teams</italic>, which were established to save lives as well as to provide logistic and psychological support in areas affected by disasters (within Turkey and abroad); (c) <italic>income-generating networks</italic>, which helped provide jobs (e.g., a women’s cooperative whose goal was to help women, especially those who lost the breadwinners in their households, to generate income by sewing and making candles); and (d) <italic>aid networks</italic>, which provided financial or other support to those who were most disadvantaged in postearthquake recovery (e.g., women, children, elderly, and the handicapped). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095399712471491">Table 1</xref> lists the networks according to these categories.

<p>Primary data collection method for the study was in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 69 participants. The interviews took place in 2001 to 2002, followed by a second round of interviews in 2009. During the 2001 to 2002 fieldwork, the author stayed in a prefabricated area in Gölcük, living among the survivors who were displaced by the earthquake (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095399712471491">Figure 1</xref> below for a picture of the prefabricated housing area). Interviews were conducted in Turkish in the government offices, offices of civic networks, earthquake survivors’ homes, and other locations convenient to the interviewees (e.g., coffee shops). Of the 69 study participants, 40 were earthquake survivors who were actively involved in the above-mentioned civic networks, 28 were policy makers, and the remaining 1 participant was a local historian.</p>

</fig>
<p>The study participants were initially identified through content review of the daily postearthquake editions of a local newspaper (<italic>Gölcük Haber</italic>), participant observation, and/or through visits to governmental offices. The sample was expanded using the snowball technique. The interviews were concluded upon reaching “theoretical saturation,” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399712471491">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>), that is, when additional interviews did not add anything new to the knowledge gained from previous interviews.</p>
<p>The final sample for the study was diverse. The ages of the study participants ranged from 18 to 74 years. Although some had a graduate degree, others were illiterate. Twenty-seven participants (18 earthquake survivors and 9 policy makers) were women, and several of male participants were part of civic networks that had an exclusive focus on women as a target group (e.g., Bulat network). The earthquake survivors who participated in the study were from the above-mentioned formal or informal place-based community organizations, search and rescue teams, income-generating networks, and aid networks. Policy makers were either elected (8) or appointed (20). They were distributed across different levels, including the neighborhood, local, district, and central levels as well as international donors (e.g., World Bank) that were involved in the postdisaster recovery of Gölcük.</p>
<p>The interviews with earthquake survivors included questions on their demographics, pre- and postdisaster housing situation, participation in disaster-recovery processes, and involvement in civic networks. The interviews with policy makers included questions on their professional background, responsibilities during disaster recovery, perceptions of the civic networks, efforts to involve them and the broader public in recovery processes, and the challenges they faced while undertaking their responsibilities. For the most part, the interviews were audio-recorded with the informed consent of participants. In cases when the participants did not feel comfortable with the audio-recording (mostly policy makers), notes were taken during the interviews. The interviews were transcribed word-for-word in Turkish and the transcripts were then coded for themes and patterns. Exemplary quotes were selected and translated into English for presentation in the manuscript.</p>
<p>In addition to the interviews, following data collection methods were used for the study: (a) participant observation (over a period of 6.5 months) to see the events in context and understand their routines and everyday lives of those affected by the earthquake and of policy makers (e.g., by attending various events held by the government and the civic networks, such as public meetings, street protests, annual commemoration events, signature campaigns, fund-raising events, and daily training sessions of search and rescue teams); (b) a focus group with representatives from seven neighborhoods of Gölcük (heads of neighborhoods called “<italic>muhtar</italic>” or their assistants) toward the completion of fieldwork to corroborate study findings from the in-depth interviews and participant observation; and (c) review of secondary sources, including the daily editions of a local newspaper in Gölcük (<italic>Gölcük Haber</italic>) and a national newspaper (<italic>Milliyet</italic>) on an everyday basis as well as documents published by the government, international agencies, and the civic networks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399712471491">Ganapati, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399712471491">2009</xref>, for more information on the methods).</p>

<title>Downside of Social Capital for Women During Recovery</title>
<p>In another article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399712471491">Ganapati, 2012</xref>), I argued that the civic networks that were established in Gölcük after the earthquake did offer a few benefits for women. First, the ensuing social capital was therapeutic in nature, helping women leave behind the psychological scars of the earthquake. Second, social capital empowered women and helped them attain civic consciousness. Third, it helped women avoid the stigma of charity while recovering from the earthquake. In this article, I argue for a more holistic picture of social capital by focusing on the downsides of social capital for women. I suggest that social capital helped perpetuate gender-based assumptions through the division of labor in civic networks and through media’s portrayal of teary-eyed women in Gölcük. It also put women at odds with the state authorities. Each of these is explained below.</p>
<sec id="section5-0095399712471491">
<title>Perpetuation of Gender-Based Assumptions Within the Networks</title>
<p>As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0095399712471491">Silvey and Elmhirst (2002)</xref>, there is a need to study the gendered division of labor within civic networks to have a more thorough understanding of social capital. This is especially important in patriarchal societies like Turkey, where stereotypes about the role of women in society continue to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399712471491">Arat, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399712471491">Erman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399712471491">Kandiyoti, 1988</xref>). Turkish women received their political and civil rights in the early 1930s, even ahead of some Western societies. Yet, eight decades later, they continue to face barriers in Turkish society. These barriers are most evident in Turkey’s ranking in the 2010 Global Gender Gap Report. According to this report, the country ranks 126th among 134 countries in the world in terms of gender inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399712471491">Hausmann, Tyson, &amp; Zahidi, 2010</xref>). Only Morocco, Benin, Saudi Arabia, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Pakistan, Chad, and Yemen rank lower than Turkey. Several other studies also reveal gender gaps in Turkey across the sectors, such as health, education, and politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0095399712471491">Şenol, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0095399712471491">World Bank, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the gender gaps in Turkey, women were actively involved in Gölcük’s civic networks. They held leadership positions in half of these networks. Their participation in certain networks, however, did not come easy. The search and rescue teams particularly presented additional barriers for them because the tasks undertaken by these teams are traditionally considered as masculine tasks.</p>
<p>It is important to contextualize the establishment of search and rescue teams in Gölcük after the earthquake before explaining the barriers women faced before and after joining these teams. Having lived through a tragic disaster, earthquake survivors in Gölcük, both men and women, were motivated to save the lives of those who are affected by disasters, as expressed by members of all search and rescue teams in the interviews. They understood how it is like to be in the shoes of other disaster victims. A quote from a male member of the search and rescue team of Gölcük Search and Rescue Association (GESOTİM) illustrates their empathy with disaster victims elsewhere as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the past, when we saw [on TV] Erzincan, Van, Tatvan, Afyon, or Adana [areas hit by earthquakes in Turkey], we would say “vah, vah, vah” [an expression of sadness] and move on to another [TV] channel. Now we can’t do that. We now say that let’s not watch the [music channels on TV such as] King TV or Music TV. Our ears open up if we hear the [word] earthquake . . . They [people hit by disasters] are in the same situation with us. They live through the same things.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By the term <italic>same things</italic>, this search and rescue team member was referring to the dire conditions they experienced after the earthquake. After the tremor, those who managed to survive were surrounded by those who were trapped underneath the collapsed buildings, wailing, and begging to be saved. They worked day and night to save the lives of such souls with their bare hands and sometimes by “breaking stones with stones” in the words of an interviewee. Although they saved many lives, the voices of those trapped underneath slowly faded as the days passed, leaving a lingering smell on their furniture, and even in their soaps, behind. In some ways, the people of Gölcük do not want to forget the initial days of the earthquake because it is these days that motivated them to be part of the search and rescue teams. A female member of another search and rescue team, Civil Defense Volunteers (CDV), explained this commonly shared sentiment among search and rescue team members as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>[I saw] a boy crying in his pajamas near the debris [she cries]. He had put both his hands on his head. There was no one there. His wailing of “Mother! Father!” still affects me now. This is something which I will never forget. I was really affected by that . . . Then people’s wails and crying in front of the buildings. Their relatives’ digging the debris with their hands . . . I will never forget. I cannot forget. In a way, it is better for me not to forget.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0095399712471491">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although some women were highly motivated to help others who are affected by disasters, they were unsure of how their participation in search and rescue teams will be viewed by others, including by their family members. One female interviewee from the search and rescue team called MAG-DER said that she thought “no family will send women” to join such a team. Because of such thinking, she initially hesitated to put her name down for the team but eventually wanted to give it a try and joined the team. Participation of women in Gölcük’s search and rescue teams snowballed one by one. As a female member from GESOTİM noted, it was “easier to bring in other women” after the first woman signed up for the team. This was because “in places where there are men, women do not enter. What happened [after one woman joined]? Women multiplied.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0095399712471491">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although women were able to break the barriers to join the search and rescue teams, they faced new barriers within the teams, which exhibited a gendered division of labor. Because search and rescue are typically considered as masculine tasks, they were mostly undertaken by men in the teams. The roles of women were mostly limited to providing first aid and psychological support to those affected by disasters due to the assumption that women are good for tasks that require emotive work (as opposed to physical work). One female interviewee from GESOTİM, another search and rescue team, said that all they could do in a disaster event was to offer moral support to the girls who had lost their possessions, including their <italic>çeyiz</italic> (dotal property). In many ways, women enjoyed working behind the scenes and attending to the needs of disaster victims. As highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712471491">Carol Gilligan’s (1998)</xref> seminal work titled <italic>In a Different Voice</italic>, women define their identity in the context of their relationships with others. In addition, they are motivated by an ethic of responsibility that “rests on an understanding that gives rise to compassion and care” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712471491">Gilligan, 1998</xref>, p. 165). However, the gendered division of labor within the teams helped perpetuate the gender-based assumptions.</p>

<title>Stereotypical Representation of Women in Media With the Help of Civic Networks</title>
<p>Scholars suggest that women, along with other groups (e.g., minorities, poor, and children), are often depicted in media in more negative terms (e.g., passive and helpless rather than resilient and resourceful) than others following disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0095399712471491">Spriggs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0095399712471491">Tierney, Bevc, &amp; Kuligowski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0095399712471491">Voorhes, Vick, &amp; Perkins, 2007</xref>). In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399712471491">Enarson and Meyreles (2004)</xref>, “[w]omen are all too often represented as the universal disaster victim—tearful, beleaguered, and overwhelmed—while men are denied emotion but depicted as sturdy and resourceful” (pp. 49-50). The Gölcük case offers supporting insights of how social capital, in the form of civic networks, helped reinforce such stereotypical representation of women in media following disasters.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the August 17, 1999 earthquake, both national and local media outlets (e.g., 41 TV, Özgür Kocaeli) paid close attention to Gölcük and its recovery although the interest from the national outlets started to wane about a year after the earthquake (except during the anniversaries of the earthquake). The leaders of civic networks appreciated the attention they received from the media. They were well aware that the media could increase the visibility of their networks, carry their message to the decision makers, and help them mobilize public support for their activities. Besides, the media provided them a platform to voice their hopes and frustrations about the recovery process. Because of these benefits, they collaborated with the media on a continuing basis.</p>
<p>The collaboration between the civic networks and the media, however, came at a price: It reinforced the assumptions of women as being weak. Because the media representatives were interested in getting higher ratings, they explicitly requested the networks to send some teary-eyed women to their programs. One of the female members from the place-based community organization of Gölcük Solidarity Association (GSA) explained how media representatives threatened to drop their stories unless they got what they wanted:
<disp-quote>
<p>TV producers prepare programs where they want to see the tears of the earthquake victims. If there is no mournful story, he [the producer] does not even care about you . . . For instance, he [the producer] tells me to send mourning women . . . He says that he wants women who will cry and mourn . . . Otherwise, he does not come to cover the story. We have to [accede to their requests] so that we can make our voice heard.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Media representatives did not only insist on putting “crying women” in front of their cameras but also caused emotional trauma to such women. For instance, in one occasion, the media representatives were filming a segment on those whose loved ones went missing after the earthquake. There were many individuals throughout the earthquake zone who did not know whether or not their loved ones were alive. These individuals were trying to convince the Turkish government that there was a problem of missing persons that needed to be addressed. In that sense, their cooperation with the media was essential. In the segment on the missing persons, the media representatives asked some of the mothers to enact how they lost contact with their child. Enacting these scenes was an emotional roller coaster for these mothers. Yet, as a female GSA member explained, the mothers received no remorse from media representatives. The media representatives were content to report the emotional trauma of the mothers:
<disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, they made us go through such things that we never wanted to do, so that those in Ankara [referring to the state authorities] could hear our voice. For instance, [during filming of the segment on missing persons] a woman fell down. She fainted. The cameraman continued to record instead of helping her. We were trying to bring her around. They were happily saying, “Oh, I caught something. This is great.” . . . When I think about the past, I get real mad. I get mad at the reporters, the cameramen, and the press corps for this . . . [When we discuss these issues with them] He [the producer] tells us, “You also use us. I am making your voice heard. What else do you want? . . . Without us, you cannot make your voice heard.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to the same GSA member, the media’s emphasis on crying women had another unintended consequence. It convinced the earthquake victims (including males) that they have to cry to be heard by the authorities and to get things done, not only in front of the media but also in front of state authorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0095399712471491">4</xref></sup> This was true even they asked for things that were entitled to (e.g., permanent housing units for those whose homes were destroyed or heavily damaged from the earthquake). She explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>They made people get used to this [crying] . . . S/he [the earthquake survivor] knows that they [the authorities] probably would not take you seriously [if you do not cry] . . . Although we or I do not believe this, I need to act this way at the ministry because [I feel that] I do not have any other choice . . . If you go as a regular citizen [to the authorities] and ask for something you are entitled to . . . you do not need to cry for this. But s/he [the earthquake survivor] knows that if s/he does not cry, the official is not going to solve his/her issue. S/he would need to give a bribe.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In short, civic networks in Gölcük helped the media recruit teary-eyed women because the networks needed the media’s support to pursue their postearthquake agenda. Recruitment of such women to media programs not only reinforced the stereotypes about women but also put them through emotional trauma. It also affected the way they and others affected by the disaster dealt with the state authorities.</p>

<sec id="section7-0095399712471491">
<title>Conflict With the State Authorities</title>
<p>One of the main characteristics of the political culture of the masses in Turkey is unquestioned loyalty and obedience to state authorities. The Turkish state has traditionally been strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399712471491">Heper, 1985</xref>) and has been considered as a paternal figure that should “provide for, look after, and protect” Turkish citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399712471491">Dodd, 1979</xref>, p. 70). The roots of this tradition date back to the Ottoman Empire, during which the Sultan was held responsible personally for the welfare of the ruled, and the ruled were obliged to show full respect and obedience to their “Father,” the Sultan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399712471491">Mardin, 1969</xref>). With the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, the Turkish state replaced the sultan as a paternal figure, as expressed in such folk expressions as <italic>Devlet Baba</italic> (Father State) and <italic>memleket cocukları</italic> (children of the nation).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399712471491">Kalaycıoğlu (2002)</xref> suggests that such loyalty and obedience to authority in Turkey manifests itself in its citizens’ reluctance to participate in protests or exhibit civil obedience. According to the “World Values Survey” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399712471491">Inglehart, Basanez, &amp; Moreno, 1998</xref>), for instance, 77% of Turkish people are reluctant to join a boycott. Due to such high percentage, Turkey ranks as the fourth from the bottom (above Hungary, Chile, and Argentina) with respect to willingness of the people to join a boycott among the 39 countries surveyed.</p>
<p>Despite the reluctance of Turkish people to clash with authority, members of civic networks in Gölcük participated in several protests after the earthquake because their trust in the Turkish state was shaken. The August 17, 1999 earthquake had revealed how unprepared the strong “Father State” was to a major disaster. For instance, when the earthquake hit, the state’s earthquake fund, one of the three major disaster funds in Turkey at the time, had the equivalent of US$2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399712471491"><italic>Milliyet</italic>, 1999a</xref>). The Turkish state authorities were missing from the earthquake zone in the initial days of the earthquake. The state’s search and rescue teams as well as the Red Crescent Society (Turkish counterpart of Red Cross) had reportedly reached the earthquake zone after some foreign teams and the International Red Cross had (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399712471491"><italic>Milliyet</italic>, 1999b</xref>).</p>
<p>People of Gölcük also lost their trust in the state due to its other mistakes before and after the earthquake. Prior to the earthquake, the state had failed to enforce the existing building codes in earthquake-prone areas, allowing contractors to indirectly pilfer construction materials, and erect flimsy buildings, which became tombs for thousands in the earthquake. Following the earthquake, the state had discarded the rubble from the collapsed buildings without separating the cement, iron, furniture, or the human bodies. One could see the “pieces of arms and legs” in the wreckage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0095399712471491">Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects, 2000</xref>, p. 12). Furthermore, state officials had undertaken damage assessment activities in Gölcük in a questionable way (e.g., by assessing of the damage in housing stock simply by walking the streets rather than by conducting structural tests of the buildings).</p>
<p>The people of Gölcük were fed up with the state in the aftermath of the earthquake. They no longer wanted to show unquestioned loyalty and obedience to the authority of the state. Some networks took their cases to streets to protest the pre- and postearthquake policies of the state. Through these protests, women members of these networks had to clash with the state authorities, perhaps for the first time in their lives. In one occasion, right before an anniversary of the earthquake, members of the place-based community organization of GSA were conducting a protest to highlight their needs, especially in terms of housing, jobs, and food. Even though they received permission from the state authorities to conduct the protest and to use certain slogans, they were threatened to be detained by the police during the protest. Their peaceful protests and advocacy activities were interrupted because of a simple clerical error on a poster. A female member of GSA explained this as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>On the posters, it says: “I want my house, food, and job.” We had the permission [from the district office to display the poster] . . . For the first time, I came face to face with the state . . . [The police] said, “You do not have the permission.” [I told him that] we do have the permission. The district government gave us the permission. He [the police] said that it [the poster] read “I want my house, job, and food [instead of <italic>my house, food, and job</italic>].” This was a clerical error. He [the police officer] says, “This one does not say the same thing.” For this, he tries to take you into custody. I cannot describe you how much pressure they are trying to put. We saw so much pressure, which we had not seen throughout our lives.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clashing with the state authorities was rather traumatic for women, especially for those who had no prior experience in civic networks before the earthquake. The lives of these women revolved mostly around their homes. As one woman indicated, before the earthquake, she used to be “a person who would go from school to house and back, from work to home and back.” She did not know how to “fight” for her rights. She even used to sympathize with the police, with whom she had to come face-to-face after the earthquake.</p>

<title>Dealing With the Downside of Social Capital</title>
<p>This article aimed to answer the following question: What downsides, if any, does social capital (defined as civic networks) have for women who are affected by disasters? The case study of Gölcük, the epicenter of the August 17, 1999 earthquake, suggested that social capital is not always an unproblematic “public good” in postdisaster contexts. Although it may offer some benefits for women in such contexts (e.g., psychological support, empowerment, civic consciousness, and avoiding the stigma of charity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399712471491">Ganapati, 2012</xref>), it may also help perpetuate gender-based assumptions, such as women being good enough only for tasks that require emotive work (as opposed to physical work involved in search and rescue tasks) and women having teary eyes. In the case of Gölcük, such assumptions were evident in intranetwork division of labor and in media’s dealings with the civic networks. In addition, the social capital had another downside for women who were part of the civic networks: It brought them face-to-face with the state authorities for the first time in their lives, subjecting them to enormous pressure from the police. Although this may be an essential component of participating in civic life, it was rather stressful for women.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Gölcük case study was not to generalize its findings on social capital and gender to other contexts. However, the study suggests that there is a need for gender-awareness building in postdisaster contexts. Such awareness could be achieved through capacity-building initiatives that target different groups ranging from members of civic networks themselves to media representatives and state authorities (e.g., the police). The initiatives that target the members of civic networks could focus on how to increase women’s participation in civic networks that are traditionally considered as networks of men (e.g., search and rescue teams), how to assess women’s needs within the networks, how to examine power relationships within the networks, and how to empower women within the networks. The initiatives that target the media representatives could address how to assess and address gender stereotyping in their reporting and how to build trust with the networks that women may belong to. Finally, the initiatives that target the public servants could focus on how to build trust with the networks that women may belong to. They could also introduce alternative dispute resolution techniques to public servants.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite an ever-growing number of studies on social capital in the public administration literature, our knowledge on the downsides of social capital remains limited. The studies that use the social capital framework almost exclusively focus on its benefits for policy making and implementation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399712471491">Kapucu, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399712471491">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399712471491">Kiefer &amp; Montjoy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0095399712471491">Shim &amp; Eom, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0095399712471491">Steane &amp; Walker, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, these studies pay minimal attention to the networks of citizens. They focus more on organizational networks of public sector agencies. This article aimed to fill in these gaps in the literature by highlighting the downsides of social capital for women affected by disasters, specifically perpetuation of gender-based assumptions and placing women in conflict with the state authorities.</p>
<p>This study highlights several directions for future research on social capital. First, as public administration scholars, we need to pay much more attention to the networks of citizens. Although our focus on networks of public sector agencies is understandable, we no longer can ignore that public servants are there to “serve” the people rather than to “steer” them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399712471491">Denhardt and Denhardt, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399712471491">2007</xref>). Civic networks of citizens, like the ones that were established in Gölcük after the earthquake, also have the same goal: to serve the people. A better understanding of the networks of citizens will help us better achieve our <italic>collective</italic> goal of “serving” the people.</p>
<p>Second, we need more studies that examine the downsides of social capital. Although social capital may offer benefits for individuals, households, organizations, and nations, as revealed by the extensive literature on social capital (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399712471491">Cohen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399712471491">Kapucu, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399712471491">Knack &amp; Keefer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399712471491">Moser, 1996</xref>), it could also have downsides. Studies on mafia and gangs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399712471491">Gambetta, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0095399712471491">Pih et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399712471491">Rubio, 1997</xref>) highlight such downsides. Yet, as the Gölcük case study shows, there is no need to go to the extremes of mafia and gangs. Even the civic networks of earthquake survivors could have some downsides. We need to understand the downsides of social capital at different levels so that we can undertake necessary policy measures to overcome them.</p>
<p>Third, we need to have a more nuanced understanding of the gender dimensions of social capital. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399712471491">Molyneux (2002</xref>, p. 177) argues, gender is both “present” and “absent” in the social capital literature “in troubling ways.” The mainstream social capital literature not only is laden with gender-based assumptions (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399712471491">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399712471491">Coleman, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399712471491">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399712471491">Putnam, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095399712471491">2000</xref>) but also pays minimal attention to the women’s networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399712471491">R. Edwards, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399712471491">Lowndes, 2000</xref>) and to the intranetwork power relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0095399712471491">Silvey &amp; Elmhirst, 2002</xref>). Studying the networks women may belong to and the power relationships within those networks will help us develop gender-sensitive policies in civic life.</p>

<p>This is also true for other studies in public administration that focus on the consequences of social capital. Erridge and Greer’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399712471491">2002</xref>) is an exception because it acknowledges both the benefits and downsides of social capital for public procurement.</p>

<p>This theme of “not forgetting the earthquake” continuously appears in public places in Gölcük. Especially during the anniversary of the earthquake, the survivors and their networks place banners and photos of the earthquake, which read “Unutmadık, Unutturmayacağız!” (“We Did Not Forget. We Will Not Let It Be Forgotten!”) or “Depremi Unuttunuz! Unutturmayacağız.” (“You Forgot the Earthquake! We Will Not Let It Be Forgotten.”).</p>

<p>This was also confirmed during my participant observation among the earthquake survivors. In one occasion, for instance, I personally witnessed a male earthquake victim who came to the GSA’s office and told us that he forced himself to cry in the court to get sympathy from the people.</p>
