<abstract>
<p>Over their lifetime, approximately 10% of all women become victims of postseparation stalking or assault. We use a nationally representative survey of separated Swedish women to examine whether men who strive to control their partners during their relationships are more likely to stalk or assault their ex-partners after separation. The empirical analysis shows that basic measures of control behaviors explain 18% of the variance in stalking victimization and 8% of the assault victimization. Moreover, the predictive values of our measures of control by far surpass those of other common risk markers included in the analysis.</p>

<body>
<p>A key strategy for ending domestic violence is to make it possible for victims to leave their abusers. However, the risk of violence may persist, as underlined by the period after separation that had especially high rates of female victimization to stalking and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801213490560">Häll, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801213490560">Johnson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801213490560">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1998</xref>). In the United States, one million women become victims of stalking by their former partner in any given year, and 8% of all women are stalked at some point in their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801213490560">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 1998</xref>). Stalking victimization also carries high personal and social costs. Besides suffering psychological consequences, such as anxiety, sleep disturbance, and suicidal thoughts, victims are also more likely to abandon work and pull out of social activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801213490560">Hall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801213490560">Pathé &amp; Mullen, 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077801213490560">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the prevalence and severity of postseparation stalking and assault, there is little reliable evidence regarding the predictors of victimization. In this article, we suggest that a history of control behaviors by the abuser is a key predictor of postseparation stalking and assault. This claim is rooted in previous insights from feminist theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801213490560">Kelly, 1988</xref>), and consistent with predictions from evolutionary psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801213490560">Daly &amp; Wilson, 1989</xref>). Empirically, control behaviors have been found to predict the severity and frequency of violence in ongoing violent relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801213490560">Johnson &amp; Leone, 2005</xref>). Our hypothesis can be viewed as an extension of this work, and provides the first thorough empirical investigation of postseparation outcomes from nationally representative survey data.</p>
<p>Our test is carried out in a cross-sectional sample of 714 divorced Swedish couples, surveyed in 2001. The data are from a subsample of the Swedish National Violence Against Women Survey, which altogether provides lifetime violence experiences of a nationally representative sample of 6,926 women. From this survey, we use a subsample of couples where the woman was subjected to one or more acts of violence during cohabitation. Thus we limit the sample to the group of women most at risk of spousal assault after separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801213490560">Kropp &amp; Hart, 2000</xref>), allowing a focus on the potentially important heterogeneity within this group.</p>
<p>The empirical analysis improves substantially on existing research, mainly conducted in the field of sociology. Many studies have pointed out the relevance of specific control behaviors, for example, jealousy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801213490560">Dutton, van Ginkel, &amp; Landolt, 1996</xref>), threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801213490560">Brewster, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801213490560">Rosenfeld, 2004</xref>), or combinations of the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801213490560">Fleury, Sullivan, &amp; Bybee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801213490560">Roberts, 2002</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490560">Block and DeKeseredy (2007)</xref> find a correlation between a count variable for five control behaviors and postseparation sexual assault.</p>
<p>Our study provides several improvements on these earlier studies. Most importantly, these studies have not used any nationally representative survey data. Instead, they have relied on convenience samples—for example, undergraduate college students and women who visit hospitals or who are temporarily residing in women’s shelters—thereby making the results difficult to apply to the general population.</p>
<p>Compared to previous research, we use a more comprehensive measure of control and a more thorough test of the predictive power of control relative to other confounders. Our data set includes information on 10 different control behaviors, thereby making a multidimensional measure of both a linear and nonlinear type possible. In a report on the results from the U.S. National Violence against Women Survey (NVAWS), the various survey items measuring control behaviors display correlations with postseparation stalking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801213490560">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 1998</xref>). These correlations are in line with our hypothesis, but require further statistical tests for unobserved heterogeneity. Previous studies have shown correlations between violence in intimate relationships and the presence of joint children, whether the respondent experienced sexual or physical violence as a child, alcohol and drug abuse, and the respondent’s income level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077801213490560">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>We find a highly systematic pattern in the characteristics of the violent men who continue with stalking and/or violence after their divorce. Men who subjected their wives to control behaviors during the time of cohabitation are heavily overrepresented among the perpetrators of these crimes. Our measure of control behaviors can explain 20% of the variance in the likelihood of stalking, and 11.1% of the likelihood of postseparation assault. As such, the results strongly support the hypothesis that a context of control is an important predictor of violence directed at women by men, as derived from feminist theory and evolutionary psychology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077801213490560">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, our measures of control behaviors are substantially more important as compared to the other confounders introduced in the analysis. This finding is of importance for the development of a risk prevention tool. Our results highlight the fact that questions regarding the control context of the violent relationship are underutilized in the most widely used questionnaires aimed at preventing postseparation abuse (e.g., the Spousal Assault Risk Assessment).</p>
<sec id="section1-1077801213490560">
<title>Theory of Control and Violence in Intimate Relationships</title>
<p>In feminist theory, men’s domination over women in society is viewed as having a reciprocal relationship with men’s violence against women, each reinforcing the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801213490560">Johnson, 1996</xref>). Feminist scholars often point out that the many different theories based on factors such as stress, personality, and substance abuse cannot explain why men are so predominant among perpetrators, and why many specifically focus their violent actions on women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801213490560">Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801213490560">Kelly, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801213490560">Lundgren, 1995</xref>). While it is acknowledged that single-factor explanations for domestic violence are inadequate, male dominance is viewed as the foundation for any realistic theory of domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801213490560">Heise, 1998</xref>). Testable predictions concerning the link from control to violence can be derived from this literature. They range from macro-level statements (e.g., that societies where men have more control over the lives of women should have more domestic violence) to the micro-level, which is of interest here (e.g., that more controlling men should be more—and more dangerously—violent).</p>
<p>Evolutionary psychology has a theoretical departure point that differs greatly from feminist theory. It perceives human behavior as solely driven by biological mechanisms that have achieved reproductive success throughout the history of humankind. Regarding violence against a spouse, evolutionary psychologists argue that mate guarding is an example of such successful behaviors. These behaviors include both control traits with the purpose of increasing detection, and violent acts aimed at securing the exclusivity of one’s mate, driven by <italic>sexual proprietariness</italic>, that is, resentment of wives’ infidelity and efforts to leave a relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801213490560">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1996</xref>). Thus, it is hypothesized that control will co-occur with violence because both form part of the same strategy for mate guarding. Moreover, an increased risk for separation (i.e., an increased need to guard one’s partner) should trigger increases in both nonviolent and violent control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801213490560">Shackelford, Goets, Buss, Euler, &amp; Hoier, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801213490560">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1996</xref>). Although the theoretical underpinnings differ greatly from those of feminist theory, the testable predictions hence concur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801213490560">Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Both feminist theory and evolutionary psychology employ a rational choice perspective on domestic violence by viewing violent acts as a means of controlling one’s partner. Most economic studies focusing on violence in intimate relationships also fall into this category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801213490560">Aizer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801213490560">Farmer &amp; Tiefenthaler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801213490560">Tauchen, Witte, &amp; Long, 1991</xref>). Nevertheless, agreement is not universal. Another strand of literature instead subscribes to the so-called “family violence perspective,” which instead argues that it is a lack, or loss of, control that drives the use of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801213490560">Card &amp; Dahl, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801213490560">MacMillian &amp; Gartner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801213490560">Straus, Gelles, &amp; Smith, 1990</xref>). However, it should be noted that focusing on stress as the immediate trigger of domestic violence does not exclude a contributing role for control as explaining the heterogeneous responses to this loss of control among partners.</p>
<p>Another proposition that partly reconciles the feminist and family violence literatures is that their differing predictions may in fact stem from the study of two different forms of violent relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801213490560">Johnson, 1995</xref>). In studies of data from court cases or women’s shelters, researchers are likely to have oversampled severe forms of deliberate coercive male-driven violence. In contrast, the use of survey data in the family violence literature may have downplayed the role of control by including many relationships characterized by violent arguments in the household. If this categorization is correct, a context of control could distinguish relationships with deliberate, coercive and male-driven violence from those characterized by irrational outbursts of violent acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801213490560">Johnson &amp; Leone, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077801213490560">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Data and Descriptive Statistics</title>
<p>In the empirical analysis, we focus on the postseparation period of marriages and cohabiting relationships. As we use a Swedish sample, and cohabitation is very common and legally on par with marriage in Sweden, we group these two types of relations. Postseparation is defined as the period after divorce and/or ending cohabitation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801213490560">Mahoney (1991)</xref> argues that it is actually the man’s fear that the woman will end the relationship that triggers his escalation of the violence, rather than the physical separation. She defines <italic>separation assault</italic> as an “attack on the woman’s body and volition in which her partner seeks to prevent her from leaving, retaliate for the separation, or force her to return” (p. 65). While acknowledging the theoretical merits of a broader definition, which focuses on the experience of the man rather than the timing of divorce or discontinued cohabitation, our more concrete definition of separation has the advantage of being feasible with large survey studies and registry data, and therefore makes our results directly applicable for policy analysis.</p>
<p>Our data come from a survey of violence against women administered by Statistics Sweden in 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801213490560">Lundgren, Heimer, Westerstrand, &amp; Kalliokoski, 2001</xref>), which followed the example set by Statistics Canada in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801213490560">Johnson, 1996</xref>). The survey contains rich information on various forms of violence, threats, and control behaviors from intimate partners. It also contains variables that capture the relationship history of each respondent. In addition to information on postseparation assault, we know whether the respondent has been subjected to any of three forms of stalking: (a) threats, face-to-face or over the telephone; (b) unwanted visits; and (c) being waited for, followed around, or waylaid. For most of the analysis, we combine the three stalking variables into a composite variable denoted <italic>stalking</italic>. This variable takes the value of 1 for women who have been victims of threats, unwanted visits, or being followed around or waylaid.</p>
<p>Postseparation stalking and violence are specifically measured for the most recent relationship with a violent partner, while control behaviors are measured for <italic>any</italic> ex-husband. Therefore, we restrict the sample to women with no more than one ex-partner. We also remove women who have not experienced at least one act of violence by their partners, and who were not asked the follow-up questions about postseparation outcomes, leaving a final sample size of 739 women. Finally, we remove a small number of women for whom we cannot exclude that exposure to “any violence” took place (at least) before separation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077801213490560">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The confounding variables are created as follows. Substance abuse by either the victim or the abuser is captured by dummy variables taking the value of 1 if either person used alcohol at least “2-3 times a week” or drugs at least “once a week.” A dummy variable capturing the relative country of origin of the man vis-à-vis the woman is set to 1 if (a) the man is Swedish or from a “Western” country, while the woman is an immigrant from a non-Western country, or (b) if the man is Swedish, while the woman is from any other country. Another dummy variable indicating a power advantage of the ex-husband in terms of education is set to 1 if the man has attained a higher educational category than the woman. Here, education is categorized as (a) university studies with or without having obtained a degree, (b) secondary schooling, or (c) compulsory schooling or less. Income, including salary, sickness benefits, pensions, student grants, and unemployment benefits, is measured by dummies for five categories, matching those available to the respondent in the survey. Finally, we include a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if the respondent does not hold a wage-earning job.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801213490560">Table 1</xref>. Half of the women in our sample have been victims of some form of stalking and 10% have experienced assault at the hands of their ex-partners. Furthermore, we see that 58% of the women have joint children with their ex-husband and that 36% of the husbands consumed alcohol and/or drugs on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The level of control is measured through 10 specific control behaviors. Their occurrences in the sample are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801213490560">Table 2</xref>. More than half of the respondents have experienced jealousy, being called disparaging names, and being made to feel inferior and useless. The less common behaviors include restrictions on the respondents’ social and working life. Despite the fact that the specific combination of control tactics varies from one controlling partner to another, we argue that the behaviors form part of conjoint strategies of sexual coercion, where it is mainly the average level of coercion that varies between perpetrators. The important heterogeneity in control behaviors could then be captured by a one-dimensional measure. This conjecture is supported by a principal component analysis of the control behavior dummy variables (not reported). It shows that a one-dimensional composite variable would retain more than 80% of the variation in the 10 dichotomous measures. Therefore, we use a count variable of the number of separate behaviors indicated by each respondent.</p>

<title>Predicting Postseparation Violence by Control Behaviors</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077801213490560">Figure 1</xref> provides a preview of the main result of the analysis. It shows the likelihood of exposure to one of our three stalking behaviors, or to postseparation assault, ordered by the number of different control behaviors used by the partner before separation. First, looking at the pattern of the three stalking outcomes, we notice that they are highly similar and appear to be linearly related to our measure of coercion. In the following analysis, therefore, we present results using the joint stalking measure as the outcome variable.</p>

<p>In the case of the assault measure, it is not clear from the figure whether a linear or nonlinear variable would best capture the dynamics. For this reason, we estimate and compare both these specifications in the empirical analysis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801213490560">Table 3</xref> gives the results from a linear probability model. The dependent variable is set to 1 if the female respondent was subjected to at least one act of either stalking (column 1), or postseparation assault (columns 2 and 3). Row 1 contains the parameter estimates for our measure of control. Its coefficient takes the expected positive sign and is highly significant. In the first column, the coefficient’s size indicates that one additional control behavior corresponds to an increase in the probability of stalking of 8.6%. This means that a woman who reported all 10 control behaviors was eight times more likely to be stalked than a woman who reported only one behavior. Dividing the stalking variable into its three subcomponents of threats, unwanted visits, or being followed or waylaid only marginally affects the size of the coefficients.</p>

<p>The results for postseparation assault are contained in columns 2 and 3. Recalling the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077801213490560">Figure 1</xref>, it is not obvious that a linear relationship best captures the correlation between assault and the number of control behaviors. Measuring control in this linear fashion (column 2) gives a coefficient of 0.035 and an adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of .078. This means that, on average, being subject to one additional control behavior is associated with a 3.5% greater victimization rate for postseparation assault. In column 3, we instead apply a linear trend with a threshold by letting the coercion variable take the value of 0 up to a threshold of five control behaviors, and then increase linearly. The size of the parameter shows that for women who are subjected to more than five control behaviors, each additional behavior increases the likelihood of being assaulted by 8.9%, a number very close to that of the linear specification of stalking in column 1. This specification of coercion does not change the explained variance, however.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077801213490560">6</xref></sup> Thus the data do not allow us to determine whether the occurrence of postseparation assault is limited to highly controlling men, while less controlling men could be more unlikely to batter their ex-partners, or if the link from control to postseparation abuse is linear for both stalking and assault.</p>
<p>Examining the confounding variables also yields some interesting findings. They support the emphasis placed by previous research on children as a risk marker for stalking, but not for assault. First, the presence of at least one common child corresponds to a 10.2% greater likelihood of stalking (column 1), and a 5.8% greater likelihood of assault. Thus the effect of children is of comparable magnitude to the use of one more controlling behavior. The results also show that substance abuse of the man is positively correlated with stalking.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077801213490560">Table 4</xref>, we evaluate the robustness of our parameter estimate pertaining to the control variable in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801213490560">Table 3</xref> by varying the specification in several ways. First, testing for functional form, we see that the results from a linear probability model (Panel A) are highly similar in size to the marginal effects estimated in a Probit model (Panel B).</p>

<p>For a comparison with the linear probability model coefficients, marginal effects from the Probit model are presented on the third line of each cell in Panel B.</p>
<p>Next, we examine the results for changing the specification of the control variable. In columns 1 and 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077801213490560">Table 4</xref>, we restate the results using the count variable from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801213490560">Table 3</xref>. On the right-hand side of columns 3 and 4, we instead use a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if the number of control behaviors exceeds three (determined by the cluster analysis procedure [results not reported] recommended in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801213490560">Johnson &amp; Leone, 2005</xref>). A comparison of the results between the left-hand and the right-hand half of the table yields no changes in our main conclusion. The positive and highly significant coefficients for the dichotomous dependent variable indicate continued support for a strong correlation between control behaviors during a relationship and postseparation stalking or assault. However, the explained variance is much lower when using the dichotomous control measure (not reported), a result which supports the conjecture of a linear shape of the relationship between coercion and stalking, as previously indicated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077801213490560">Figure 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077801213490560">7</xref></sup> To further test the appropriateness of the count variable, we test the hypothesis of equality of each scale step by comparing the sizes of the estimated parameters after disaggregating the continuous measures. This hypothesis is not rejected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077801213490560">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Within each column 1 to 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077801213490560">Table 4</xref>, we evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated coercion parameter to the inclusion of controls. For both panels, each set of rows reports results using (a) no control variables, (b) only the joint-child indicator, or (c) all controls included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801213490560">Table 3</xref>. Irrespective of functional form or operationalization of the main predictor, we find that the marginal effects of control on stalking and postseparation assault are highly robust to the inclusion of additional confounders. This suggests that the effect of control on postseparation stalking and assault is not mainly driven by background characteristics. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1077801213490560">Table 5</xref>, we show further support for this conclusion. It presents the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values corresponding to each of the estimations of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1077801213490560">Table 5</xref>. These values only increase by very small magnitudes when the confounders are added.</p>

<p>Our analysis could suffer from excluded confounders. In particular, personal traits of the man may drive both the likelihood of control and the likelihood of stalking or postseparation assault. Noting that our analysis focuses on prediction rather than causality, our general claim that control is a main predictor of stalking and violence is not refuted unless there exist unobserved, but observable, factors that would make information on control behaviors redundant. From previous studies, we know that substance abuse can function as a proxy for the existence of a psychiatric disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801213490560">Kessler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801213490560">Regier et al., 1990</xref>). Controlling for the man’s substance abuse, which enters significantly in the estimation, does not affect the estimate of control behaviors on stalking or assault. This suggests that it is unlikely that an underlying omitted psychiatric disorder accounts for the full scope of our observed link between control and stalking/assault.</p>
<p>Concerning the woman’s personal traits and background characteristics, we have a richer set of proxies available. In addition to her socioeconomic characteristics and substance abuse, we also included a measure of her experiences of abuse during childhood. None of these variables was statistically significant in any specification, and none affected the estimate of coercion on stalking or postseparation assault.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077801213490560">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>The empirical results reported in this article show that men who subject their partners to control behaviors during a relationship are substantially more likely to commit acts of stalking and violence after separation. In the case of stalking, we find that the likelihood increases linearly with the number of control behaviors exhibited during the relationship. Low levels of control are found to be unrelated to postseparation assault, but for more controlling men the risk increases with each additional behavior.</p>
<p>Finding an important role for control in predicting violent behavior is in accordance with the understanding derived from feminist theory and evolutionary psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801213490560">Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801213490560">Walker, 1984</xref>). The results also support the usefulness of variables describing control to explain heterogeneity in the severity and frequency of adverse outcomes in violent relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801213490560">Johnson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801213490560">Johnson &amp; Leone, 2005</xref>). In this article, we extended these previous insights from the case of ongoing relationships to postseparation stalking and violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077801213490560">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>An influential strand of research on violence in intimate relationships has focused on stress as a key driver of violent acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801213490560">Card &amp; Dahl, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801213490560">Gelles, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801213490560">Straus et al., 1990</xref>). Reflecting on our results from this perspective, one possible interpretation is that controlling and violent men are more likely to respond to the stress of divorce by acts of stalking and violence. As such, the results point out a potentially important aspect of heterogeneity in the link from stress to violent acts, a link that could be explored in future research. Nevertheless, it is questionable whether the “stress hypothesis” has the potential of informing a rewarding strategy of violence prevention. Postponing the stressful dissolution of a violent relationship would hardly contribute to the well-being of a woman subjected to abuse.</p>
<p>More fruitful avenues for further research could perhaps include a formal modeling of the mechanisms that link control behaviors to violence after separation. Empirical tests of more elaborate predictions, however, would necessitate an expansion of the standard survey format. This should include more detailed questions regarding women’s relationship history, in particular relating to experiences of control and violence victimization. The surveys should more fully explore women’s motivations and reasoning behind exiting and reentering controlling and violent relationships. The questions should aim at mapping out patterns in the occurrence of control behaviors and violence during the different phases of this—emotional and physical—separation process. If possible, elaborate surveys should also be directed at both sexes to gain an understanding of men’s mindsets and motivations.</p>
<p>We find that control behaviors are quantitatively more important predictors than a number of other well-established risk markers such as income, alcohol abuse, joint children, and violent experiences in childhood. This result could guide preventive work. For instance, control behaviors are not emphasized in the widely used Spousal Assault Risk Assessment tool (SARA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490560">Kropp, Hart, Webster, &amp; Eaves, 1999</xref>). Rather, they enter via a single question that includes a combined assessment of earlier sexual violence and/or sexual jealousy. Our results highlight the potential for raising the efficiency of risk assessment by taking into account more (and different) control behaviors to more fully assess the extent and magnitude of the context of control. This strategy should also hold advantages compared to the use of questions regarding the abuser’s mental status or violent experiences as a child. Arguably, female victims are more likely to accurately assess behaviors to which they have been subjected, than judging their partners’ psychological health and childhood experiences.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we want to highlight our results from the viewpoint of society’s way of dealing with postseparation violence. If such violence stems from patriarchal norms of control, the justice system alone treats only the symptoms and not the roots of this problem. Education and awareness of the link between control and violence, as well as of the consequences for women’s health and well-being, are critical. Since postseparation stalking and assault are common, there could be great social gains from reducing the prevalence and reproduction of patriarchal norms that foster such acts against female partners.</p>

<p>These studies on the “risk markers” for postseparation assault and stalking have been conducted using convenience samples, with a few exceptions. Some have emphasized the importance of alcohol and drug abuse for stalking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801213490560">Logan, Leukefeld, &amp; Walker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801213490560">Roberts, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801213490560">2005</xref>) and for stalking violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801213490560">Brewster, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801213490560">Mullen, Pathé, &amp; Purcell, 2000</xref>), while other studies have found no significant impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801213490560">Fleury et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801213490560">DeKeseredy and Schwartz (2009)</xref> report an association between postseparation assault and a strong perception among the perpetrators that men should be in charge in the household. Other studies have pointed to the importance of the presence of joint children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490560">Block &amp; DeKeseredy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801213490560">Fleury et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801213490560">Kaye, Stubbs, and Tolmie, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801213490560">2003b</xref>), and the woman’s age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801213490560">Johnson, 1996</xref>). Psychotic disorders have been found to decrease the likelihood of postseparation violence, while personality disorders have not been significantly related to this outcome (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801213490560">Rosenfeld, 2004</xref>). Yet, other studies have documented an impact of household economic variables on domestic violence in ongoing relationships, in particular with respect to employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801213490560">Macmillian &amp; Gartner, 1999</xref>), income level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801213490560">Bowlus &amp; Seitz, 2006</xref>), and the family gender wage gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801213490560">Aizer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801213490560">Farmer &amp; Teifenhaler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801213490560">Tauchen et al., 1991</xref>).</p>

<p>This does not mean that the result contradicts the conjecture that violence may be triggered by the stressful event of separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801213490560">Card &amp; Dahl, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801213490560">Straus et al., 1990</xref>). However, separation implies limited contact between the partners. Therefore, an explanation for postseparation violence that emphasizes that stress-induced losses of control trigger violent reactions against the people in the perpetrator’s vicinity cannot account for the behavior of seeking out an estranged partner and specifically hurting her.</p>

<p>Evidence from survey reports of violent relationships supports this division. Women who report having been subjected to control behaviors also report having experience of more severe violent acts and a higher frequency of violent acts than women who report a history of violence but not of control behaviors.</p>

<p>Naturally, for women who responded affirmatively to being subjected to violence by an ex-partner, but negatively to being subjected to postseparation violence by that person, the violence clearly happened during the ongoing relationship. For the victims of postseparation violence, we are able to use other survey questions to establish the validity of this assumption for more than two thirds of the cases. We use the following questions to determine exposure to violence during a relationship: (a) whether violent acts were reported to have taken place more than one year ago, and the most recent violent relationship ended less than one year ago; (b) whether violence started before marriage; (c) whether violence took place during or before pregnancy; (d) whether the respondent left the ex-partner because of violence.</p>

<p>We also check the robustness of the results by adding the square of the linear coercion measure to the linear specification (not reported), a specification similar to the nonlinear count variable in column 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801213490560">Table 3</xref>. The adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value is unaffected and, once more, we conclude that the available data do not give any more specific information about the mechanism from control behaviors to postseparation assault.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-1077801213490560">
<label>7.</label>
<p>A simple robustness check (not reported) is carried out by letting a dummy variable take the value of 1 if the number of controlling behaviors exceeds five, a cutoff indicated as a suitable threshold for the assault outcome by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077801213490560">Figure 1</xref>. The parameter estimate of coercion does not change for stalking but increases somewhat for assault. For all three outcome variables, the ratio of explained to total variance decreases as compared to when using a count measure of coercion.</p>

<p>For our count variable to be a good representation of the 10 separate control behaviors, we need it to be a linear ordinalization, where each increment corresponds to an equal increase in the outcome. Formally, we test the restriction β<sub>1</sub> = (1/2) β<sub>1</sub> = (1/3) β<sub>3</sub> =…= (1/10) β<sub>10</sub>, where β<sub>i</sub> corresponds to the dummy variable for the i:th scale step of the count variable of control behaviors.</p>

<p>Some variables concerning the woman’s characteristics are possibly affected by the postseparation outcome. While these confounders are not exogenous, the endogeneity caused by their being measured <italic>after</italic> stalking/assault has taken place is likely to work against our hypothesis. This is because the potential confounding both on and of these variables is likely to go in one direction over time. Compare the discussion in <italic>Mostly Harmless Econometrics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801213490560">Angrist &amp; Pischke, 2009</xref>, p. 66.

<p>Arguably, this outcome yielded a more robust test because of the natural time-ordering of the independent and dependent variables. Previous studies suffered from reverse causality as violent acts in an ongoing relationship can trigger increases in control. But stalking or assault <italic>after separation</italic> will not cause control behaviors that took place before the relationship was discontinued.</p>
