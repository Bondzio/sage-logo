<abstract>
<p>In the past, humanists and scientists have held very different views about the role of collaboration in scholarly research. From the point of view of a Principal Investigator in a scientific laboratory, this article examines the increasingly dominant role of collaboration in scientific research. In contrast to the ‘consensus research’ model of the sciences, humanists have often viewed the role of collaboration in research with considerable skepticism and have placed greater value on the traditional model of the solitary scholar pursuing knowledge and truth. An examination of some of the distinctive cultural differences between the humanities and sciences suggests that the benefits of collaboration may come to play an increasingly significant role in the future of humanistic research.</p>

<p>A<sc>sking a scientist to reflect </sc>on the nature of collaboration is much like asking a fish to reflect on the nature of water. Fish are probably not aware of water. They are surrounded by it. It is where they live and act. Among scientists, collaboration is a way of life, and we seldom reflect on collaboration as an activity within our everyday professional lives. It is like breathing. Yet it seems that collaboration is quite unusual and may even be viewed with considerable skepticism in the humanities. The vision of the solitary scholar enriched through years of quiet reflection seems their ideal. Such a vision certainly seems appealing to a scientist like me, who manages a laboratory with postdoctoral fellows, technicians, graduate students, undergraduate students, their payrolls and a constant stream of grant deadlines. Why have these two essential approaches to knowledge developed such contrasting images of collaboration’s role in the generation of truth and understanding? What are the limits of each approach, and what are their complementary strengths?</p>
<p>Since this article is primarily intended for a humanities audience, it may be worthwhile to explain a little about the process of writing a paper for publication in the sciences and then contrast that with publication in the humanities. Undoubtedly, there is variation among scientists and humanists in their individual styles and mode of research and writing. My reflections represent stereotypes of difference. Yet, in articulating these differences, we can begin to form a perception of how collaboration manifests itself differently across these domains of inquiry.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1474022212437310"><title>A day in the life of a PI</title>
<p>The Principal Investigator (PI) on a grant or research project usually has a laboratory group locally and a network of collaborators globally. The typical laboratory consists of three or four postdoctoral fellows, three or four graduate students, a couple of undergraduates, and one or two technicians. While this makes for a stimulating and often intellectually cohesive group for inquiry, it also places an enormous burden on the PI to acquire funds to pay salaries, buy equipment and supplies, computers, etc., none of which usually is supplied by the home academic institution. We are expected to build an empire and pay for it.</p>
<p>In addition to the laboratory established at the home academic institution, the PI is also responsible for coordinating research that can involve multiple investigators at other institutions. Sometimes these collaborations are supported, and in fact legalized, by subcontracts between the home academic institution of the PI and the collaborating investigator’s institution. Hence most of a PI’s time is spent writing grants to coordinate his or her laboratory and to foster and support collaborations with other institutions.</p>
<p>The PI’s main role in the scientific investigation is to establish the broad intellectual goals of the research undertaken in the laboratory. The <italic>execution</italic> of the research is often accomplished through the efforts of many hands at many laboratory benches across many institutions. The PI <italic>coordinates</italic> the various activities of individuals toward the resolution of research questions that form the core of the laboratory’s research program. How is this coordination usually achieved?</p>
<p>In the center of my lab is a large conference table surrounded by eight chairs and facing an enormous blackboard. Starting at mid-morning, my students, postdocs and I gather around this table to present our findings of the last few days. Jack may present the results of a particular experiment that we had designed a few weeks ago, or Jill may present the results of a computer simulation, or George may relate the current status of samples being shipped from Uganda to the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) or samples from New York to Canada. At these meetings we identify three essential needs: first, the need for further data or experiments that must be carried out in order to evaluate a particular theory or hypothesis and the identification of <italic>who in the lab will be responsible</italic> to execute or gather the data or carry out the experiment; second, we identify the need for particular expertise or data that we do not have locally in the lab and that will require contacting an outside collaborator, and we identify <italic>who in the lab will be responsible</italic> for contacting these potential collaborators; and third, once a sufficient set of data is generated and analyzed and the results constitute a sufficiently interesting story, there is the need to write a paper for publication, identifying potential journals for an outlet, and identifying <italic>who in the lab will be responsible</italic> for writing the first draft and submitting the paper for publication.</p>
<p>Almost all of our research is structured around specific problems that result in individual papers. A student’s PhD thesis often consists of a collection of three or more separate publishable manuscripts where the student is the first author of a multi-authored work. The pattern of authorship reveals a nearly universal structure within the scientific community. The first author is the person most responsible for the execution of experiments, analysis of data, and the writing of the paper. The <italic>last</italic> author is usually the PI, recognized as the senior investigator in the group. The relative intellectual contributions to the particular paper march in from these bookends with the senior people advancing from the rear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474022212437310">1</xref></sup> Many scientific journals now include as a footnote a specific breakdown of the exact contributions of each author toward the publication of the paper. For example, the Public Library of Science (PLoS) family of journals – very highly regarded and cited – requires all published multi-authored papers to include a breakdown of author contributions by designating who made specific contributions to (1) conceiving and designing the experiments, (2) performing the experiments, (3) analyzing the data, (4) writing the manuscript, and (5) other forms of contribution, such as software design, sample acquisition, etc. In an enterprise becoming increasingly dominated by collaboration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474022212437310">Figure 1</xref>), it becomes particularly important to construct vehicles to identify the exact contribution of each collaborator within the group’s collective production.

<p>Here is where we begin to see a major difference between humanistic inquiry and scientific investigation. Let me relate a story. My wife received her graduate degree in English, and she is a poet. During her training, she took a graduate class in Shakespeare with a well-known Shakespeare scholar. My wife chose to write her final class paper on some aspects of <italic>Richard II</italic>, and her teacher found the paper extremely interesting and nearly ready for publication. At the end of my wife’s paper, this teacher attached two pages of bibliography (mostly books!) that my wife should read to strengthen her arguments. My wife had no interest in spending 6–8 months reading scholarly works on Shakespeare – as laudable as that might be – since she wanted to work on her own poetry. It was obvious that this teacher already knew all of the material contained in her suggested bibliography since it was heavily annotated with notes on the exact relationship between the cited work and points my wife was making in her paper. The paper was never written.</p>
<p>To a scientist, the solution to this dilemma – after all, it would have been nice to have this paper produced – is rather obvious. Teacher and student would simply collaborate in the writing of the paper. The professor brings years of specialized experience and context, the student contributes a particular new point of view perhaps expressible as a hypothesis about a piece of writing. Together they generate a work of scholarship that neither alone would have been able to produce. Why have there been so many obstacles associated with collaboration in the humanities?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474022212437310">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474022212437310"><title>Claims and evidence</title>
<p>There are deep cultural differences between the humanities and the sciences. C. P. Snow’s celebrated essay on <italic>The Two Cultures</italic> only skims the surface of a vast oceanic divide. It would be presumptuous of me to believe that I completely understand the cultural basis for the different approaches to collaboration within these different discourse communities. Collaboration is one aspect of the culture of each domain, and an authentic analysis of this cultural phenotype would require the effort of a good sociologist or anthropologist. I am neither. Nonetheless, being a proper professor, I certainly feel free to speculate on a few intriguing possibilities.</p>
<p>In preparing for this article, and during the several conversations I have had with my colleagues in the humanities during this Colgate/Emory dialogue, it has become apparent to me that, in the humanities, often a well-articulated claim is taken as prima facie evidence <italic>for</italic> that claim. In the sciences we make the distinction between the claim and the evidence for the claim very clear – hypothesis versus test. Sometimes we even list sets of hypotheses and designate alternative hypotheses with numbers, such as H0, H1, H2, etc. We then design our experiments or gather the data to adjudicate among these alternative competing hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022212437310">Platt, 1964</xref>). Then comes the evidence for each. Does the evidence lead to the rejection of H0 in favor of H2, H1 vs. H3, etc.? Often, but not always, hypothesis testing relies on quantitative differences among the predictions associated with particular hypotheses, and these quantitative differences can be assessed statistically. In the humanities, it seems to me, the well-formed claim is often taken as self-evident because it is well formed.</p>
<p>Take the following example related very much to the Colgate/Emory initiative. Many of the articles that accompany this one assert the importance and value of education in the humanities. One sees and hears assertions such as the claim that liberal education makes people more free, or better able to make judgments, or happier, or capable of making more developed moral choices. What is the evidence for such claims? It is far from self-evident. In his provocative book <italic>In Bluebeard’s Castle</italic>, the distinguished literary critic and theorist, George <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474022212437310">Steiner (1974)</xref>, challenges the very foundations of the assumption that the humanities are humanizing. After the experience of the concentration camp, how can we claim the humanizing value of the humanities when very well-educated and culturally sophisticated men could commit unspeakable atrocities in the morning and then go home to read Hölderlin or listen to Mozart? How do we start to formulate an approach to evaluating the claim that there is value in the humanities? What evidence do we need to gather? What data are needed to test the assertion?</p>
<p>It is tempting to dismiss the desire to validate humanistic claims using data or carefully constructed alternative hypotheses that require strong inference as merely acquiescence to the hegemony of the sciences – and the humanities certainly have much to fear from this hegemony. Nonetheless, borrowing some of the tools that have been developed in the sciences to adjudicate and verify assertions in the humanities is simply another form of collaboration that seems natural if we are to believe in the universality of truth and epistemology.</p>
<p>Former book review editor of <italic>The Sunday Times</italic> and Oxford professor John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022212437310">Carey (2010)</xref> implies just such collaboration in his provocatively entitled book, <italic>What Good are the Arts?</italic> Carey revisits Steiner’s conundrum, but rather than assert the obviousness of the claim, he charges us to find the evidence. Carey himself begins the investigation, and it looks very promising for the humanities! Carey summarizes the general evidence for a linkage between reductions in violent behavior and rates of recidivism in prisons where there are active humanities teaching programs, including theater, writing, poetry, and the visual arts. He concludes that there is compelling evidence that such programs improve inmates’ well-being and behavior. For instance, prisoners at Her Majesty’s Prison Bullingdon experienced a 58% decline in violent behaviors for six months before and six months after the inmates’ production of a musical version of <italic>Julius Caesar</italic>. Much of the evidence is rather anecdotal but can be interpreted within existing theories of how the humanities might affect behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474022212437310">3</xref></sup> One can also raise objections to claims for the efficacy of humanities teaching in the prisons since these observations are not controlled and open to a variety of other interpretations. For example, we don’t know if the reduction in violence is due to just having an educated person pay attention to a neglected human being. Would a class in basic biology have the same effect? I rather doubt it, but we need the evidence if we are to believe the claim.</p>
<p>The acquisition of evidence, relying on new data, often requires assistance and assistants, like a good defense lawyer who uses a staff of detectives, legal researchers and forensic experts. A single person may write the final brief, but it depends on many others. In the sciences we simply make visible the hidden contributions of all those assistants. I believe that the hidden contributions that accompany humanities research – especially as the humanities work toward a more evidentiary model – will likewise gravitate to a more collaborative and revealing structure.</p>
<p>Marshalling evidence in support of a position or a thesis, of course, is commonplace in humanistic writing. The example of my wife’s interaction with her professor was largely about the issue of evidence. The professor was suggesting areas of reading that my wife could call upon to garner evidence for her position. What seems unnatural to a scientist is the desire to recreate expertise rather than utilize expertise in a collaborative enterprise that improves the quality of the final product and saves time. Consider the following analogy: a defense lawyer needs some forensic blood work done on a defendant. A forensics expert would do the blood work, and the results would be communicated to the lawyer. They have collaborated in acquiring the evidence. The lawyer and the defendant arrange for the sample to be delivered and the forensic scientist performs the test and provides the results. Who would expect the forensic scientist to hand a laboratory manual over to the lawyer and suggest ‘The methods you seek for doing the blood work can be found here. If you have problems, I can be contacted.’ This seems rather a silly way of going about the task. Yet, so often we are asking our young colleagues to rediscover what we already know and to newly acquire what we have already mastered.</p>
<p>One of the great benefits of mutual collaboration, certainly as I have experienced in doing collaborative science research, is simply the fact that we can get more done, embrace a wider range of subjects, and have more fun if we work together rather than require solitary inquiry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474022212437310"><title>Insight and Instantiation</title>
<p>In the sciences, we assign significance to a research program based on a particular discovery. We can often specifically ask <italic>and answer</italic> the question: ‘What was X’s great insight?’ James Watson and Francis Crick visualized a model for the mechanics of DNA replication. Einstein recognized that the laws of physics might appear differently if we were riding on the tail of a comet. Sometimes these insights can come as a blinding glimpse of the obvious. The discovery of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), ultimately leading to a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for Karry Mullis in 1993, is a remarkable case in point.</p>
<p>Structurally, DNA exists as a double helix of two strands of macromolecules wound tightly around each other. Heating DNA in solution can separate these two bound strands, and separating the strands would allow access to the single-string of information contained in the DNA molecule. If we could replicate these separated strands, then we could build up enough DNA to chemically decipher the code contained in our hereditary material. Unfortunately, at the temperatures required for DNA separation, the enzymes responsible for DNA replication are also neutralized. How can we get the information from these single strands when the machinery necessary to replicate the molecules to sufficient levels for chemical characterization is itself simultaneously rendered non-functional? It was a very big problem.</p>
<p>Mullis was an avid California surfer, and, as he relates the story, while driving back from a surfing excursion, he suddenly recalled that there are certain bacteria that regularly live in thermal hot springs at extremely high temperatures. These bacteria, <italic>Bacillus thermosaquaticus</italic>, literally meaning ‘Bacteria hot water’, have somehow evolved to live at very high temperatures without having their DNA-replicating enzymes denature and become non-functional. Mullis’ insight was to recognize that, by using this bacteria’s enzymes, we could unfold any DNA at high temperature but still replicate the single strands since the bacteria’s enzymes would not have been affected. He went back to his lab and began developing the technique of heating and cooling DNA, using the enzymes from <italic>B. thermosaquaticus</italic> that would lead to successive rounds of unfolding and replicating the hereditary material that encodes all of life. Not a bad insight, and he was justly rewarded.</p>
<p>What can we say are the insights of the great figures in the humanities? What was Shakespeare’s particular insight – that husbands can become jealous of their wives or that some men can be overtaken by ambition? These are not novel insights, but common experiences of our all too human existence.</p>
<p>What is unique to Shakespeare is how he instantiates these insights. It is the particular work, this <italic>particular</italic> poetry, rhythm and artistry that we celebrate. This unique instantiation differs greatly from the sciences and here is where, perhaps, the humanities have their greatest value and power. While the sciences give weight to the insight itself, little attention is paid to the manner by which that insight is expressed. Our literature is artificially constrained in structure and very boring to read. We teach all of our students the codified structure for a scientific publication – Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion. We keep our writing to the absolute minimum since we are paying page charges for publication; reviews almost always come back with suggestions on cutting the length of an article. The rich meaning of a significant result is often left for the reader to surmise and for the community of scientists to affirm.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, I once went to a lecture by Roger Shinn, then President of the Union Theological Seminary in New York City, on the topic of Peace and Nuclear Disarmament. At that lecture Shinn quipped: ‘In the sciences, they feel like they have done something well when they <italic>do</italic> something well. In the humanities, we feel like we have done something well, when we <italic>say</italic> something well.’ There is quite a bit of truth in this little remark. Yet saying something well is, in fact, doing something well. Expression can reveal more than we can uncover by merely doing. Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474022212437310">Polanyi (1969)</xref> in his philosophical works on science and knowledge differentiated between Knowing and Being and recognized that crafted expression reveals aspects of Being that scientific ‘Doing’ simply cannot reveal. The expressive instantiation of the great humanists generates a different pathway to knowing that is often deeper and more directly meaningful in our everyday individual lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1474022212437310"><title>The net value of collaboration</title>
<p>A very wise acquaintance of mine once remarked that whatever is your greatest strength will simultaneously be your greatest weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022212437310">Glassman, 1997</xref>). I have found this simple observation to be true for almost every aspect of our lives. The sciences have developed the collaborative model to an extent that it is nearly impossible to imagine a research program executed by a single individual. This degree of collaboration comes with costs that every scientist recognizes. The monetary demand of a large collaborative enterprise exerts a tremendous stress on young scientists, which can break or make a career. The typical size of a research grant from the National Institutes of Health is around $1.5–2.0 million<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474022212437310">4</xref></sup> and a beginning Assistant Professor is expected to receive <italic>two</italic> (!) grants of this size before coming up for tenure – in addition to the expected demands for publication, student training, and teaching. It is no wonder that young scientists have little time to engage in the totality of university life since they are so worried and stressed about just getting these grants. Once they have them, they are often locked into successive renewals to meet the salary requirements of those they have taken into their laboratories and for whom they provide a livelihood.</p>
<p>At a major research university, such as Emory, it is expected that researchers train graduate students and cover the costs of salary, health insurance, and research supplies from their grants. Since training support is tied to individual grants, the intellectual scope of the student’s work can be (and most often is) constrained to the research project covered by the grant. Students in the sciences are extremely limited in developing their own direction of inquiry. Most of us recognize that this is a huge structural problem in the sciences. We would like to support a creative and independent upcoming class of science researchers, but independence is usually achieved only after the young investigator establishes his or her own laboratory following years of graduate student and postdoctoral training.</p>
<p>The model of the solitary scholar that dominates the humanities may seem rather isolating and lonely. Many of the humanities professors I have talked to in preparation for this short article have commented on the loneliness they often experience and the envy they feel when looking at the scientist’s bustling laboratory. At the same time, solitary research lends itself to significant intellectual breakthroughs that consensus research may not allow. Most great synthetic ideas, even in the sciences, have come from single individuals not groups.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago I was asked by the Ecological Society of America (ESA) to compile an edited volume of the classic papers in the field of ecology in celebration of the ESA’s 75th anniversary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022212437310">Real and Brown, 1991</xref>). Jim Brown and I established an editorial board of leading scholars in the field and in compiling the list of candidate papers we were struck with how many seminal works were presidential addresses, synthetic papers delivered by eminent scholars to an audience of their peers, given not as a final review of their life’s work, but a true synthesis that generated great new insight and leading to new approaches and areas of inquiry. From the 1930s through the 1960s there existed a class of scholarly essay in the sciences that was neither technical monograph nor short journal communication. Scientists at that time often produced single-authored short-book essays (approximately 125–150 printed pages in length). These short-book essays were similar in structure to the presidential address and they often established new synthetic visions that pioneered new domains of research; Theodosius <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022212437310">Dobzhansky’s <italic>Genetics and the Origin of Species</italic> (1941)</xref>, David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022212437310">Lack’s <italic>Darwin’s Finches</italic> (1947)</xref>, Sir Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212437310">Elton’s <italic>The Ecology of Invasions</italic> (1958)</xref>, and George <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022212437310">Williams’ <italic>Adaptation and Natural Selection</italic> (1966)</xref> are brilliant examples of this genre. I believe that there is an emerging niche for just this sort of essay in the modern scientific literature,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474022212437310">5</xref></sup> and essays of this sort would bridge solitary scholarship with the collaborative research that informs it. Perhaps we can think of the (re)emergence of styles of writing and scholarly presentation that embrace both the humanities and the sciences as the very best form of collaboration, since collaboration at this high level will help bridge the two great cultures of the intellect.</p>

Typical grants are awarded in modules of $25,000, and in applying for a grant one specifies the number of modules not the exact dollar amount required to execute the research. The basic monetary unit at NIH is one module! The requirement for funding as a prerequisite for tenure has produced certain pathologies in the tenure process. The most important requirement for a successful tenure package in the sciences is the existence of an <italic>active</italic> grant during the review process. Meeting this condition can get tricky. The average duration of a grant is four or five years. If a young Assistant Professor is lucky enough to receive a grant during the first year after joining the university, then the grant will terminate in time for them to submit a renewal, have that renewal reviewed and even leave enough time to revise and resubmit. If, however, it takes two or three years for them to get their first grant, then they may come up for tenure just at the time when their grant is up for renewal, but they have insufficient time for revision and resubmission. Strategically, since active funding is the most important criterion, it may be better to postpone acquiring a grant to assure that funding is active rather than to undertake review in the uncertain period where the first renewal is underway. I do not believe anyone at the university would think that purposeful delay in research is a healthy attribute of a system of inquiry.</p></fn>
