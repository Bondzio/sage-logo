<abstract>
<p>Variationist sociolinguistics has provided essential information about community-wide patterns of language variation and change. However, as the field has developed, the need to provide coherent explanations for observed correlations has highlighted problems with the conceptualization of style, social meaning and the linguistic variable. Using data from two case studies, this article illustrates how a more nuanced account of stylistic practice provides a richer understanding of the social and cognitive basis of language use. In particular, it is argued that the linguistic analysis of social groups should be driven by the specific social concerns of the groups studied, not by the search for variable ways to ‘say the same thing’. This approach not only enables a fuller account of the social meaning of language features, it demonstrates that social meanings may be encoded at the intersection of components of the grammar (phonology, morphosyntax and discourse), and in more complex ways than has previously been assumed.</p>

<title>1 Introduction: Style and the variationist paradigm</title>
<p>The last decade has witnessed a quiet revolution in variationist sociolinguistics. Style has been given a social life. No longer the dowdy cousin of dialect, style is emerging as interesting in its own right. Recent work has argued that style is the loci of social meaning, ‘the best level for approaching the meaning of variation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963947011432051">Eckert, 2008</xref>: 456). It is the process through which sociolinguistic meanings emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947011432051">Coupland, 2007a</xref>: 2) and, as such, it is now considered ‘a pivotal construct in the study of sociolinguistic variation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0963947011432051">Rickford and Eckert, 2001</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>Style has always featured in the variationists’ repertoire but, until recently, its use has been rather circumscribed. Stylistic variation has been measured for descriptive purposes – as ‘an important independent variable but never … the focal point’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947011432051">Chambers, 2003</xref>: 6, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947011432051">Coupland, 2007a</xref>: 9). Despite a number of critiques which have sought to develop this limited interpretation of style (for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947011432051">Bell, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947011432051">Coupland, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0963947011432051">Rickford and McNair-Knox, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963947011432051">Schilling-Estes, 2002</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963947011432051">Labov’s (1966)</xref> unidimensional ‘style as attention-to-speech’ model has dominated the field. Researchers have been interested in style for what it can reveal about the frequencies of linguistic variants speakers produce in a limited number of engineered contexts, relative to others who speak the same dialect. Questions about why speakers style-shift, the validity of the styles measured or the interpersonal functions style-shifting fulfils have generally not concerned many variationists.</p>
<p>The paucity of more nuanced analyses of style can be explained by the aims of much variationist work. Variationist studies provide essential information about community-wide patterns of language use which, in turn, tell us about the structure of communities and the directions of language change. Without these studies, we would not have information about the status of change in progress, nor would we have an essential overview of diachronic language use and its social correlates. The use of standardized quantitative techniques can provide key insights into universal patterns of change. To give a recent example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0963947011432051">Tagliamonte and D’Arcy’s (2009)</xref> apparent time analysis of morphosyntactic and discourse-pragmatic features provides confirmation of the adolescent peak in the incrementation model of language change observed for phonological variables by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963947011432051">Labov (2001)</xref>. Such insight would be impossible without aggregated and abstracted datasets.</p>
<p>However, observing the social trajectory of a language change is not the same as explaining it, as both Labov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963947011432051">2001</xref>: 325) and Tagliamonte and D’Arcy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0963947011432051">2009</xref>: 98) have acknowledged. Where models use abstraction to process data, they filter out much of the social detail that vivifies language use. As a result, the study of social meaning has become distinct from the study of sociolinguistic variation. Whereas the former has largely been relegated to studies of linguistic anthropology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0963947011432051">Woolard, 2008</xref>), the latter has been perceived as ‘sociolinguistics proper’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0963947011432051">Trudgill, 1978</xref>: 12). This false dichotomy has meant that traditional variationist work has rarely been able (or even inclined) to provide comprehensive accounts of the social correlates of language use. In much of this work, social meaning is primarily tied to social groups, and any attachment to other layers of social meaning is secondary or absent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963947011432051">2</xref></sup> This prioritizing of dialect over ‘independent variables’ such as style means that variants are typically presented as being ‘working class’ or ‘female’ first, and ‘casual’ or ‘formal’ second. This can be illustrated using <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947011432051">Figure 1</xref>, which shows differentiation according to use of (ing) from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963947011432051">Labov’s (2001)</xref> Philadelphia neighbourhood study. This figure shows a regular pattern for (ing) which has been repeated across sociolinguistic surveys (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963947011432051">Campbell-Kibler, 2006</xref>: 22–41 for a comprehensive overview): working-class speakers use more -<italic>in</italic> across stylistic contexts than middle-class speakers. Consequently, one might identify <italic>-in</italic> as a ‘working-class’ variant, and <italic>-ing</italic> as a ‘middle-class’ variant. However, if this is so, in the more casual style, the speech of the middle classes looks more like the working classes, given that the middle classes use <italic>-in</italic> at a frequency found in the working-class range. If, in a particular context, the speech of one social group looks more like the speech of another social group, how accurate is it to define the meaning of a variant in relation to just one social dialect? In terms of social meaning, we are left to question whether the middle-class speaker’s use of <italic>-in</italic> means working class, or casual, or perhaps a bit of both.</p>

<p>If one’s goal is simply to document the trajectory of linguistic features, it may not be important to identify all the social correlates of language use and the social meanings they index. However, where variationist data contributes to our understanding of human social and cognitive language abilities it is less easy to dismiss concerns about social meaning. Much of the recent work on exemplar theory – a theory of language acquisition which proposes that speakers store socially-loaded exemplars as opposed to abstract underlying linguistic rules – has drawn upon sociolinguistic data (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963947011432051">Drager, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963947011432051">Foulkes and Docherty, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963947011432051">Hay and Drager, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963947011432051">Hay et al., 2006</xref>). If variationist data is being used to advance linguist knowledge in this way, then variationists must be able to provide a coherent account of the social dimensions they study.</p>
<p>To return to the case of (ing), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963947011432051">Campbell-Kibler’s (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963947011432051">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947011432051">2011)</xref> work suggests that previous variationist accounts may have significantly underestimated the social meanings associated with this variable. Campbell-Kibler used an adapted version of the matched-guise technique to collect social evaluations of short extracts which were digitally manipulated to include various tokens of (ing). Her results demonstrate that listeners were able to access multiple meanings, such that (ing) could index the speaker’s background, character, mood and specific situational stance. Furthermore, these meanings were not fixed but relied upon the listeners’ reactions to the speaker overall. In one instance, she found that a speaker could be variously described as ‘compassionate’ or ‘condescending’ dependent upon whether or not she was perceived as a ‘natural’ user of -<italic>in</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963947011432051">Campbell-Kibler, 2008</xref>: 645–648).</p>
<p>Campbell-Kibler’s work exposes the difference between the social significance variationists ascribe to linguistic features and those constituted by language users in interaction. Outside of the variationist word-list, language features rarely occur in isolation: they are produced alongside other linguistic features by speakers exhibiting particular affects or characteristics, which may or may not correlate with their socio-economic classification. Consequently, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0963947011432051">Podesva and Chun (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963947011432051">Johnstone and Kiesling (2008)</xref> have observed, the social meaning of a linguistic feature is typically underspecified until it enters into a speaker’s or a group’s social practice. The indeterminacy of social meaning has been found in a number of studies that employ ethnographic methodologies. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0963947011432051">Rindal (2010)</xref> finds that Norwegian adolescents attribute social qualities to American and British English norms, which take on particular local salience in an L2 context. Whereas American English is perceived as more socially attractive, British English is considered to encode status and prestige. These perceptions are shown to motivate speech production, with speakers using more American English features in peer conversations and more British English features in formal interactional contexts. Whilst the meanings constructed undoubtedly draw upon global ideologies about the relationship between American and British English, the adolescents in Rindal’s study recruit these varieties to differentiate interactional styles specific to their day-to-day interactions in Norway.</p>
<p>If we accept that the social meaning of a linguistic feature is embedded in the specific context of its use, then we situate its meaning relative to the other social or linguistic features with which it co-occurs. Several sociolinguists have now argued that this ‘socially meaningful clustering of features within and across linguistic levels and modalities’ is the true definition of style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947011432051">Campbell-Kibler et al., 2006</xref>, but see also: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947011432051">Auer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963947011432051">Bucholtz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947011432051">Coupland, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947011432051">Eckert, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947011432051">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963947011432051">Moore, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963947011432051">Podesva, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0963947011432051">Zhang, 2008</xref>). This moves away from the narrow formulation used in much traditional variationist work and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963947011432051">Irvine (2001)</xref> has noted, provides a definition of style which is much more in line with how style is defined in other disciplines, such as anthropology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963947011432051">Lévi-Strauss, 1966</xref>), sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963947011432051">Hebdige, 1979</xref>), cultural theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947011432051">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963947011432051">de Certeau, 1984</xref>) and, of course, stylistics. By this definition, there is no taxonomic distinction between dialect and style: it’s all style.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947011432051">Coupland’s (2007a)</xref> monograph, <italic>Style: Language, Variation and Identity</italic>, provides a powerful illustration of the scope of this approach to style. Coupland exposes the limitations of traditional variationist work and demonstrates how stratification models limit our understanding of concepts such as ‘standard’ and ‘non-standard’ language varieties. By exploring the effects of audience, ideology, language attitudes, genre, and context, he shows that language is a resource for identity styling (rather than simply a reflection of one’s place in the social order). However, it is important to note that Coupland explicitly situates himself outside the variationist paradigm and, in doing so, implies that other kinds of sociolinguistic method are required to access stylistic meaning. Whilst it is true that variationists have much to learn from other sociolinguists, there is still much that variationist work can add to our understanding of style. In this article, I show how giving style the social life it deserves can enrich, rather than detract from, the type of work variationist sociolinguists do.</p>
<p>In order to present a contemporary account of variationist work, it is necessary to review some of the techniques and devices employed in the field. Viewing social meaning as embedded in styles raises questions about the validity of analysing individual linguistic features in isolation. This has implication for what we designate as ‘the linguistic variable’ and the type of linguistic features that variationists might choose to analyse. I elaborate on these concerns in the next section, before going on to present some data which will illustrate how variationist work is evolving.</p>

<title>2 Style and the linguistic variable</title>
<p>Labov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963947011432051">1972</xref>: 323) defined the linguistic variable as two or more ‘ways of saying the same thing’; thus the reliability of language change observations depend upon the assumption that, of the variants studied, one is overtaking another to ‘say the same thing’ within a given speech community. However, when we take a holistic view of how language features function, it is not clear what counts as ‘the same thing’. Labov’s definition is clearly based upon semantic equivalence, ‘in a truth conditional sense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0963947011432051">Weiner and Labov, 1983</xref>: 30). However, as Romaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0963947011432051">1984</xref>: 425) has noted, ‘[r]eference is but one of the many functions of utterances’. Where a feature occurs in the speech of two social groups, it does not necessarily follow that the feature signals the same social meanings when used in the discourse of each distinct group – whether or not there are frequency differences in the distribution of variants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963947011432051">3</xref></sup> This has been shown in recent work on English speakers of Pakistani heritage. Several studies have shown that retroflex or postalveolar realizations of syllable-initial /t/ stereotypically mark British Asian English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963947011432051">Kirkham, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963947011432051">Lambert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0963947011432051">Sharma and Sankaran, forthcoming</xref>). However research that studies how this feature enters into the practice of different groups of British Asians suggests that it may work to signal quite distinctive local meanings dependent upon the geographic location of speakers and the practices in which they engage. For instance, in his work in a Sheffield high school, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963947011432051">Kirkham (2011)</xref> finds that the /t/ of Asian speakers is characterized by a shorter and louder burst with a more retracted articulation than that of White speakers. He hypothesizes that this difference is employed stylistically by the high school students to signal social group membership which is largely ethnically constrained. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947011432051">Alam (2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947011432051">Alam and Stuart-Smith, 2011)</xref> finds a similar ethnic correlation in a Glasgow high school, but her ethnographic fieldwork enables her to observe further intra-ethnic variation within the Asian community, with some Pakistani speakers making more or less use of this distinctive articulation on the basis of their social and religious practices. Thus, the meaning of the various articulations of syllable-initial /t/ is determined by the wider style in which this feature occurs.</p>
<p>Kirkham and Alam’s studies illustrate the importance of distinguishing between the significance of frequency differences in the use of ‘variants’ and the significance of the meaning of ‘variants’ themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963947011432051">Lavandera, 1978</xref>: 174). This point has also been made by Campbell-Kibler, who suggests that by focusing upon the ‘variable’, we may have mischaracterized how social meanings are cognitively stored. She demonstrates that the different variants of (ing) have distinct meanings which don’t necessarily operate oppositionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947011432051">Campbell-Kibler, 2011</xref>). Whilst <italic>-ing</italic> makes some speakers sound more articulate, intelligent and educated, and <italic>-in</italic> makes them sound more casual, it does not follow that the reverse is true (that is, that <italic>-ing</italic> sounds less casual or <italic>-in</italic> less articulate, intelligent or educated). She concludes that ‘[d]espite their intimate linguistic relationship, these two forms appear to be socially distinct entities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947011432051">Campbell-Kibler, 2011</xref>: 434).</p>
<p>As variationist work turns to more holistic models of variation (incorporating both stylistic and cognitive dimensions), it becomes less easy to argue that the linguistic variable (as currently defined) is a suitable way to describe sociolinguistic variation – even if it is seen as a heuristic analytic device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963947011432051">Labov, 1978</xref>), rather than a real-world entity. The linguistic variable is perhaps best considered a historical artefact, given that it emerged at a time when generative grammar, and rule-based models dominated linguistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0963947011432051">Wolfram, 1991</xref>: 26). Romaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0963947011432051">1984</xref>: 414) notes that it would be much harder to incorporate such a concept into a categorical or functional grammar. A focus on social meaning moves us from a substitution class approach to variation (where linguistic variants compete to fill a linguistic ‘slot’) to a stylistic approach (where the manner and nature of a feature’s occurrence may be just as important as its relative frequency). Consequently, it is unsurprising that this new emphasis requires new forms of analytical practice.</p>
<p>Given that we are still in the early stages of understanding how social meaning attaches to linguistic entities, it might be better to begin our search for sociolinguistic meaning by thinking about the range of social concerns held by a community of speakers and exploring how these are embodied in linguistic styles. This approach does not tie us to the search for a poorly defined linguistic variable, and enables a fuller exploration of speakers’ social and linguistic abilities. This is important because work that focuses upon identifying variants of the same linguistic variable has the potential to underestimate the social work undertaken by speakers. For instance, if a non-standard variant is shown to correlate with working-class speakers and a standard variant with middle-class speakers, the assumption is that both groups of speakers are simply doing the same thing in different ways. However, it may be that the ‘variants’ are not equally socially loaded. For instance, in an analysis of the first person possessive singular in the language of Middlesbrough children, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0963947011432051">Snell (2010)</xref> demonstrates that the working-class children use more possessive <italic>me</italic>. However, their use of this form is particularly stylized, in that the forms contribute to stances ‘of negative affect or transgression, often tempered by playfulness or a lack of commitment to the utterance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0963947011432051">Snell, 2010</xref>: 647). In this way, possessive <italic>me</italic> is not simply an alternative to another less vernacular form, it is employed to fulfil specific interactional goals above and beyond its referential content. In this sense, it is evidence that the working-class speakers – far from being impoverished users of language – are employing shrewd sociolinguistic strategies which differ from those used by the middle-class speakers.</p>
<p>In analysing the function of possessive <italic>me</italic>, Snell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0963947011432051">2010</xref>: 647) observes that the feature ‘did not work alone’, in that it tended to cluster with other linguistic resources (such as increased pace, volume, and stress, and lengthened vowels). If we start an analysis by searching for a specific linguistic variable and its variants then we are not inured to think about the co-occurrence of linguistic features that typify sociolinguistic styles. Furthermore, the desire to identify variants which fit into a substitutional ‘slot’ means that variationists have focused upon linguistic items which fit this criterion more easily. Consequently, variables are usually phonological, sometimes morphosyntactic and rarely discoursal. However, it may be that social meaning is encoded at the intersection of these components of the grammar, and in more complex ways than have been assumed. For instance, recent work has shown segmental and intonational variation (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963947011432051">Podesva, 2007</xref>), suggesting that much more than consonants, vowels, and vowel quality can vary. The extension of linguistic domains considered by variationists is providing a much fuller account of the linguistic synergies involved in the construction of social meaning. More work of this kind will allow us to explore the boundaries of sociolinguistic styles.</p>
<p>In this section, I have summarized how the concept of style outlined in section 1 provides a more suitable way to explore the social meaning of linguistic variation than the linguistic variable, a key heuristic device used in variationist research. In particular, I have suggested that research on social meaning should aim to appraise social groups qualitatively, thus allowing linguistic analysis to be driven by the specific social concerns of the group studied. I have also suggested that analysts should be prepared to consider all components of the grammar as potentially socially meaningful. These are ambitious analytical goals. In the next section, I present some case studies, which demonstrate that they are both achievable and fruitful.</p>

<title>3 Data and case studies</title>
<p>My work on a high school community in Bolton, in the north-west of England, has focused upon the linguistic strategies used by adolescent girls to reflect and construct membership in four distinct communities of practice (CofPs).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963947011432051">4</xref></sup> The school, Midlan High, is situated in an upper working-class/lower middle-class area and each CofP exhibited different social class orientations (evaluated on the basis of the forms of practice in which the girls engaged, their contact with other communities beyond their high school, and their aspirations). The study involved two years of ethnography when the girls were aged 12–13 through to 14–15 years.</p>
<p>The four CofPs constructed distinctive and oppositional styles. Of the four, the Townies were the most rebellious, engaging in risky behaviours such as drug-taking and sexual activity and hanging out with older males in the local area. Whilst the Populars also exhibited an anti-school attitude, their activities were more moderate: they dressed in a sporty yet feminine style, would smoke and drink, and formed relationships with boys in their own peer group. The Townies and, to some extent, the Populars exhibited working-class orientations and formed tight close-knit networks. The Geeks, by contrast, were rather loosely tied and maintained most of their relationships through the school via their participation in the school orchestra and on sports teams. Finally, the Eden Village girls, named after their desirable home area, formed a closed and elitist CofP who shared shopping trips and sleepovers. They had a trendy ‘teen’ style, and many of these girls engaged in dancing as a pastime. Both the Eden Village and Geek CofPs had a more middle-class orientation.</p>
<p>Given the distinct social concerns, practices and aspirations of these CofPs, we would expect differentiation in use of linguistic strategies. From a traditional variationist perspective, this was seen most markedly in the use of nonstandard <italic>were</italic> (use of <italic>were</italic> in first and third singular contexts) which was used very frequently by the Townies, moderately by the Populars, occasionally by the Geeks and not at all by the Eden Villagers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963947011432051">Moore, 2010</xref>). However, other linguistic strategies, which are more difficult to classify in terms of the notion of the ‘linguistic variable’ (and also in terms of a hierarchical notion of ‘prestige’) showed more complicated patterns of variation. Understanding the social function of these features required a deeper understanding of the distinctive social concerns, and corresponding social styles, of the speakers analysed.</p>
<p>One such feature was the right dislocated tag, or the ‘tail’. Right dislocation refers to the phenomenon where a clause is followed by a tag which is co-referential with the preceding subject or object pronoun. The tag may be a full noun phrase, as in example 1, or a pronoun, as in example 2.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>(1) It was good, France. (Leah, Eden Village).</p>
<p>(2) You’re a bible basher, you. (Amanda, Townie)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Discussion in the descriptive literature has tended to assign this feature emphatic, clarifying or focusing functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947011432051">Biber et al., 1999</xref>: 957; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0963947011432051">Quirk et al., 1985</xref>: 1362; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0963947011432051">Wales, 1996</xref>: 43). However, it has been suggested that expressions at the right periphery of the clause boundary are likely to have an intersubjective function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963947011432051">Henning, 1998</xref>), and this is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947011432051">Aijmer (1989)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0963947011432051">Timmis (2009)</xref> and Carter and McCarthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947011432051">1995</xref>: 151), who note that tags have ‘phatic, interpersonal functions, usually in the contexts of attitudes and evaluations’.</p>
<p>Unlike some of the other features analysed in the Midlan High dataset, right dislocated tags were found across all of the CofPs studied. They were also found across corpora from another northern study of schoolchildren’s language, conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0963947011432051">Snell (2008</xref>; see also section 2 of this article). Snell undertook a 15-month ethnography of two primary schools in Middlesbrough, in the north-east of England. Whereas one school, Ironstone Primary, served a lower working-class area in which the residents face significant social and economic challenges, the other school, Murrayfield Primary, was situated within a more affluent lower-middle-class area. Snell made weekly visits to both schools when the children were aged eight to nine and subsequently when they were aged nine to ten. During this time, she participated in classroom life as a teaching assistant, and also spent time with the children in the playground. This enabled her to gain insight into the children’s personalities, interests and social practices.</p>
<p>In a piece of collaborative work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963947011432051">Moore and Snell (2011)</xref> outline some striking similarities between the two corpora. In both studies, there was a tendency for the more working-class-orientated groups to use more right dislocated tags. However, a closer analysis revealed that whilst noun phrase tags were found across social groups, the higher rates of right dislocation for the working-class-orientated groups was largely a consequence of their use of pronoun tags. This was particularly noticeable in the Ironstone primary and the Popular and Townie CofP data, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947011432051">Figure 2</xref> illustrates.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963947011432051">Moore and Snell (2011)</xref> argue that the frequency differences in these tags are explained by the functions fulfilled by particular types of right dislocation. Whilst noun phrase tags may provide clarification, pronoun tags do not add anything that clarifies the referential content of the clause. This can be seen by a comparison of the noun phrase and pronoun tags in extract 3. In this interaction, three Popular girls, Sadie, Annabel and Georgia, are discussing a conversation that Sadie had with her mum, Janice, about the possibility of a fourth girl staying overnight. Sadie knows two girls called Annabel – Annabel Humphries, who is a participant in this interaction and well liked by Janice, and Annabel Harding, who is neither a participant nor liked by Janice.</p>
<p><disp-quote>

<attrib>(Sadie, Annabel and Georgia, Populars)</attrib></disp-quote></p>
<p>The noun phrase tag <italic>Janice</italic> on line 21 occurs a full 56 seconds after the last use of Sadie’s mum’s name. Furthermore, the <italic>she</italic> in the clause preceding the tag is ambiguous, given that Annabel could be referring to one of the other protagonists in the story (the other Annabel or Sadie). It makes sense, therefore, that she clarifies the reference of the personal pronoun in the preceding clause. This clarificatory function for right dislocated tags is identified by the majority of grammars which deal with right dislocation (see, for example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947011432051">Biber et al., 1999</xref>: 957; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963947011432051">Huddleston and Pullum, 2002</xref>: 1411).</p>
<p>There is no way in which we can assign this kind of function to the pronoun tag on line 20. The second pronoun does not clarify anything further about the one in the preceding clause. It could be read as emphatic or focusing (in the sense that it reinforces a negative opinion), but the most obvious function is one of evaluative positioning. This tag expresses an unequivocally negative evaluation, which explicitly positions Sadie’s mum, Janice, following her embarrassment of Sadie. The context belies the fact that this positioning is not serious: Sadie tells this story for humorous effect and Annabel’s evaluation of Janice confirms this intent. In this way, the explicitness of the positioning suggests a close bond of solidarity and intimacy between Sadie and her mother.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963947011432051">Moore and Snell (2011)</xref> found that, whilst all groups had some pronoun tags (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947011432051">Figure 2</xref>), the only pronouns which occurred robustly across the middle-class orientated groups’ data were the demonstrative pronoun <italic>that</italic> and first person singular <italic>me</italic>. Whereas demonstrative tags typically refer to actions, objects or concepts (for example, <italic>That were funny, that</italic>), first person singular tags refer to the speaker her- or himself (for example, <italic>I’m hard, me</italic>). If tags are used to evaluate, in both of these instances, the target of the evaluation is non-human or oneself; this reduces the potential for the evaluation to reflect directly upon anyone other than the speaker who utters it. On the other hand, other kinds of personal pronouns have the potential to be much more face-threatening – as illustrated by the second person pronoun example given in example 3. Why might it be that working-class orientated speakers seem more inclined to use right dislocation to explicitly evaluate and position others through their discourse?</p>
<p>In her work on <italic>Northern Englishes</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0963947011432051">Wales (2006)</xref> has written of the richness of discourse markers found in these varieties, noting that: ‘[s]uch ‘phatic’ language gives a fascinating glimpse into the richness of everyday conversational rituals and routines that both bind communities together, and in so doing distinguish one group from another’. Wales is, of course, referring to all northerners, but research such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963947011432051">Milroy’s (1987)</xref> study of Belfast also tells us that it is working class people who tend to have more dense and multiplex social networks; they are less mobile and have more ties to place. In this sense, they are that part of the northerner community who are ‘bound together’ and we might assume that the northern working class embody more of the stereotypically northern characteristics Wales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0963947011432051">2006</xref>: 26) observes: ‘they are what they seem’, that is, ‘blunt speaking and straight-forward’.</p>
<p>It may be that the working-class communities in the Moore and Snell study are at once defined and sustained by the linguistic behaviours which facilitate engagement in traditional northern working-class style. With their use of personal pronoun tags, which explicitly position and evaluate others, they are not just ‘doing something differently’ from their middle-class counterparts, they are doing something that their middle-class counterparts don’t seem to do at all. This is not to say, of course, that middle-class speakers do not evaluate others, or even use right dislocation to be evaluative (more work is required to investigate this), but Moore and Snell’s analysis suggests that there are distinctive forms of class-orientated linguistic practice associated with this feature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963947011432051">5</xref></sup> These practices do not map easily onto the traditional variationist model of feature occurrence versus non-occurrence.</p>
<p>Without analysing how specific instances of right dislocation entered into the discourse of the studies’ participants, it would not be possible to identify these distinctive uses of this feature, or identify their function. This highlights the importance of discourse context to the study of linguistic variation, something that has been shown most interestingly in Coupland’s revision of his earlier variationist study. In his (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947011432051">2007a</xref>) volume (discussed in section 1), he revisits his (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947011432051">1988</xref>) Cardiff travel agents’ study, reworking his original analysis to show that the discursive frame of an interaction interacts with the features used to construct a range of social meanings. Coupland finds that one of his participants decreases her use of features typical of the Cardiff vernacular and increases her use of technical discourse; all of which helps to constitute a professional identity in a frame where status is called into question (speaking with a non-familiar colleague). However, in a frame where interpersonal relationships are salient, Coupland argues that her increased use of the vernacular reflects and constitutes the low personal control she experiences in a conversation about dieting. In this way, he demonstrates that there is no stable oppositional meaning between vernacular and standard ‘variants’ (such that standard variants always index high status/professionalism and vernacular variants symbolize lower class/ unprofessionalism. Instead, the discourse environment determines the work that the features are able to do.</p>
<p>Considering how the social meaning of variation ‘unfolds in discourse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963947011432051">Eckert, under review</xref>) requires that we explore how syntax, phonology and discourse work synergistically, rather than independently of one another. In another piece of collaborative work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963947011432051">Moore and Podesva (2009)</xref> bring together social and linguistic contexts by examining the co-occurrence of stylistic constraints in the tag question usage of the Midlan High CofPs described earlier. Tag questions are well suited to test the potential of linguistically complex analyses, given that they can vary at the level of phonology, morphosyntax and discourse. Most of the previous work on tag questions has focused upon the latter dimension. Moore and Podesva note that tags have been reported to index a lack of confidence on the speaker’s part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963947011432051">Lakoff, 1975</xref>) or facilitate interactional relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963947011432051">Holmes, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963947011432051">1995</xref>), both of which have been interpreted as typical components of feminine style. However, the identification of other, less polite, social functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947011432051">Cheshire, 1981</xref>), suggests that the social meaning of tags may be conveyed by more than the discourse contexts alone.</p>
<p>To explore this possibility, Moore and Podesva coded for a number of linguistic properties. In terms of discourse properties, they considered whether agreement was expressed with a tag; whether the tag question overlaps with another’s turn, and if so, where; and whether tag questions occur in the middle or end of the speaker’s turn. At the grammatical level, they examined the grammatical subject of the tag, and whether or not any nonstandard morphosyntax was used. At the phonological level, they examined the realization of word-final /t/. This feature was chosen because the vast majority of tags had negative polarity and contained a contracted form of <italic>not</italic>. The content of the talk in which tags occurred (whether they occurred in talk about one’s own social group, another group or in discussion of generic matters) was also considered.</p>
<p>Moore and Podesva found that, in spite of their widely divergent social styles, the four Midlan High CofPs used tags in some discursively similar ways. All groups used tags at the end of turns the majority of the time and tags more frequently elicited explicit agreement than any other response. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963947011432051">Hudson (1975)</xref>, they suggested that this revealed a core ‘conducive’ function for tag questions. In this way, tags encourage the hearer to agree with a proposition – in the sense that it is easier to agree with an established proposition than to construct dissent against it – particularly when an interlocutor is responding to the first part of an adjacency pair.</p>
<p>However, ‘conduciveness’ was just one level of social meaning identified in the study. Variation at different linguistic levels illustrated that this conducive function could be transformed into more specific social meanings by the different CofPs. The key differences are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963947011432051">Table 1</xref>. This data suggests that, whilst all groups used tag questions to conduce, their differing styles mean that what is conduced varied greatly from one group to another. The Townies’ highly nonstandard tags position them as rebellious. Given that their tags occur predominantly in narratives about older boys, sex and drugs, they may conduce a shared viewpoint of engagement in the rebellious, vernacular marketplace beyond the school. In this way, their tags display experience, authoritativeness, aggression and active participation in a post-school world.</p>

<p>Whilst the Popular tags are also moderately nonstandard, their talk is dominated by discussion of in- and out-group status. In this way, their tags are used to describe, evaluate, and position themselves individually and collectively relative to other people in their school. The high frequency with which Populars use these evaluative and critical tags suggests that they are a key component of this group’s overall style. In contrast, Geek tags do not seem to play a key role in the management of interpersonal relationships. Their linguistic conservativism and lack of personal content suggests that they are used to conduce agreement in intellectual debate and to signal knowledge and authority. Finally, the Eden Village girls’ tags are the ones which most clearly resemble the tags identified as prototypical elements of female style. They occur in a highly engaged interactive style and have a rather standard grammatical construction. Like the Populars, they exhibit some concern with collectivity and self-monitoring, but this is articulated in a friendly, inclusive manner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963947011432051">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moore and Podesva’s work suggests that the meaning of a linguistic feature can only be fully understood if analysed in all its social and linguistic complexity. Thus, whilst all of the CofPs studied use tag questions, each appropriates the underlying function of tags – conduciveness – to different effect. These effects are achieved by variously combining the components of this linguistic feature. Furthermore, it is not the case that each component part always does the same work. For instance, whilst both the Popular and the Townie groups use a good deal of nonstandard morphosyntax, it is the combination of these nonstandard forms with different content that gives each group’s tag questions their distinctive flavour. The range of social meanings identified at Midlan High suggests that social meaning is not easily isolated in any one area of the grammar.</p>
<p>Moore and Podesva’s work also illustrates the importance of combining quantitative and qualitative approaches to data analysis. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947011432051">Coupland (2007a)</xref> illustrates, there are several qualitative techniques researchers can draw upon in order to understand how speakers use language variation to construct social meaning. However, quantitative correlations can also provide insight into meaning. Frequency may not always be significant, but it often is. For instance, where a linguistic feature is commonly associated with the speakers who use it most, that feature can often be associated with the identities of those speakers directly or with characteristics linked to them. At Midlan High, this was the case for the Popular speakers, who were identified by themselves and others as frequent taggers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963947011432051">Moore and Podesva, 2009</xref>: 468–469), and tags were seen to be a key component of the Popular persona. Whilst frequency-associations need not preclude other speakers from constructing quite distinct social meanings (as the Midlan High data shows), they are nonetheless important signposts in our quest for meaning. This suggests that quantification has a role to play in understanding the range of social meanings associated with language. Of course, quantitative data will be at its most powerful when presented alongside other types of analysis. The evidence presented in this section suggests that variationists are already benefiting from this combined approach.</p>

<title>4 Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has explored variationist work on social meaning and illustrated how the notion of the linguistic variable has restricted our ability to understand the social meaning of language. Two case studies have illustrated how we might think differently about sociolinguistic variation. The first revealed that some linguistic features have rather constrained social lives, in that they do not occur in every speaker’s repertoire. The second suggested that, even when features do have complicated social lives, the complex interaction between linguistic and social contexts means that we should not assume that they are always functioning to produce the same kinds of social meaning.</p>
<p>These case studies suggest that if we do not consider how linguistic features enter into larger styles, we risk seriously underspecifying the meaning potential of language. This has implications beyond style, identity or social meaning studies; it impinges upon our ability to explain language variation and change. Not because all (or even most) language change occurs through conscious adaptation, but because once a form has been acquired, its occurrence in stylistic activity can transform its social life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963947011432051">7</xref></sup> This transformation may affect who encounters a feature or the speed at which it is acquired across communities of speakers.</p>
<p>The underspecification of meaning may also affect what we understand about language acquisition. As discussed earlier in section 2, exemplar theory is challenging models of acquisition that separate the cognitive and the social. To explore fully the claim that speakers store concrete examples of how language has been experienced, as opposed to abstract underlying linguistic forms, it will be vital that we have an informed theory of social meaning and a sound understanding of the ways in which social information relates to language. This can only be done if we find new ways to think about language variables, language variation and social meaning.</p>
<p>Having a social life can be complicated and time-consuming, but the alternative may be rather unfulfilling. Denying style a social life is to oversimplify human interaction and, as Carter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947011432051">1997</xref>: 80) observes, ‘language users should not be idealized out of existence into some otherworldly community where everything is ordered, regular, non-conflictual and decontextualized’. In reinstating a concern with social meaning back into the variationist paradigm, variationists may have to engage in more cross-disciplinary work. After all, it is unlikely that the best insights on social meaning will come from existing linguistic theory – despite Labov’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963947011432051">1972</xref>: xiii) claim that there can be no ‘successful linguistic theory or practice which is not social’. In this sense, the search for social meaning provides all of us with an opportunity to expand our circles of interaction.</p>

<p>For a discussion of the layering of social meaning, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963947011432051">Bucholtz and Hall (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963947011432051">Coupland (2007b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963947011432051">Moore and Podesva (2009)</xref>.</p></fn>

<p>There are good reasons why the possibility that some groups are doing different things from other social groups has been insufficiently addressed by variationist sociolinguists. Evidence of social group difference has the potential to facilitate ill-informed discussion of the relative linguistic ‘abilities’ of different social groups (see, for example, Dines' unfortunate use of the term ‘communicative dysfunction’ in her analysis of variable use of ‘set-marking’ tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963947011432051">Dines, 1980</xref>: 25), and, of course, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947011432051">Bernstein, 1971</xref>). However, this is the consequence of an approach which pits standard and nonstandard variants as equally weighted alternatives. If we avoid assumptions about the status of class-correlated forms, we may find that these features encode highly functional social meanings.</p></fn>

<p>The concept ‘community of practice’ is now well established in variationist studies. It refers to ‘an aggregate of people who come together around mutual engagement in an endeavor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947011432051">Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 1992</xref>: 464). CofPs differ from other types of social aggregate because they situate individuals according to joint engagement in social practice – not just according to membership of decontextualized social structure, or social address. To be a CofP, a social group must be mutually engaged in some joint enterprise, producing a shared repertoire of practices which identify them as a collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0963947011432051">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 73–83). See Moore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963947011432051">2011</xref>: 232–234) for further discussion.</p></fn>

<p>Wales’ work suggests that pronoun tags may also be geographically defined, but there are, as yet, no data which can substantiate this possibility.</p></fn>

<label>6.</label>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963947011432051">Moore and Podesva (2009)</xref> provided extended examples that illustrate how these tag questions work in discourse. However it is important to note that they don’t claim that every tag uttered by every CofP member is designed as outlined in this summary. Rather, this outline is provided as illustration of prototypical tag questions, which are taken to be iconic performances of group style.</p></fn>
