<p>Researchers and pollsters are giving a lot of credit to the growing polarization in American society and bipartisan behavior in explaining the heightened level of racism in America. Many had hoped—or suspected—relationships among races would improve during President Barack Obama’s first term in the White House. But on the contrary, the Associated Press “Racial Attitudes Survey,” released two weeks before the 2012 election, revealed that negative attitudes toward African Americans and Hispanics have grown since Obama was elected in 2008.</p>
<p>In <italic>Race Appeal: How Candidates Invoke Race in U.S. Political Campaigns</italic>, professors Charlton D. McIlwain of New York University and Stephen M. Caliendo of North Central College, Naperville, Illinois, confirm in their introduction that “race, racism and race-based political appeals are alive and well in America.” McIlwain and Caliendo’s research expands our knowledge and understanding of how language, images, and race interact to influence election outcomes.</p>
<p>Specifically, their disciplines—communication and political science—meld as the authors go beyond Princeton University Professor Tali Mendleberg’s groundbreaking 2001 <italic>The Race Card</italic> to expand the research conversation.</p>
<p>McIlwain and Caliendo met while teaching in a summer school program at Princeton in 2008. A year later, they began talking about the similarity of race issues within their disciplines. Their expertise led to collaboration on the Project on Race in Political Communication and this book. Both are coeditors of <italic>The Routledge Companion to Race and Ethnicity</italic>.</p>
<p>In their study, McIlwain and Caliendo painstakingly ask new and different questions while testing old arguments and theories to arrive at rational conclusions. They explore the topic while acknowledging three political realities and pursuing three objectives:
<disp-quote>
<p>1) To understand how both White and Black candidates use language and visual imagery to construct race-based persuasive appeals; 2) To shed light on the way that race-based appeals from White and Black candidates affect both White and Black voters; and 3) To explore more completely the way that news media cover campaigns involving candidates of color, including the array of both negative and positive consequences such coverage may have on the voting public and election hopes of minority candidates.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From the political landscape and the empirical evidence on race appeals, to case studies in race appeal, the book’s seven chapters offer a broad analysis. <italic>Race Appeal</italic> includes dissecting the core components of political ads and the messages that contribute to their potential racist message, such as the 1998 U.S. Senate race between white candidate Peter Fitzgerald and incumbent black senator Carol Moseley Braun. Here the authors argue that stereotypes and prejudices expressed and codified in those ads greatly influence the image that candidates of color project to the voting public. Moving from the moment the ads are produced to the moment they hit the public airwaves, McIlwain and Caliendo explore what effects, if any, they have when potential voters actually receive the messages.</p>
<p>In addition, the authors studied forty different election contests to determine how newspapers frame the election campaigns of blacks, Latinos, and Asians. This analysis includes frequency of racial references, salience of racial content, story placement, racial framing headlines, and story length. Their unequivocal conclusion is that “a widespread pattern or practice of creating durable and consistent racial frames does not exist when it comes to how journalists report on federal elections contests involving candidates of color.”</p>
<p>During the last three chapters of the book, the authors present five case studies. One focuses on the immigration policy issue in the 2006 elections. Another deals with the Tennessee U.S. Senate race that racially framed news about Harold Ford Jr., a black Democrat. Next they examine the 2004 Florida U.S. Senate race involving Republican Mel Martinez, a Cuban American.</p>
<p>On the election issue of racializing immigration policy, the authors show how the consequences of racial appeals go beyond the success or failure of a given candidate, but “produces a discourse about immigration that irrationally frames how we view the issues and colors the measures we propose to solve the problem.”</p>
<p>Last, but not least, is the case study on Obama’s convincing 2008 win by “the largest margin of victory for a president since 1988.” McIlwain and Caliendo illustrate how Obama won the election in spite of America’s racism. Having celebrated Obama’s election success, the authors state, “A tremendous amount of progress is yet to be made.”</p>
<p><italic>Race Appeal: How Candidates Invoke Race in U.S. Political Campaigns</italic> is a must-read for political science and communication students seeking to expand their understanding of the role race plays in U.S. political campaigns. As a cross-discipline text, it is especially useful for students and educators involved in “talking” politics or working on political campaigns involving diversity candidates and diversity policy issues.</p>
