We sought to clarify the relationship between maternal and fetal insulin resistance and vitamin D status. This is a prospective cohort study of 60 caucasian pregnant women. Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), glucose, insulin, and leptin were measured in early pregnancy and at 28 weeks. Ultrasound at 34 weeks assessed fetal anthropometry including abdominal wall width, a marker of fetal adiposity. At delivery birth weight was recorded and fetal 25-OHD, glucose, C-peptide, and leptin measured in cord blood. Insulin resistance was calculated using the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) equation. We found that those with lower 25-OHD in early pregnancy had higher HOMA indices at 28 weeks, (<italic>r</italic> = −.32, <italic>P</italic> = .02). No significant relationship existed between maternal or fetal leptin and 25-OHD, or between maternal or fetal 25-OHD and fetal anthropometry or birth weight. The incidence of vitamin D deficiency was high at each time point (15%-45%). These findings lend support to routine antenatal supplementation with vitamin D in at risk populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>vitamin D</kwd><kwd>fetal adiposity</kwd><kwd>maternal BMI</kwd><kwd>glucose</kwd><kwd>insulin resistance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1933719112459222"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vitamin D deficiency is an increasing public health concern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112459222">1</xref></sup> Though most commonly associated with rickets in childhood or osteomalacia in later adult life,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112459222">2</xref></sup> over the last few decades it has become increasingly apparent that a lack of vitamin D has potential health consequences that reach far beyond disordered calcium regulation and bone mineralization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459222">3</xref></sup> Vitamin D receptors are distributed in a variety of tissues throughout the body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112459222">4</xref></sup> Hypovitaminosis D in adulthood has been linked to hypertension,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112459222">5</xref></sup> cardiovascular disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112459222">6</xref></sup> malignancies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112459222">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112459222">8</xref></sup> and even mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112459222">9</xref></sup>; whereas during pregnancy, adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia, low birth weight, and an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases have all been linked to low vitamin D status,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112459222">10</xref></sup> but the evidence is still inconsistent and inconclusive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112459222">11</xref></sup> There is much debate regarding optimal antenatal vitamin D levels, but the recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report suggested that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations of above 50 nmol/L be classified at sufficient, and concentrations of &lt;30 nmol/L be considered at high risk of deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112459222">11</xref></sup></p><p>More recently attention has been focused on a possible role for vitamin D in maintaining normal glucose homeostasis in pregnancy.

Our findings confirm the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in pregnant populations, particularly those living in countries at high latitudes. According to IOM cut points for 25-OHD, 28% were at risk for deficiency at outset, reducing to 15% at 28 weeks but up to 45% at birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112459222">36</xref></sup> Our cohort of women was caucasian and living in Dublin, which is located at latitude 53° North. It is established that vitamin D status varies with the season in young adults and in the elderly individuals and is known to be lower during the winter in Europe than in both North America and Scandinavia; additionally oral vitamin D intake is known to be lower in Europe than in both North America and Scandinavia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719112459222">37</xref></sup></p><p>We did not identify any significant relationship between 25-OHD and either maternal or fetal weight or adiposity; however, a relationship between maternal 25-OHD and insulin resistance was found. Those with lower 25-OHD in early pregnancy had significantly higher HOMA indices at 28 weeks, and those with lower 25-OHD at 28 weeks also had higher HOMA indices at 28 weeks though this trend was not statistically significant.</p><p>Data in the literature to date regarding the relationship between vitamin D and glucose metabolism are conflicting. Poor vitamin D status has been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes for some time,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719112459222">38</xref></sup> but more recently evidence is emerging for a role in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112459222">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112459222">13</xref></sup> The data relating to gestational diabetes (GDM) and fetal growth are less clear. In 2008, Zhang et al performed a nested case–control study of 57 women with GDM and 114 without from a prospective cohort of 953 women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719112459222">39</xref></sup> The authors found that among women who developed GDM, maternal plasma 25-OHD concentrations at an average of 16 weeks of gestation were significantly lower than controls and concluded that maternal vitamin D deficiency in early pregnancy is associated with a significantly elevated risk of GDM. They also reported an inverse association between maternal BMI and 25-OHD concentrations, though no comment on maternal or fetal adiposity, or infant birth weight was made. In contrast, Farrant et al in 2009 found no association between maternal hypovitaminosis D at 30 weeks of gestation and the incidence of gestational diabetes, impaired fetal growth, or cord insulin resistance in a large cohort of Indian mothers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112459222">40</xref></sup> Interpretation of these studies is limited by the heterogeneity of the populations studied and difficulty in determining relationships based on a single 25-OHD level at one time point and the pregnancy outcome.</p><p>Our study is strengthened by the assessment of 25-OHD concentrations and markers of insulin resistance at multiple time points and also by the addition of data on maternal, and particularly fetal adiposity, which, to our knowledge, has not been previously examined. Infant birth weight is a complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors, the addition of a marker of fetal adiposity is useful in determining whether a baby is constitutionally large or has been exposed to excess substrate delivery secondary to disruption of the normal glucose–insulin–leptin axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719112459222">41</xref></sup></p><p>Though we did note a relationship between maternal insulin resistance and 25-OHD, we did not establish an association with either maternal or fetal leptin levels; larger studies are now needed to elucidate whether a relationship between vitamin D and leptin exists.</p><p>Our study has some limitations worthy of consideration. Our cohort is just 60 women, but all had analyses at multiple time points in pregnancy and had additional ultrasonographic and neonatal assessments, which previous studies have overlooked. Our study had strict inclusion criteria: all our study participants were caucasian, living in a climate of limited sun exposure, and secundigravid having previously delivered a macrosomic infant. They are not, therefore, a representative sample of all pregnant women and it could be argued that these strict inclusion criteria limited the potential to identify a relationship between 25-OHD and birth weight. They were, however, specifically identified as a group likely to be at risk of both impaired glucose tolerance and fetal macrosomia and therefore potentially be the target of any future intervention trials of vitamin D supplementation to maintain normal glucose homeostasis and fetal growth in pregnancy.</p><p>These findings add to the growing body of evidence supporting routine antenatal supplementation with vitamin D in deficient populations. There remains, however, a significant lack of data in the literature regarding optimal antenatal dosing. The IOM specified that the intake needed to meet the requirements of 97.5% of pregnant women was 600 IU/d in those with minimal sunlight exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112459222">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112459222">42</xref></sup> Using a probabilistic distribution approach and a simulated dose response, they identified a serum 25-OHD level of 50 nmol/L as being equivalent to the recommended daily allowance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112459222">11</xref></sup> The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline suggests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1933719112459222">43</xref></sup> that pregnant and lactating women require at least 600 IU/d of vitamin D and comment that at least 1500 to 2000 IU/d of vitamin D may be needed to maintain a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 nmol/L. Further, larger randomized studies are necessary before the optimum dose of antenatal supplementation can be clarified.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings have confirmed that the relationship between maternal vitamin D, glucose homeostasis, and fetal growth is complex. Further interrogation of the relationship between vitamin D and insulin resistance is required and consideration given to a randomized control trial of vitamin D supplementation in women at risk of gestational diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the Health Research Board Ireland and The National Maternity Hospital Medical
