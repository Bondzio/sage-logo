<abstract>
<p>This article explores the processes of construction of collective identity of women activists in the state of Andhra Pradesh in south India. Utilizing methods such as the Twenty Statements Test and a semi-structured interview format with 10 activists, the study focused on their self-description as activist, formative influences on their decision to engage in activism, and their recall and narration of a significant collective action incident. Broadly, two dimensions of collective identity – sharing of a collective action frame and connection with a broader community rather than with narrow familial or personal identities – were found to characterize the way the participants construct their selves. The self-perceptions framed by political ideology and collective action experiences contained psychological overtones of subjective well-being that serve to explain in part the sustainability of their involvement with the organization.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0959353512437160" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article explores the processes of mobilization and enactment of a collective identity of women activists involved with a women’s organization in the state of Andhra Pradesh in south India. The actors involved typically have overlapping identities: (1) they owe allegiance to a women’s organization and are thereby connected to the vast ferment of the contemporary women’s movement in India; (2) the women activists have claims to the distinct political ideology of Marxism and Maoism and a political party that subscribes to this ideology. I was interested in exploring the processes of construction of a collective identity of women involved with a radical political movement and the manifestation of such identification for two main reasons.</p>
<p>First, understanding why some people come to consider social change to be a central priority in their lives and how and why some people become engaged in ‘risky, unconventional activity, when success is at best elusive and causes are often lost’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959353512437160">Croteau et al., 2005</xref>: 17) is a central concern of mine, and forms the backdrop to this project. People who work for social and political causes – often at great costs and at times under conditions of threat and danger – do so in the belief and conviction that their efforts can lead to a better and just world, and that their actions are necessary in order to bring about radical changes in the social order. For the kind of participants who are the focus of my research, their involvement in their organization carries with it potential danger, as the political party to which they owe allegiance, albeit in an indirect manner – the Communist Part of India (Maoist)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959353512437160">1</xref></sup> – is banned by the government. It follows, then, that in view of incentives of participation in the form of external rewards (status, power, money and the like) being virtually nil, the benefits of participation are perhaps more related to ‘an inner obligation to enact their politicized collective identity that pushes them towards participation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959353512437160">Sturmer and Simon, 2004</xref>: 59). The question then is does the badge of the identity and the collective action and solidarity that it involves make them ‘feel good’ and help them to sustain their involvement, despite knowledge of the risks and hazards associated with such an identity? I was interested in gaining insight into whether and how collective identification with social change goals and actions and constructions of a ‘group self’ forged in opposition to some external group (in this case, the state) help to bolster a sense of enhanced self-esteem and well-being. In short, is collective identity a crucible that helps to explain sustained involvement with a social change movement?</p>
<p>Second, primarily because of the dichotomy of the public–private spheres, political participation and power have traditionally been associated with men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353512437160">Einwohner et al., 2000</xref>). Despite societal resistance, significant numbers of women in India are beginning to make inroads into the hitherto male public domain of political participation largely because of decentralization of governance and one-third reservation of seats for women in local government bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353512437160">Indian Institute of Social Studies Trust, 2005</xref>). However, the women who are the focus of this study are in ‘double jeopardy’ by virtue of their ‘public’ activism through a not so conventional women’s group and their ‘political association’ with a party such as the Communist Party of India (Maoist), which again is not in the arena of traditional parliamentary politics and whose central aim is to capture state power through armed means. The questions that prompted this study were: what kind of an identity is formed for women in particular by this engagement with political action in the public domain? How are collective action templates and collective identity manifested in women who participate in an organization with distinct political and social objectives? Given that the organizational goals of gender equality and social change are long-term and formidable, how is their sense of subjective well-being constituted?</p>
<sec id="sec2-0959353512437160"><title>Collective identity, social activism and gender</title>
<p>Collective identity is a concept that lies at the intersection of social psychology and sociology and provides a critical link between the psychology of the individual and the structure, dynamics and function of social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512437160">Brewer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959353512437160">Hopkins et al., 2006</xref>). A common theme running through some of the social movement literature is the assertion that collective identity ‘is, at its core, a process rather than a property of social actors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512437160">Melucci, 1989</xref>: 34), is evocative of ‘a sense of we-ness’, and highlights the process through which social actors recognize themselves as a collectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512437160">Melucci, 1989</xref>: 34). The essence of collective identity therefore resides in a shared sense of ‘we’ anchored in real or imagined shared characteristics and experiences of ‘our collectivity’ in contrast to that of ‘others’, is generative of a sense of agency that can in turn be a powerful impetus to collective action in pursuit of common interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512437160">Melucci, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The implications of ‘some sense of political consciousness and collective action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353512437160">Ashmore et al., 2004</xref>: 81) that the term <italic>collective identity</italic> carries with it, is of immediate relevance to the context of this study. The term <italic>collective identity</italic> has its historical origins in classic constructs such as Marx’s ‘class consciousness’ to whose legacy the participants of my study are adherents. The term also appears relevant in this context to capture the process of ‘how structural inequality gets translated into subjective discontent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353512437160">Taylor and Whittier, 1992</xref>: 104) propelling individuals to take up collective actions to engage with structural inequalities.</p>
<p>Do men and women experience participation in collective actions differently? Questions such as these began to be raised when scholars used the feminist ‘lens’ to critique social movements for their gendered treatment (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353512437160">Biglia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959353512437160">Kuumba, 2001</xref>) and to unpack the ‘political construction of identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353512437160">Gomez Sanchez and Martin-Sevillano, 2006</xref>: 65). How gender affects women’s mobilization, strategies and outcomes in social movement organizations has been the subject of some scholarship in India, though not very extensively. For example, feminist scholars have attempted to grapple with the problematic issues of identity and gendered empowerment in the context of the recent upsurge (since the 1990s) of militant Hindu nationalism and the threats such strident right-wing ideologies and identities pose to the democratic and secular values professed by the women’s movement (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512437160">Banarjee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959353512437160">Sarkar and Butalia, 1995</xref>). These scholars observe that involvement of women in the right-wing organizations may have been ‘empowering’ both individually and collectively, in the sense of drawing them out from the ‘private’ domain to the realm of the ‘public’. However, the ideology and values espoused by these organizations raise several issues of concern as the primary identity for women is based on defining themselves as ‘strong and empowered Hindu women’ vis-à-vis the ‘enemy’ (in this case, the Muslims) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959353512437160">Sarkar and Butalia, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>At the other end of the political spectrum, armed uprisings, inspired and influenced by Marxism, Leninism and Maoism, particularly in the context of Andhra Pradesh, the south Indian state in which the present study is located, have also been evaluated using a gender lens (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959353512437160">Stree Shakti Sanghatana, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959353512437160">Vindhya, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512437160">2003</xref>). The trajectories of women’s gendered identities and their affinities with political ideologies of (radical left) organizations often interlace with each other. This results in the downplaying of the ‘personal’ (issues of marriage, sexuality, and so on) and the highlighting of themes of dedicated service to ‘a transcendent, worthier political cause that promises true emancipation’ in order to fashion out ‘a militant identity of the revolutionary woman – in <italic>harmony</italic> with her male comrade and organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512437160">Vindhya, 2003</xref>: 155). While such an objective was held as laudable in the service of the political cause, the occurrence of gendered practices in the organization detrimental to women members such as sexual abuse and the restricting of women to traditional and stereotypical roles within the organization with such instances often being underplayed as ‘individual’ instances, demonstrated its lack of concern for the feminist credo of ‘personal’ issues being ‘political’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959353512437160">Kannabiran et al., 2004</xref>; Stree Shakti Sanghatana, 1989; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353512437160">Vindhya, 2003</xref>). As these critiques have pointed, the highlighting of gendered practices inimical to women was considered to be a stratagem that would be a needless deviation from the objective of paramount importance – of ushering in social and political revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959353512437160">Kannabiran et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Such critiques notwithstanding, the primary concern spurring on the present study was to capture the <italic>construction</italic> and <italic>processes</italic> of collective identification of women within the ‘public domain of political participation’ through their involvement with an organization that is women-centric, and is connected to a movement inspired and influenced by communist ideals.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0959353512437160"><title>Locating the study in the context of social movement literature in India</title>
<p>The emergence and vitality of collective identities are associated with conditions of sociocultural change, socioeconomic or political exclusion and political breakdown and renewal, thus suggesting that they ‘cluster historically in social space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353512437160">Gergen, 1991</xref>: 21). In India, the latter part of the 20th century witnessed an effervescence of expressions of collective identity among socially and economically marginalized groups broadly termed <italic>dalits</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353512437160">Franco et al., 2004</xref>); and among women (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353512437160">Agnihotri and Mazumdar, 2010</xref>). Since the 1980s in particular, new mobilizations by women, farmers, <italic>dalits</italic> and tribal groups raised issues that pushed the concept of identity to the forefront of contemporary academic discussion as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959353512437160">Jodhka, 2001</xref>). Social movements in post-colonial India, characterized as deliberate collective mobilizations ‘to promote change in any direction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512437160">Shah, 2004</xref>: 19) have been the subject of fairly widespread sociological scholarship (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353512437160">Oommen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512437160">Ray and Katzenstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512437160">Shah, 2004</xref>). The field of social movements may be well-researched in western literature, both sociological and psychological, but is marginal in psychological literature in India. Despite the abundance of social movements and the tremendous range of collective actions in which people participate in India, psychological research in terms of antecendents, processes and outcomes of collective action is virtually absent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0959353512437160">2</xref></sup> In particular, the links between political and psychological processes are almost an uncharted terrain of research in India.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0959353512437160">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, while the history, dynamics and debates within the women’s movement in India have been extensively written about by feminist scholars across a range of social science disciplines (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353512437160">Agnihotri and Mazumdar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512437160">Kumar, 1993</xref>), there is scarcely any such engagement by researchers from the discipline of psychology. This is particularly ironic because both approaches of the state and the initiatives of women’s organizations to implement agendas of gender equity and justice currently centre on <italic>empowerment</italic>, a term that resonates with psychological overtones and that in effect is a shorthand for the distinctly psychological outcomes of self-esteem, well-being, and transformations of self-perception and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353512437160">Vindhya, forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study is located in this crucial gap of paucity of psychological approaches to understanding of collective mobilizations and motivations for involvement in the literature from India. The article, with its limitations in terms of scale and depth, does not claim to unravel deep insights about psychological processes in collective actions. It attempts only to present some reflections of women involved in collective actions, on the construction of their identities as they negotiate with the relationship of individual to the group/movement, and to draw the implications of such involvement for their subjective well-being.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0959353512437160" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>The research design included qualitative data-gathering techniques such as semi-structured interviews with the women activists, and a psychological test called the Twenty Statements Test (TST; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959353512437160">Kuhn and McPartland, 1954</xref>). The TST, an unstructured measure used frequently in cross-cultural self-concept research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959353512437160">Dhawan et al., 1995</xref>), was intended to obtain a measure of the participants’ self-description of identity, and to complement the open-ended questions of the interviews.</p>
<p>Participants were members of a women’s organization in the state of Andhra Pradesh in south India. The organization officially describes itself as ‘autonomous’ and is one among the numerous autonomous women’s groups currently in existence in the country. The term ‘autonomous’ came to refer to such groups formed since the late 1970s that were not allied to established political parties, and that signalled the beginnings of the post-Independence women’s movement triggered off in response initially to the increasingly reported violent crimes against women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512437160">Kumar, 1993</xref>). However, the group to which the participants of this study belonged did not have its origins in the autonomous women’s movement witnessed in the country since the late 1970s. Rather, its beginnings are much later – in the late 1980s – when it started off as a local group in one of the cities of Andhra Pradesh. By 1992 it had evolved into a larger state-wide formation of women activists who work with the twin purposes of pursuing explicit gender-related goals such as preventing violence against women, and of challenging the nature of state power itself, for instance, through protest actions against certain socioeconomic policies of the state.</p>
<p>Further, unlike other autonomous women’s groups that are not allied with any political party, this group is broadly associated with the radical left and the Communist Party of India (Maoist). The links between the women’s organization and the political party it is broadly allied with are however, not explicitly defined – perhaps strategically, as overt association with a banned political party might invite state reprisal. It must be emphasized that the organization to which the women are presently associated, is <italic>not</italic> banned or in any way proscribed by the government; it is a publicly well-known organization, and the women well-identified in the public domain for their activism. Many of them routinely give media interviews, and are in the news for their public actions. Given their oppositional views and campaigns, they do experience resistance from the state in terms of occasional detention/arrest, but it is not similar in any way to the extent of state repression faced by members of the political party whose ideology they subscribe to. Therefore, the research study did not violate ethical concerns of placing the respondents in potentially unsafe conditions because of their participation in the study. Participants were recruited through personal contact; eight of the 10 participants were known to me by virtue of my association with the women’s and human rights movements in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The remaining two were recruited through snowballing from those who had already participated. My familiarity was a distinct advantage to me not only in gaining access to participants but also in enabling them to open up to me without apprehensions of violations of confidentiality.</p>
<p>Ten women in all participated in the study. Their ages ranged from 27 to 75, with the average age of the participants being 45 years. There was a wide-ranging difference in their educational levels, too; one participant had no formal education but had taught herself some rudimentary reading and writing after joining the organization, four participants had a master’s degree while the remaining five had a bachelor’s degree.</p>
<p>Since formal institutional ethical review of social science research is not a mandatory requirement in India, ethical research practice was adhered to through the following practices. Informed consent was obtained in advance after explaining the nature of the research project to each participant, including that the project was not aimed at examining or interrogating their political ideology and beliefs, and addressing any safety concerns. Participants were assured their responses would remain confidential. No personal identifying information such as their name or address was noted or recorded at any stage in the research process. In order to ensure their anonymity, pseudonyms were given and contextual details expressed in the interviews (such as names of the towns or cities to which they belonged, details of the actions or campaigns they described) that might make them easy to identify were limited in the excerpts quoted.</p>
<p>After the initial contact, participants were asked to indicate their preference for the setting to conduct the interviews with them. Some of them opted for their own homes while three of them preferred to come to my office. Each interview lasted between 90 and 120 minutes, which included time to complete the TST (about 10–15 minutes). The interviews were conducted in Telugu, the local language, as even the educated participants who were familiar with English were more comfortable in Telugu. All interviews were audio-taped and then transcribed verbatim and subsequently translated into English by me. The analysis was done on the English version of the interviews.</p>
<p>Participants were interviewed in an open-ended but semi-structured interview format with a prepared framework of items that was supplemented wherever necessary by prompts and follow-up questions. The framework was prepared primarily because I wanted to ensure that the same ground was being covered for all the participants. Beginning with questions about their socio-demographic background, the interviews proceeded with the following questions: (1) ‘When do you recall first using the word “activist” to describe yourself? Can you tell me about any incident/event/experience?’ (2) ‘Can you tell me about the formative influences that led you to become an activist?’ (3) ‘What are the kinds of issues/collective actions that you are currently involved with in your organization?’ and (4) ‘Can you please tell me about any one significant event of collective action and what your feelings were then?’</p>
<p>Despite the assurances of confidentiality, the participants were initially rather apprehensive and ill-at ease when the interviews began. Gradually, I realized that it was not for reasons of confidentiality or safety that they were experiencing discomfort. Rather, it was the very <italic>action</italic> of speaking about self that was indeed a novel experience for most of them. Despite their high levels and quality of articulation about social and political issues (known to me because of my familiarity with their behaviour and participation at public meetings, etc.), the very act of reflecting about themselves and their self-definition found them faltering. For instance, one participant said:<disp-quote>
<p>I find it rather odd to talk about myself. We generally talk about social issues, even when we speak to women who come to us in distress, it is their concerns that we take up, and then link these personal concerns to the broader social context of inequality and oppression … [I] have never really had a chance to speak about myself and tell my story. (Srujana)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant began by saying, ‘what is there to speak about myself … my life is tied with that of our organization’ (Sonia). However, after beginning in this fashion, many participants ‘warmed up’ subsequently and without any further prompts from my side, launched into what can be described as an intense and spontaneous expression of feelings and memories. For instance, Meena, who also worked in a private clinic, said towards the end of the interview,<disp-quote>
<p>I did not know that I had all this within me. Where is the time to think about oneself? It is this relentless pressure of work – work at home … there is no getting away from this work … work in the hospital, with patient after patient and their pain and suffering overwhelming you, then work in the organization – rallies, demonstrations, meetings … you are surrounded by people all the time … there is no time even to take your breath. Thinking about oneself is a luxury. (Meena)</p></disp-quote>The interview was followed by the participants giving their responses to the TST. The TST, used to complement the interviews, is a long-standing instrument designed to bring to the surface participants’ most salient self-descriptions. It has an open-ended format wherein participants are required to respond with 20 different statements to the question ‘Who am I?’ The advantage of this technique is that it facilitates self-description in terms of respondents’ own personal constructs rather than use those of the investigator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959353512437160">Kuhn and McPartland, 1954</xref>).</p>
<p>For the participants’ responses to the TST, two different scoring systems were adopted – that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959353512437160">Watkins et al. (1997)</xref> and of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353512437160">Alm et al. (1972)</xref>, because there is little agreement on the best method for scoring participants’ responses, despite the ease of doing the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353512437160">Chandler et al., 2003</xref>). It was also felt that by using two sets of scoring, more and wider interpretations of the ways in which the participants constructed and designated their selves could be generated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959353512437160">Table 1</xref>). According to the scoring system of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959353512437160">Watkins et al. (1997)</xref>, responses are categorized into the following: (1) <italic>Idiocentric</italic> (statements about personal qualities, attitudes, beliefs, states and traits not related to other people); (2) <italic>Large group</italic> (statements about large group memberships where many people are involved, and with whom people share a common fate); (3) <italic>Small group</italic> (as above but for small groups, usually the family); and (4) <italic>Allocentric</italic> (statements about interdependence, friendship, responsiveness to others, or sensitivity to how others perceive the person). In the scoring procedure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353512437160">Alm et al. (1972)</xref>, responses are classified into the following categories: (1) <italic>Consensual</italic> (statuses in social categories and social groups); (2) <italic>Beliefs</italic> (ideological beliefs, i.e. religious and philosophical orientations); (3) <italic>Aspirations</italic> (future tensed statements of personal goals and achievements); (4) <italic>Preferences</italic> (Respondents’ interests and aversions); and (5) <italic>Evaluations</italic> (self-evaluation, i.e. evaluatory statements assessing one’s own mental and physical abilities and demeanour).

<p>The interview data were analysed following the principles of thematic analysis, which promotes a discursive interpretation of the data through focusing on meaning, and an inductive approach in particular to thematic analysis, which allows themes to be identified from the data, rather than searching for themes that are theory-driven and pre-defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959353512437160">Boyatzis, 1998</xref>). The method includes coding for prominent themes, and then naming and defining the themes. The series of steps undertaken in the analysis consisted of reading each sentence in the transcript related to each question, underlining significant words and phrases followed by grouping these terms into initial codes; sorting the codes into potential themes and then collecting all the relevant coded data extracts within the identified themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959353512437160">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). The identification of the central themes was the outcome of an iterative process in which I, as a researcher, moved back and forth between the various analytic stages in order to arrive at a more integrated sense-making of the participants’ experience while ensuring that the integrity of what the participants said was preserved as far as possible.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0959353512437160"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>This section presents the analysis of the participants’ responses, first to the TST, and then of the interview data.</p>
<sec id="sec6-0959353512437160"><title>What the TST responses tell us about self and collective identity</title>
<p>Analyses of responses to the TST, using both the scoring systems, suggest a profile of these activists where their common and principal self-defining attributes seem to be responsiveness to others (as reflected in the high proportion of <italic>allocentric</italic> statements) and a relative disinclination to designate themselves as members of a family (<italic>small group</italic>). Using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959353512437160">Watkins et al, (1997)</xref> system, the highest number of responses were those in the categories of <italic>idiocentric</italic> and <italic>allocentric</italic> statements (32 percent and 55 percent respectively; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959353512437160">Table 1</xref>). The least number of responses (2 percent only) were in the <italic>small group</italic> (statements about the family in particular) category. Using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353512437160">Alm et al. (1972)</xref> system, the highest proportion of responses obtained from this scoring system was in the <italic>beliefs</italic> and <italic>evaluative</italic> categories (48 and 43 percent respectively). The least number of responses recorded was in <italic>aspirations,</italic> denoting future-tensed statements of personal goals and achievements that drew a near blank with only two responses (e.g. <italic>I will achieve what I want to do; I want to be free and liberated like a bird).</italic>Taken together, participants’ statements about ‘self’ seem to be based on a higher level of aggregation related to feelings of social responsibility, concern for others, solidarity and a sense of ‘we-ness’. The high number of <italic>allocentric</italic> and <italic>beliefs</italic> responses given by the participants, not unexpectedly, is perhaps illustrative of a collective identity emerging from these higher levels of aggregation and is suggestive of rather fluid boundaries between the self and others and the coalescence of self-interest and collective interest.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0959353512437160"><title>Themes in activist women’s accounts of their lives and collective activism</title>
<p>Four overarching themes seemed to convey the essence of the participants’ accounts of their engagement with activism and to also reflect the researcher’s interpretative frameworks: (1) Becoming politicized; (2) Family at variance with activism; (3) Collective action frame of ‘social justice’; and (4) Subjective power and collective strength. Since the interview questions that were asked of the participants were fairly direct, some of the themes identified were descriptive themes on a manifest level (e.g. the themes labelled <italic>Becoming politicized</italic>) while some were on a more latent level, i.e. patterns that were a reflection of what underpins political activism and identity construction such as <italic>Collective action frame of ‘social justice’</italic>; and <italic>Subjective power and collective strength</italic>. In the interview extracts presented below, where ‘…’ appears, it indicates that text not relevant to the focus of the analysis has been removed.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0959353512437160"><title>Becoming politicized</title>
<p>The process of emergence of political consciousness in the participants was illuminated by their accounts of formative influences that included the environment at home in their early years, the motivating influence of literature and literary discussions, and peer influence.</p>
<p>The environment at home included references to the participants’ parents (both or either of them), the influence of their ideological beliefs, and the charged political environment of the times. The respondents who had taken to activism since the late 1980s recounted childhood memories of accompanying parents to meetings, and witnessing their subversive activities, such as providing shelter to political activists on the run from the police during the national Emergency imposed in the country in 1975–77. In addition to the atmosphere at home, frequent references were made to the social networks of solidarity and support that were seen as serving as buffers against the uncertainties and tensions the family experienced during those times, as seen in Sonia’s interview:<disp-quote>
<p>My father had been imprisoned during the Emergency because of his political beliefs. I remember the once-a-month visits to the jail with my mother and sister. I was scared of the police, the men in uniform shouting at us, and the sweaty, moist hands of my sister, whom I held tightly. We were not alone during that period … many of my parents’ friends and associates had been imprisoned … so we did not feel lonely and there were always people in the house … When I recall that atmosphere at home during those days, I feel good, I feel that influenced me a lot … it made me determined to do something for <italic>samajam</italic> [society].</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, the spirit of courage demonstrated by Sonia’s mother in the face of personal adversity as fallout of political beliefs is seen as germane in awakening political consciousness:<disp-quote>
<p>But what I remember most … all through those months … was the courage of my mother … she held us all together, she never cried, she told us we should be proud of our father and what he stood for.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For the generation of participants who had taken to activism in the decades of the 1970s, it was the social and political upheavals created by the Telangana uprising in the erstwhile princely state of Hyderabad during the late 1940s through early 1950s that served as a lasting influence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0959353512437160">4</xref></sup> This is how Mallika termed the ‘buzz’ of the charged environment that was all around, that turned out to be a powerful formative influence on her:<disp-quote>
<p>I was only a child when the Telangana movement was going on. I did not understand what it was all about, but my parents were busy … lots of people in and out of the house … I remember going for meetings with my parents, singing songs … being sent as messenger with letters to others in the village and sometimes even to the next village. It was this <italic>porata vaatavaranam</italic> [an environment of struggle and activism] that led me on to this path.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Political and other literature was another formative influence in developing political consciousness:<disp-quote>
<p>the discussions that used to take place at home … on Marxism, literature … the first book that I remember reading those days was Gorky’s <italic>Mother</italic> … it was a Telugu translation … and [I] remember feeling so charged. (Leila)</p>
<p>I used to read Sri Sri’s [Telugu revolutionary poet] poetry, it stirred me so much … I began to read Marxism, after I joined the Marxist study circle in our town … (Uma)</p></disp-quote>As the excerpts cited above illustrate, the impact of the early formative influences was recalled with a sense of nostalgia and pride by the participants and acknowledged as a powerful source of their political baptism. However, the many ways in which they learnt lessons in gender discrimination through their own experiences of disempowering practices of the family served to instil in them the belief that the goals of social change to be ushered through the ideologies of Marxism and Maoism need to be coalesced with those of feminism (or the term ‘equality of women’ as they preferred to use). The following section illustrates how inequities within marriage and family often seemed to be conflicting with the practice of activism.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0959353512437160"><title>Family at variance with activism</title>
<p>In rather sharp contrast to the warm memories of their growing up years, and of their attributions to the influential role of the surge of political events and their parents’ political involvement as pivotal to their construction of activist identities, participants sounded discordant notes with regard to marriage. The disproportionate burden of care giving that the marital role of wife entailed led Bani to view her own life situation as well as those of women in general with a ‘gender lens’ when she said: ‘Caring for others without a thought for self seems to be the fate of so many women in our society.’ Her long experience of demands of care giving, first to her sister’s children and then to an ailing husband is filtered through the gender prism once again as she perceives such a life as somehow limiting the scope of political activism. The following extract also reveals how her experience of gender discrimination – by being denied the right to education, by being married off early (and in fact of being married below the legal age of marriage for girls at 18 years), by having to play foster mother to her sister’s children despite being barely a child herself – served to propel her to regard political activism and collective action as necessary for social change:<disp-quote>
<p>I was married off at a young age to my sister’s husband after she died, and was forced to be mother to her three children … I wanted to study further, go to college … but all my dreams were torn to shreds … my husband later fell seriously ill and I was forced to look after him as well … where could I even think of being involved in any political activity? … Because of my own experience, I wanted to do something for other women … (Bani)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Responsiveness to others has been characterized as a defining feature of collectivist cultures such as India with its emphasis on social obligations, filial duties and embeddedness in social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959353512437160">Kakar, 1996</xref>). Participants’ apparent lack of inclination to identify themselves with the family (as shown in their TST responses) was in rather stark contrast to the perceived supremacy of family in the Indian context wherein the very nature of the self is said to be envisaged as ‘familial’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959353512437160">Dhawan et al., 1995</xref>). Although the participants chose not to self-identify themselves as ‘feminist’, but rather in bland terms such as ‘women’s group activist’ or ‘social organization activist’, the feminist consciousness of regarding family as an institution of power imbalances (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512437160">Kumar, 1993</xref>) seems to have permeated into several of the participants, as the following interview extract reveals. This excerpt not only throws light on conflicted interpersonal relationships with husbands/partners, but also suggests how work <italic>with</italic> the organization, <italic>for</italic> others, and for others perceived as needy of justice, served as the principal mechanism to cope with marital conflict:<disp-quote>
<p>After all the years of my troubled past … although my husband has full knowledge of it … he said I had not been able to overcome my upper caste notions of arrogance … this hurt me terribly. What did I do to deserve this? What have I not done to bend over backwards for more disadvantaged people? But I was determined not to let this cast a shadow … I let it pass, I told him I will not respond to his allegation as it can precipitate matters further. I decided to plunge with more intensity into my work … my work for other women, for social justice is important, it is my social responsibility. In fact this is the only way … work, work is the key … when you are feeling low, when the closest people let you down, hurt you … (Bani)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, in Meena’s recall of early memories and influences, there is pride about what her parents stood up for and their political convictions, and the impact these had on her, but the memories are also tinged with gendered notions of unequal division of labour and domestic responsibilities that probably received the label of ‘feminism’ later:<disp-quote>
<p>I think there were about two people who were on the run since my parents told us not to tell anyone that we had them in our house … both of them were men … I remember my mother sending me with cups of tea and meal plates to the room where they stayed. My father told me they were heroes. But I do remember that my mother had to work harder at home, cooking extra food and making so many cups of tea. My father never helped with the kitchen work … feminism had not yet come <italic>[laughs]</italic>. (Meena)</p></disp-quote>The construction of self-identity as a political activist seems therefore to be ‘multiply determined’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512437160">Capdevila, 2010</xref>: 536), created initially by the politically charged atmosphere at home in the formative years and the influence of political events, people and books, of both parents or of the father being a role model, but also sieved through the disempowering impact of discrimination for being born as a woman. The interview narratives give us a glimpse of how women’s political identity was created by the impact of ‘politics’ around them, of political ideals and ideas. But what can also be traced through the interviews is their indictment of the family as an institution that creates and perpetuates inequalities and of marriage as not lending itself to democratic and egalitarian relationships and roles. Complementing with what was expressed in the interviews is the fact that participants gave the least number of responses in the TST to <italic>small groups</italic> (to the family in particular). This indicates perhaps the disinclination to view themselves in narrow familial roles, and correspondingly, the projection of their selves in larger and perhaps more empowering terms of socially responsive activists vesting in themselves the power to bring about change.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0959353512437160"><title>Collective action frame of ‘social justice’</title>
<p>Holding the responses of the participants together was perhaps the overarching collective action frame of ‘social justice’. Their self-description as activist appeared to hinge on the template of ideological beliefs of social justice or the idea of creating an egalitarian society or institution that is based on the principles of equality and solidarity, that understands and values human rights, and that recognizes the dignity of human beings. All the respondents except two seemed to have been drawn into activism spurred by this ‘interpretative package of injustice’ of social conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959353512437160">Polletta and Jasper, 2001</xref>). Underwriting participants’ reconstruction of their memories of their first experience of activism were responses that indicated a sense of taking initiative, of taking up an ideological position in response to a specific issue of injustice, discrimination or violence, and of being a part of a large collectivity. For instance, Sonia said:<disp-quote>
<p>The news of the gang rape in a train … Leaflets were being distributed in our neighbourhood … about a protest rally being organized by some organization, I read it and wanted to go and participate in this protest rally, this is the least I could do, I thought, compared to the horror of what that poor girl must have gone through … I didn’t want to keep quiet, I wanted to raise my voice against such injustices and violence that women so routinely face …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The sense of taking initiative, not only in participation in collective action such as rallies and meetings, but also in ensuring some form of justice to the victim through punishment of the perpetrator is conveyed in the following extract:<disp-quote>
<p>Rape of a young girl in the town … I was so saddened and incensed … I heard that the police had not arrested [the man] … I went from door to door in my neighbourhood … gathered women … we all went marching to the police station to demand arrest … shouted slogans … police had to bend … by evening they arrested … (Bani)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant, Srujana’s, initiation into activism was in the context of the centre staging in public consciousness of an explicit and visible symbol of women’s oppression in the 1980s – ‘dowry deaths’. Narrating how ‘organizing people to highlight ‘dowry death’ of a woman reported in the local newspapers’ had galvanized her into social activism, Srujana said:<disp-quote>
<p>There was torrential rain that day … my friend S asked me to help her in mobilizing people to participate in a protest rally against the death of … this was perhaps the first instance of a dowry death reported in the city … I was filled with outrage … that morning, we went to schools and colleges, met students and teachers, spoke to them and asked them to join our rally and participate in the meeting … we told them this was one way of making sure that women do not get treated in such a grossly unjust manner … the entire experience of that day made me determined to continue with such work … against social injustice.</p></disp-quote>While the issue of violence against women as a manifestation of social injustice was a major template in participants’ identity construction as activists, there were other issues too – of labour, housing, and of violation of rights of free speech and assembly – indeed of a spectrum of concerns revolving around perceived inequitable distribution of privileges and advantages across social groups. Uma, for instance, recalled that ‘her initiative and efforts to help form a trade union’ in the media organization that she was working with, and against ‘malpractices of her employers like not paying fair wages’ reflected the need to engage in collection action against injustice and exploitation.</p>
<p>The conceptual frame of ‘social justice’ in the participants’ narratives appears to also reflect the historical shifts in the women’s movement’s understandings of organizational goals and actions. For instance, while many of them spoke of Marxist ideology as a motivating influence in their formative years for taking up activism (discussed in a later section), their participation in a women’s organization meant that in the 1980s and early 1990s, their actions were mostly directed towards violence against women – the earliest issue to trigger off the women’s movement in post-Independence India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353512437160">Kumar, 1993</xref>). Participants spoke of how in the context of new economic policies of liberalization introduced since the 1990s, their concept of ‘activism’ had evolved from working on issues such as violence as a symbol of patriarchy to a broad spectrum of intersectional themes of social, economic and political injustice that impact on women’s lives. They spoke of protest actions against ‘the recent policy of the government to create enclaves called Special Economic Zones’ (Srujana), ‘construction of a seaport and consequent displacement of the fishing community’ (Indu), ‘the mining policy and environmental hazards’ (Uma) to legal awareness for disadvantaged communities of <italic>dalits</italic>’ (Sonia). Indeed, as Anita termed it:<disp-quote>
<p>All issues are women’s issues … our task is to make women politically conscious of their rights … more importantly, to make them politically aware about developments in society and economy, about what is happening around.</p></disp-quote>The interviews seem to point to two key dimensions of collective political action – ideology and instrumentality. For the participants of this study, the self-description of activism seemed to have stemmed from the leftist ideology of Marxism, seeds of which were laid in a formative period and that appear to have taken root with their initiative and agency to take part in collective action. When Sonia, for instance, spoke of how ‘initiating protest actions against sexual harassment of a girl student by the college principal’ was her first step towards activism, she also revealed how the entire process of joining in the efforts made by the students to ‘speak up against authority’ had made her ‘feel part of a group committed to social change’. This shared sense of solidarity, internalization of a ‘collective consciousness (political interpretative frameworks, relational networks and goals) and [creation] of a culture of direct opposition to the direct order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353512437160">Taylor and Whittier, 1992</xref>: 103) that the term <italic>collective identity</italic> conveys seems to be in play, in the interview extracts presented above. Although the overarching <italic>collective action frame</italic> seemed to be broadly derived from Marxist ideology, the subtext in this frame was the references to gendered consciousness about women’s unequal social position, in the family in particular, as the excerpts presented in the <italic>Family at variance with activism</italic> theme indicated. While care giving responsibilities in the marital family seemed to be perceived as restrictive, the women activists appeared to draw a sense of self-efficacy from the collective actions they initiated and engaged in, as the following theme illustrates.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-0959353512437160"><title>Subjective power and collective strength</title>
<p>Building autonomy and competence – not for individual goals but for service of others – seemed to be crucial ingredients of psychological well-being for these women, as the following interview extracts suggest. Uma spoke of how her ‘initiative and skills led to the arrest of the accused’; similar was the sense of self-assertion in Sonia’s account when she narrated how she ‘used [her] legal education to make others aware of their rights’. References to autonomy and competence were articulated frequently to highlight how they are essential qualities for leadership roles and organizational functions. Leila for instance, spoke of how she ‘had organized a meeting of around 50,000 people so well’; Sonia referred to an incident when ‘hundreds of people gathered when [she] sent a message’; Mallika, recalling an incident during the early years of her activism, said that ‘thousands of people who came for our meeting made me so proud’.</p>
<p>Expressions suggestive of their individual subjective power and strength such as Meena’s statement that her name is invoked ‘to deter husbands from beating wives’, and Bani’s that she found herself ‘a heroine overnight’ need to be viewed in the context of their perception of the effectiveness of <italic>collective</italic> agency in changing unjust social conditions. Undergirding the participants’ accounts of their activism was an unmistakable flavour of collective strength and feelings of self-efficacy. For instance:<disp-quote>
<p>We were shouting slogans so loudly … we didn’t yield when the secretary [to the District Collector] came and offered to take our memorandum … finally the District Collector himself had to come out. (Roja)</p>
<p>When we formed a circle, holding hands, we stopped the traffic on the highway … I felt my heart would burst seeing the swelling crowds forcing the police to order a re-postmortem. (Srujana)</p></disp-quote>The importance of a collective action orientation was evident in Leila’s statement that ‘People together can bring [about] change’; in Roja’s ‘There is strength in like-minded people coming together’; and in Bani’s ‘When we go as a group, the police fear us’.</p>
<p>The perception that their actions stem from a political ideology such as Marxism, and that their organizational goals are linked to those of social justice seemed to be linked to feelings of subjective well-being, as the following excerpt indicates:<disp-quote>
<p>Marxism is the tool … this ideology helps us to struggle against gender discrimination. I’m hopeful that using Marxist principles of struggle will bring about social change, I draw my strength from this conviction … (Uma)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>How collective self-esteem (or the extent to which an individual’s social groups are valued and compared favourably to other comparable groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959353512437160">Crocker and Major, 1989</xref>) feeds into the individual’s overall sense of worth and positive self-concept is seen in excerpts such as the following:<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, I know the police are always on the look out to foist some case or the other … the state’s record of repression is well-known … but still, I am proud to be part of this glorious movement … we are here only to help the poor and oppressed get justice … and women form such a big part of the oppressed … Yes, I am afraid at times but I overcome my fear when I think of the good the movement does … the state with all its repressive might cannot crush us. (Roja)</p></disp-quote>Clearly a collective identity in which the boundaries between ‘us’ and ‘them’ (in this case, ‘them’ referring to the agencies of the state) are unambiguously drawn, and in which there is an associated sense of moral virtue (as reflected in Meena’s statement that she is ‘proud to be part of this glorious movement’) is a potent collective identity. Such expressions also seem to underline the observation made by others that the degree of emotional investment embedded in the process of collective identity enables individuals to feel as if they were part of a common unity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353512437160">Melucci, 1989</xref>: 44). Especially if the primary objective of this ‘common unity’ is to challenge existing relations of domination, this degree of emotional investment is perhaps crucial for sustaining the participants’ motivation for involvement in future actions as well.</p>
<p>Looking back over her long association with the organization, Bani’s voice is laced with a sense of self-satisfaction when she says ‘this work gives me a sense of purpose, some meaning in my life’. Similarly, Mallika’s rhetorical question ‘what is life if we are not of use to society?’ is illustrative of the participants’ acknowledgement of collective action and participation as ingredients of their identity as well as their reported well-being. Collective identity for these activists appeared then to be anchored in the perception that they are part of a larger movement with goals of social justice and change, and the availability and quality of ties with similar others who work on these goals.</p></sec></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec12-0959353512437160" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Based on a thematic analysis of 10 semi-structured interviews, and responses to the TST, this article attempted to capture the construction and processes of collective identification of women activists of an organization, broadly influenced and motivated by Marxist ideology, and working on issues related to gender. The interview questions asked of the participants centred around their self-description as activist, formative influences on their decision to engage in activism, and their recall and narration of a significant collective action incident<italic>.</italic> As there were no questions addressed to, for instance, issues such as constraints and challenges faced by the participants in their collective action participation (this would have meant stretching the interviews further), the interview data did not perhaps yield a more finely textured and nuanced analysis. Despite this limitation, it appears that two key dimensions of collective identity are in operation: (1) participants’ sharing of a collective action frame that serves to interpret and explain social issues and suggest appropriate collective reactions; and (2) their ‘cognitive, moral and emotional connection with a broader community, category, or practice … (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959353512437160">Polletta and Jasper, 2001</xref>: 285) rather than with narrow familial or personal identities (as seen from the participants’ responses to the TST).</p>
<p>Indeed, participants’ many references to a sense of subjective power and self-efficacy derived from collective identity and political action are indicative of activism as a way to conduct a desirable self. The positive emotions they expressed also appear to indicate that the political identity of an activist is a satisfying aspect of their personal identity. Behaviours that can be described as civic or social engagement (signing petitions, staging demonstrations, participating in marches for social causes, meeting authorities to represent public grievances, and so on) are not only linked to their collective identity per se but are held to be appropriate and desirable actions. Thus, when a participant, Sonia, says that she feels ‘fulfilled’ and ‘proud’ that her ideological beliefs and orientation led her to make use of ‘her legal education to make <italic>dalit</italic> women aware of their rights’ her actions might be appropriately considered an outcome of her identification.</p>
<p>It appears, then, that the self-evaluation of the participants’ identity is more in terms of favourability judgements made by them about their identities and in terms of the perceived value of activism for social causes in the tradition of Marxist ideology that they believed in. It is this emphasis on fashioning a collective identity in the service of social causes that seems to contribute to their reported psychological well-being and to sustaining of their involvement in the organization.</p></sec>
