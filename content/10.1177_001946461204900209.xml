<p>Bengal is often projected as the paradigm for understanding colonial India, and considerable research has drawn on the works of the Bengali-speaking literati of the nineteenth century to develop an understanding of the impact of British rule, or the West, of modernity and so on. That has included the historiographic analysis such as that in Ranajit Guha’s <italic>Indian Historiography of India</italic> where ‘Indian historiography’ was composed entirely of only Bengali and English works, with the earliest of the former dating from 1808. Before that, he claimed, Puranic discourse had been repeating a ‘hoary sense of the past’ for a millennium (Sumit Guha. ‘Speaking Historically: The Changing Voices of Historical Narration in Western India, 1400–1900’, <italic>American Historical Review</italic>, Vol. 109 (4), 2004, p. 1087.). The book under review represents a brave attempt to correct such misconceptions by looking at a wide range of texts related to parts of the old Mughal province of Bengal and relating them to the new cultural, economic and political milieu created by the impact of a Persianate administration that was firmly installed in central Bengal by Mughal conquests at the end of the sixteenth century and further annexation 50 years later in the east. Chatterjee seeks to introduce readers to a range of Bengali texts that recognised and responded to this new setting and also to select Persian works that narrated some aspect of the history the province from that time. A translation of a late Sanskrit history of the Rajas of Nadia is also cited.</p>
<p>Chatterjee argues that ‘an exploration of the nature, substantive content and function of history writing allows us to gain valuable insights into the cultural and intellectual parameters of such societies’ (p. 3). The first chapter launches the project with a lucid outline of the political history of Bengal from the fall of the Afghan sultanate in 1585 to the installation of the English East India Company by 1765. The second half of the chapter introduces the reader to the literary world of Eastern India, looking at narratives normally read as hagiography, legend or narrative ballad as well as an outline of the Indo-Persian historical tradition. Successive chapters then consider different classes of text in terms of their being ways of commemorating the past and therefore forms of history even if they do not conform to the ‘formal, academic definition’ that nonetheless structures the author’s own explanatory framework.</p>
<p>So Chapter 2 considers the genealogical narrations that explained and described the ranking system (<italic>kulin-ism</italic>) within the Bengali <italic>k€yastha</italic> and <italic>br€hmaŠa</italic> castes into the twentieth century. Chapter 3 then considers the <italic>ma‰galk€vya</italic> texts produced mainly for the propitiation of popular deities that incorporated realistic narratives of life in their times. Somewhat controversially she includes the well-known <italic>Mahaȓaṣtapurana</italic>, a ballad that described the Maratha invasions of the mid-eighteenth century in this class. The next chapter then considers Bengali prose histories written and printed under English auspices soon after 1800. The next two chapters shift away from Bengali to works written in the waning and waxing imperial languages, Persian and English respectively. Chatterjee effectively brings out the extent to which early colonial history was dependent on Persian texts that she terms ‘Bengal tarikhs’ that sought to inform and guide the arrogant and peremptory new masters (pp. 179–80). She points out how the Persian authors’ attention to dating and chronological presentation of events led English scholars to immediately hail them as ‘history’ rather than myth (pp. 208–209). Chapter 7 considers the cultural impact of the Persianesque culture transmitted through local rajas’ emulation of the style displayed by the court of the Mughal provincial governors through the centuries. The spread of this style is discussed in the context of dress, architecture, etc., and Chatterjee also considers the settings in which it was displayed or occluded. This material appears to have no direct connection with the historiographic project. The book concludes by returning to the epistemological status of genealogical materials by referring to the hostile evaluation by leading Bengali historians and archaeologists in the inter-War period (For example, Rameshcandra Majumdar. <italic>Bangiya Kulasastra</italic>, Kalikata, 1973). Chatterjee responds by arguing that their historical commemoration ‘was articulated via the cultural and literary conventions prevalent at the time and place …’ (p. 246). One cannot but note however, that her determination of that time and place is firmly lodged in the empirical history constructed by Majumdar and his colleagues. Furthermore, the genealogical literature played a central role in determining rank among Brahmanas and Kayasthas in Bengal; rank in turn could be turned into large dowries such as the 60,000 rupees reported in the nineteenth century (Ronald Inden. <italic>Marriage and Rank in Bengali Culture</italic>, Delhi, 1976, pp. 133–35). It was even widely reported that displeased genealogists would make derogatory entries in their books to degrade households that angered them (Giriscandra Vasu. ‘Sekaler Darogar Kahini’, reprinted in Kancan Vasu ed., <italic>Dusprapya Sahitya Sangraha</italic>. Tritiya Khanda, Kalikata, 1992, p. 211). That context surely changes our assessment of these texts as simply representing social memory. Nonetheless, this book represents a valuable contribution to the synoptic understanding of many classes of text all too often studied in isolation from each other and the milieu in which they were composed and replicated.</p>
