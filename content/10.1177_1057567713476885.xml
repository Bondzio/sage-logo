<p>In the book, <italic>Terrorist Financing, Money Laundering, and Tax Evasion</italic>, the author undertakes an attempt to provide an analysis of the financing phenomenon from raising the funds to government agencies’ efforts to interdict them, and to measure and monitor the outcomes of these efforts. In the first chapter, the author deals with the organization of terrorism and the reorganization of intelligence. The author starts with the roots of religion-based terrorism in the Middle East, in the United States, in the Indian subcontinent, Northern Island and South America. And then reviews the recent developments in counter terrorism, deals with legislation and surveillance, law enforcement, and further steps in intelligence reforms. Evaluating Chapter 1, though the basic format is well structured, I am somewhat puzzled that in only six pages, the roots of religion-based terrorism are explained in such a “loose” fashion with no detailed analysis being undertaken. At least for one area, “the Middle East,” such an analysis would be very helpful. I was also considered why recent developments in counter terrorism were presented and why it was even included in the opening chapter as opposed to later chapters. I would have preferred a deeper analysis of the roots of religion-based terrorism, the key findings, what the goals of such actions are, and what are the possibilities of stopping them.</p>
<p>In the second chapter, the author deals with the problem “The source of funds,” and in Chapter 3, he deals with the similar problem of “the transfer of funds.” These two chapters are very interesting and well written. The facts and figures are nicely presented. Still, I would like to have liked to have seen a much sharper differentiation between financial crimes with the goal to finance terrorism and other financial crimes with the goal to maximize the profits of the transnational organized crime (TOC). It is not clear if this book is only written about terrorist financing or money laundering or tax evasion. Strictly speaking, money laundering and tax evasion have, only partly to do with terrorist financing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chapter 2, again, spends roughly six pages on the difficult topic of tax evasion. The extant literature on tax evasion is replete. There are several scientists who have calculated the amount of tax evasion, for example, from shadow economy activities and from classical tax evasion. Unfortunately in this article, little is mentioned about the topic and almost no figures are shown. Being an economist I am left wondering why the topic of tax evasion, which is in the headline of this book, is handled in so few pages, with so little information. I would have preferred to have read more about the theoretical approaches and empirical results of the available literature. The same holds for money laundering. There are a number of experts in the area of money laundering who try to estimate it with various methods yet very little of this is discussed.</p>
<p>Regardless of any shortcomings, there may be in Chapters 2 and 3, is in my opinion one of the best chapters covering the transfer of illicit funds, the interruption of terrorist funding, and a detailed summary of the applicable legal directive and multilateral agreements. It contains a multitude of interesting case studies in which the reader can see and learn about how this is accomplished.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, the author focuses attention on the problem of risk management and managing performance using a balanced score card. It is undetermined whether a balanced score card could be usefully applied to these difficult questions or not but at least the author makes an attempt and in principle this is an interesting approach.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 presents an international focus on the fight against financial crime, where the author deals with various regions like the European Union, North America, Asia and the Pacific Latin America, and Middle East and Africa. For all regions, the institutions, their work, and their effectiveness are described in a very detailed way. Again, more analytics would have enhanced this chapter’s message as well as a systematic approach. Chapter 6 follows the flow of Chapter 5 by dealing with financial intelligence units’ employment of monitoring resource and process outcomes. This is a quite interesting and well-written chapter bringing out interesting details. Finally in Chapter 7, D’Souza addresses the problem how to better organize the outcome of the fight against financial crime. Here for the first time, he is a bit critical about the work and effectiveness of the various national and international organizations and he makes some interesting suggestions about how to improve them. Again, some form of analysis, for example, using the economic theory of bureaucracy to explain why units do not share information with other units, would have built a stronger case for the author’s point.</p>
<p>In sum, this book is a very useful, interesting, and stimulating project. For anyone wishing to know something about terrorist financing, developments in counter terrorism, and the work of all the organizations that operate in this area, I highly recommend this book. From an economist point of view, this writing could have been even better with a more analytical and theoretical approach including testing of hypotheses and facts and figures; at least about tax evasion, money laundering, and organized crime. Although there is no sharp line differentiating terrorist financing and the income of TOC, this book contains a lot of interesting facts and figures and is really excellent in showing the relevant case studies.</p>
