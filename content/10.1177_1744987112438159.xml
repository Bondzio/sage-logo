<p>This paper presents a cogent argument for treating children and young people’s failure to attend medical appointments differently from that of competent adults. The language change from ‘did not attend’ to ‘was not brought’ is a simple mechanism for triggering a different reaction. ‘DNA’ can provoke irritation at the waste of resources or acceptance that adults can make this choice. ‘WNB’, on the other hand, raises questions of ‘why were they not brought?’ and should, ideally, lead to further action to explore this.</p>
<p>One caveat I would make is that DNA is defined as failing to attend without cancelling the appointment. From a child protection point of view, it is hard to see a sharp difference between the parent who phones to cancel and the parent who just fails to turn up. In both cases, the child is not seen by a health professional despite someone having deemed this in his or her interests. There are of course many benign reasons for cancelling appointments just as there are for failing to attend, but the same argument applies that they merit being followed up.</p>
<p>The argument in the paper reinforces the official guidance about treating children’s absence differently from adults. This raises the question of why professionals do not do what, with a little reflection, seems so important? The systems approach to investigating errors and mistakes that has been adopted by the National Patient Safety Agency encourages looking for deeper explanations than just blaming the front line practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112438159">Department of Health, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112438159">2001</xref>). This approach prompts us to ask about the factors in practice that contribute to professionals failing to take action when a child is not seen as planned.</p>
<p>Within this brief commentary, it is only possible to signpost some possible contributory factors. Is the general culture of the NHS adult-centric, creating a degree of standardisation in practice that does not allow for the distinctive features of children? Does the performance management system encourage busy professionals to prioritise other aspects of their work? Does the IT system create an obstacle – is there a standardised response to missed appointments that does not allow a professional the option of describing it in a different way?</p>
<p>It is important to avoid just adding another set of prescriptions to professionals’ workloads and another layer of guilt for not living up to best practice at all times. Efforts need to be made to identify the factors that discourage professionals from giving the issue of children’s missed appointments the attention it merits. It may be that it is just a symptom of deeper problems in recognising the distinctive characteristics and needs of children.</p>
