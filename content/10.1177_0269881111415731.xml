<abstract>
<p>Essential tremor (ET) is a relatively frequent neurological disorder that responds in some patients to gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) agonists such as the benzodiazepines. Partial subtype-selective GABA<sub>A</sub> agonists may have an improved side effect profile compared to non-selective GABA<sub>A</sub> agonists. However, it is unknown which GABA<sub>A</sub> subtypes are involved in the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines in ET. The effects of 2 mg TPA023, a GABA<sub>A</sub> α2,3 subtype-selective partial agonist, on ET were compared to the effects of a stable alcohol level (0.6 g/L) and placebo in nine patients with ET. Tremor evaluation included laboratory accelerometry and a performance-based scale. Additional measurements were performed to evaluate other effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Alcohol significantly diminished tremor symptoms in the postural and kinetic condition, as assessed by laboratory accelerometry, but the performance-based rating scale was unaffected. Tremor was also reduced after TPA023 treatment in the kinetic condition, albeit not significantly. Additionally, TPA023 decreased saccadic peak velocity, while alcohol decreased subjective feelings of alertness. This study showed that alcohol reduced maximum tremor power, as assessed by laboratory accelerometry, unlike TPA023, which decreased tremor symptoms to some extent but not significantly. This study showed that treatment with an α2,3 subunit-selective GABA<sub>A</sub> partial agonist was less effective than a stable level of alcohol in reducing ET symptoms. These results provide no support for a therapeutic role of TPA023 in the suppression of ET symptoms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111415731">Pahwa and Lyons, 2003</xref>). The age- and gender-adjusted prevalence of ET is estimated to be 3–4 per 1000, with an annual incidence of 23.7 per 100,000. Approximately 4% of adults in the age group above 40 years are affected by ET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881111415731">Zesiewicz et al., 2010</xref>). ET has a 4–12 Hz frequency that predominantly affects the upper extremities, may also affect the head and voice, and rarely affects the legs. In contrast to resting tremor in Parkinson disease, ET is characterized by postural and kinetic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111415731">Elble, 2000</xref>). Although its cause is unknown, the central oscillatory systems at the level of the inferior olivary nucleus of the medulla oblongata seem to play an important role in the pathophysiology of ET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111415731">Deuschl and Elble, 2000</xref>). Current therapy for ET includes beta-blockers, phenobarbital (a primidone metabolite), benzodiazepines, and some antiepileptic agents. Treatment is symptomatic, effective in no more than roughly half of the patients, and often limited by side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881111415731">Chen and Swope, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Preclinical and clinical studies suggested that a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic pharmacologic agent could be effective in the treatment of ET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881111415731">Louis, 1999</xref>). Double-blind studies have demonstrated the efficacy of alprazolam versus placebo in treating ET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111415731">Gunal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881111415731">Huber and Paulson, 1988</xref>). Different GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes have been identified, and pre-clinically linked to well-known effects of GABA<sub>A</sub> agonists such as sedation (α1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881111415731">Rudolph et al., 1999</xref>), muscle relaxation (α2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881111415731">Rowlett et al., 2005</xref>), anxiolysis (α2,3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111415731">Atack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881111415731">Rudolph et al., 2001</xref>) and memory impairment (α5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111415731">Collinson et al., 2002</xref>). Among these subtypes, the α2-receptor seems the most promising target for anti-tremor activity, although the exact mechanism of the therapeutic activity of GABA agonists in ET is unknown. TPA023 is being developed as a GABA<sub>A</sub> α2,3 selective partial agonist. Based on the selective properties of this compound, it is believed to be a muscle relaxant (and anxiolytic) without causing sedation and instability. Healthy volunteer studies have shown the selective effect profile in comparison with lorazepam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111415731">de Haas et al., 2007</xref>). Investigating the effects of this novel selective partial GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist on ET might reveal new information about the pathophysiology of this disease, and possibly identify a new treatment modality.</p>
<p>Alcohol, which is an indirect agonist of the GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111415731">Santhakumar et al., 2007</xref>), relieves tremor symptoms in an estimated 50–90% of patients with ET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111415731">Deuschl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881111415731">Rajput et al., 1975</xref>) by reducing tremor amplitude without affecting frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881111415731">Koller and Biary, 1984</xref>). It most likely acts via a reduction of cerebellar over-activity, which results in reduced tremor amplitude, whereas the frequency is not altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111415731">Koller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881111415731">Koller and Biary, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881111415731">Koller et al., 1994</xref>). In this study, alcohol was chosen as a positive control, using a novel clamping technique that was based on earlier publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881111415731">O’Connor et al., 1998</xref>). Ideally, a novel therapy for ET would closely approach the tremor reducing effects of alcohol. Since the duration of action of TPA023 was estimated to be four hours, the clamping procedure took place during a similar period. To maximize the power of alcohol as a positive control, only patients who were familiar with the positive effects of alcohol on their symptoms were included in this project.</p>
<p>In this exploratory study TPA023, the novel α2,3-subtype selective GABA<sub>A</sub> partial agonist, was compared to intravenous alcohol and placebo for its effects on tremor symptoms. A battery of central nervous system (CNS) function tests including body sway, eye movements, visual analogue scales and adaptive tracking was also performed. The objectives were to distinguish between general CNS pharmacodynamic effects of the GABA<sub>A</sub> α2,3 selective drugs and tremor-specific effects in the accelerometry recordings, in a relatively small study.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269881111415731">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This exploratory study was performed in a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-period, crossover fashion in nine patients diagnosed with ET, with a washout period of at least five days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881111415731">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Nine patients with essential tremor (ET) were recruited from the hospital database of the Leiden University Medical Centre, from the the Dutch Patients’ Association and by advertising in local newspapers. Subjects were informed about the content of the study during an information visit. When they had decided to participate, subjects visited the research unit for medical screening. After signing an informed consent form, they were medically screened to evaluate eligibility for study participation. A neurologist (JvG) diagnosed ET of the hands and forearms according to the diagnostic criteria for ‘classic ET’ defined by the consensus statement of the Movement Disorder Society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111415731">Deuschl et al., 1998</xref>), adapted from previous criteria established by the Tremor Research Investigation Group (TRIG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111415731">Deuschl et al., 1995</xref>), as well as a more recent study indicating the importance of kinetic tremor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111415731">Brennan et al., 2002</xref>). An isolated head tremor was not allowed.</p>
<p>Only subjects who stated a positive effect of alcohol on their tremor symptoms were included in the study. Subjects had to refrain from alcohol 48 hours prior to a treatment day and avoid caffeine-containing products for at least 12 hours before treatment. Subjects were not allowed to use their own anti-tremor medications and had to abstain from grapefruit (juice) and St John’s wort for at least 2 weeks before the start of the study until its completion, because these latter two substances have stimulating and inhibiting effects on CYP3A4, respectively. They were not allowed to drink more than six units of caffeine-containing products or three units of alcohol per day or smoke more than five cigarettes per day during the entire study period. On treatment days, the use of caffeine-containing products or smoking was not allowed. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Review Board of Leiden University Medical Centre, and performed according to their standards.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269881111415731">
<title>Study treatments</title>
<p>Each patient received a single oral dose of TPA023 2 mg or matching placebo. Also on each study day, an alcohol (10% in 5% glucose) or sham placebo (5% glucose) clamping procedure was performed. Only the person who was responsible for the clamping method was unblinded for alcohol infusion due to measurement of the breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC). This person was not involved in any other part of the study.</p>
<p>Alcohol was infused using a recently developed clamping method, in which the BrAC was used to guide intravenous dosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269881111415731">Zoethout et al., 2008</xref>). An alcohol level of 0.6 g/L was chosen, because this was expected to cause a significant tremor reduction in the majority of patients. Previous studies have shown that mean blood alcohol levels of 0.35 g/L and 0.50 g/L had tremor diminishing effects, but this was after a single oral dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881111415731">Zeuner et al., 2003</xref>). Levels of 0.6 g/L are routinely achieved during social drinking, without causing too many adverse effects.</p>
<p>In previous studies, the 0.6 g/L alcohol clamp was well-tolerated and produced statistically significant pharmacodynamic CNS effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881111415731">Zoethout et al., 2009</xref>). It was estimated that the duration of action of TPA023 would be approximately four hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111415731">de Haas et al., 2007</xref>). To optimize the value of alcohol as a positive control, a clamping period of four hours was chosen for this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881111415731">
<title>Safety</title>
<p>Adverse events, ECG, blood pressure and heart rate measurements were assessed throughout the study. ECGs were assessed with a Cardiofax, equipped with ECAPS12 analysis program (Nihon Kohden, Japan). Blood pressure and heart rate were measured with an automated blood pressure monitor (MPV1072, Nihon Kohden, Japan), showing an average value for two sequential (duplicate) measurements at each time point. All safety measurements were made after sitting in a semi-recumbent position for at least five minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269881111415731">
<title>Alcohol concentrations</title>
<p>Breath alcohol (BrAC) samples were taken using the hand-held Alco-Sensor IV meter (Honac, Apeldoorn, The Netherlands). To reduce fatiguing of the Alco-Sensor meter, a minimum interval of approximately 10 minutes was maintained between BrAC samplings, by alternating two different measurement devices. A recent study using the described alcohol clamping technique shows similar findings for breath alcohol and blood alcohol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269881111415731">Zoethout et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, no pharmacokinetic blood samples were obtained for alcohol and only the breath alcohol samples were used for further pharmacokinetic analysis.</p>

<sec id="section9-0269881111415731">
<title>Tremor evaluation</title>
<p>Tremor evaluations were performed at screening, pre-dose (within 60 minutes prior to dosing) and 60, 150, 240, 330, and 420 minutes post-dose on each study day.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269881111415731">
<title>Questionnaire/evaluation scale</title>
<p>The Tremor Disability Questionnaire was only done at screening and was executed to assess the level of disability due to ET according to the patients’ opinion. This is a 36-item, 10-minute questionnaire that was designed in 1997 for the CADET study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269881111415731">Wendt et al., 2000</xref>). It has shown substantial test–retest reliability and was validated against multiple other end points, including a neurologist’s clinical ratings, the performance-based test of function, and quantitative computerized tremor analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881111415731">Louis et al., 2000</xref>). The total score of this questionnaire ranges from 0 (no disability) to 100 (completely disabled).</p>
<p>Additionally, a performance-based tremor evaluation (PBTE) was undertaken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881111415731">Louis et al., 1999</xref>). The test included the performance of 15 activities that were scored from 0 (no difficulty) to 4 (unable to perform) by a trained measurement assistant, and the total score was converted to a percentage ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (maximally impaired) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881111415731">Louis et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269881111415731">
<title>Laboratory tremography</title>
<p>Tremor was evaluated according the methodology of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111415731">Gironell et al. (1999)</xref> using three miniature linear piezo-electric accelerometers (Nihon Kohden, MT-3T), which were attached to the distal end of a clamp, above the fingertips of the dominant arm. The accelerometers were placed at right angles to one another to enable three-dimensional analysis of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111415731">Gironell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111415731">Van Hilten et al., 1991</xref>). An EMG recording of the flexor and extensor forearm muscles was also obtained with silver–silver chloride electrodes applied 2 cm apart at the muscle bellies. The signals were amplified using a Grass 15LT (15A54/15A94), with a time constant of 1 s and a low pass filter at 100 Hz. For the fast Fourier analysis, data collection and analysis were performed using customized CED software (Cambridge Electronics Design, Cambridge, UK). The upper limb tremor was recorded in three positions, each held for a 60-s interval: (1) at rest, with the arm hanging relaxed along the body, (2) postural, with the arm held in an outstretched, horizontal, prone position and (3) kinetic, moving the hand from a set point to the nose (back and forth). Tremor was quantified by a power spectrum analysis to determine the dominant frequency peak (in Hz) and the magnitude of the accelerometer signal (absolute power of the dominant frequency peak in µV).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269881111415731">
<title>CNS measurements</title>
<p>Pharmacodynamic measurements were performed pre-dose (within 60 min prior to dosing) and at 30, 120, 210, 300, 390 and 480 minutes post-dose. Subjects underwent pharmacodynamic tests individually in a quiet room with ambient illumination. All subjects were thoroughly trained and familiarized with the tests within 14 days preceding the start of the study to minimize learning effects prior to the study.</p>
<sec id="section13-0269881111415731">
<title>Saccadic eye movements</title>
<p>Saccadic eye movements were recorded using a microcomputer-based system for data recording (Cambridge Electronics Design, Cambridge, UK), Nihon Kohden equipment for stimulus display, signal collection and amplification (Nihon Kohden Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and disposable surface electrodes (Medicotest N-OO-S, Olstykke, Denmark) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881111415731">van Steveninck et al., 1989</xref>). Average values of latency (= reaction time), peak saccadic velocity and inaccuracy (difference between stimulus angle and corresponding saccade in %) were calculated for all artifact-free saccades.</p>
<p>Saccadic peak velocity (SPV) has been validated as the most sensitive measure for the sedative effects of benzodiazepines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881111415731">van Steveninck et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881111415731">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881111415731">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111415731">de Visser et al., 2003</xref>) Previous healthy volunteer studies showed that TPA023 caused SPV reductions, while alcohol did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111415731">de Haas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881111415731">Zoethout et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Visual analogue scales</title>
<p>Visual analogue scales (VAS) as originally described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881111415731">Norris (1971)</xref> were previously used to quantify subjective effects of benzodiazepines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881111415731">van Steveninck et al., 1991</xref>). From the set of 16 scales, three composite factors were derived as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111415731">Bond and Lader (1974)</xref>, corresponding to alertness, mood and calmness. These factors were used to quantify subjective treatment effects. In contrast to TPA023, alcohol has previously been shown to affect the VAS alertness scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111415731">de Haas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881111415731">Zoethout et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Body sway</title>
<p>Body sway was measured with an apparatus similar to the Wright ataxia meter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881111415731">Wright, 1971</xref>), which integrates the amplitude of unidirectional body movement transferred through a string attached to the subject’s waist. Measurements were made every 2 min in the antero-posterior direction with the subject, eyes closed, standing comfortably on a firm surface with the feet slightly apart. In contrast to TPA023, alcohol has previously been shown to increase postural instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111415731">de Haas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881111415731">Zoethout et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Adaptive tracking</title>
<p>The adaptive tracking test was first performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111415731">Borland and Nicholson (1984)</xref>, using customized equipment and software (Hobbs, 2000, Hertfordshire, UK). The average performance and the standard deviation of scores were used for analysis. Adaptive tracking is a pursuit-tracking task. A circle moves randomly about a screen. The subject must try to keep a dot inside the moving circle by operating a joystick. If this effort is successful, the speed of the moving circle increases. Conversely, the velocity is reduced if the test subject cannot maintain the dot inside the circle. Adaptive tracking was scored over a 3-min period. Each test was preceded by a run-in period. The adaptive tracking test has proved to be useful for measurement of CNS effects of alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881111415731">van Steveninck et al., 1996</xref>), various psychoactive drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111415731">Gorman et al., 1986</xref>), and sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881111415731">van Steveninck et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The study was performed to explore the effects of TPA023 on ET compared to an alcohol infusion. Because of the exploratory character of the study, no formal power calculation could be performed.</p>
<p>Most pharmacodynamic parameters were analyzed by mixed model analyses of variance (using SAS PROC MIXED) with treatment, period, time and treatment-by-time as fixed effects, with subject, subject by time and subject-by-treatment as random effects, and with the baseline value as covariate, where baseline is defined as the average of the available values obtained prior to dosing. Treatment effects were reported as the contrasts specified below where the average of all post-dose measurements was calculated within the statistical model. Contrasts were reported along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and analyses were two-sided with a significance level of <italic>p</italic> = 0.05.</p>
<p>Body sway and tremor parameters were analyzed after log-transformation due to skewed response distribution. All other parameters were analyzed untransformed. Log-transformed parameters were back-transformed after analysis where the results may be interpreted as percentage change. All calculations were performed using SAS V9.1.2 for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Seventeen patients were medically screened after giving written informed consent. Seven patients did not qualify for the study mainly because their tremor was too mild to be quantified reliably with the laboratory tremography. Nine patients (two female, seven male) fulfilled the study criteria and completed the study. The remaining patient was on standby to replace any discontinuations, but never participated in the study. Apart from their tremor, the subjects were judged to be in good health on the basis of medical history, physical examination and routine laboratory data. Subjects were on average 47 years of age (range 18–80 years), had an average weight of 77 kg (range 62–103 kg) and average height of 175 cm (range 159–189 cm).</p>
<p>The mean (range) dominant tremor frequency at screening was 7.7 Hz (95% CI 5.4–9.4 Hz). Mean (standard deviation) scores on the Tremor Disability Questionnaire and Performance-Based Tremor Evaluation were 30 (18.2)% and 34 (30)% respectively. Two subjects stopped their propranolol treatment two weeks before participation in this trial. The other subjects did not use any treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0269881111415731">
<title>Clinical observations</title>
<p>No serious adverse reactions occurred following any of the treatments. Frequently reported adverse events included headache, sleepiness, dizziness and painful arm during infusion. Headache was the most common adverse event, occurring in five, one and two subjects(s) after administration of alcohol, TPA023 and placebo, respectively. Dizziness and sleepiness occurred in four, two and one subject(s) after administration of alcohol, TPA023 and placebo, respectively. Five subjects reported a painful arm just after the start of the alcohol infusion. All adverse events were single occasions and considered of mild intensity.</p>

<title>Laboratory tremography</title>
<p>During the postural condition of the measurement, alcohol infusion reduced maximum power of both the left–right (−31.4% [−45.9, −13.0%]) and backward–forward (−37.6% [−60.4, −1.7%]) tremor direction compared with placebo. For the kinetic condition, similar results were obtained (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881111415731">Table 1</xref>). The maximum power of the left–right direction was reduced by 19.2% (−31.7,−4.3%) and that of the backward–forward direction by 29.5% (−44.8, −9.9%) after alcohol infusion compared to placebo. These changes resulted in a decrease in average power in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881111415731">Figure 2</xref>). In the resting condition, no effects were seen in any tremor direction for any treatment. TPA023 did not affect tremor symptoms as effectively as a stable level of alcohol.</p>

<p>Although tremor reducing effects were observed after TPA023 treatment in the kinetic condition, these effects did not reach significance in this relatively small study. It is unlikely that this was due to doses that were too low. There were clear effects of TPA023 2 mg on saccadic eye movements in this study, and similar findings were obtained with the same dose in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111415731">de Haas et al., 2007</xref>). The dose was predicted to be therapeutically active for the treatment of anxiety. A positron emission tomography study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111415731">Atack et al., 2010</xref>) demonstrated that the dose of TPA023 used in this study produced substantial and sustained receptor occupancy (47–64% at ∼2 h and 34–59% at ∼7 h post-dosing). Although the required receptor occupancy for the postulated GABAergic effect in ET is unknown, these levels are consistent with the occupancy associated with the minimum effective dose in animal models of anxiolysis (44–76%, 46% and 89% for the elevated plus-maze, fear-potentiated startle and conditioned suppression of drinking paradigms, respectively), indicating that they are likely to be centrally active (Merck, Sharp and Dohme (MSD), data on file). In addition, the preliminary results of a fear-potentiated startle paradigm in healthy subjects support the anxiolytic efficacy of single-dose TPA023 2.0 mg (MSD, data on file). In the latter study, startle amplitude during threat conditions was significantly reduced when subjects received TPA023 2.0 mg compared with placebo (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0035).</p>
<p>To maximize the power of alcohol in detecting a treatment effect, only patients who were familiar with the positive effects of alcohol on their symptoms were included in this project. Patients could also have been selected on their (prior) responses to benzodiazepines or barbiturates. However, the clinical acceptability of such treatments was expected to be determined not only by the effect on ET-symptoms, but also by the individual tolerability to side effects. Moreover, benzodiazepine withdrawal can also induce tremor, which can be difficult to distinguish from recurrence of ET-symptoms. It was considered less problematic to use a positive alcohol response as a potential predictor of an effect of subtype-selective partial GABA<sub>A</sub>-agonist. Many patients report a positive effect of alcohol, but still do not routinely use alcohol to suppress their tremor. The half-life of alcohol is shorter than for most tremor-reducing medications. This diminishes the chance of tolerance and withdrawal after stopping alcohol. Since this drug also acts as an allosteric GABA<sub>A</sub>-agonist, subjective ET-suppression with alcohol was also expected to increase the chance of finding effects with a subtype-selective GABA<sub>A</sub>-agonist.</p>
<p>For treatment of ET and anxiety, similar clinical doses of benzodiazepines are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111415731">Chouinard et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111415731">Pahwa and Lyons, 2003</xref>). Early clinical studies also indicate that TPA023 has an anxiolytic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111415731">Atack et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the lack of effects of TPA023, which has a selective activity at the α2,3 subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, suggests that effects of GABAergic treatments of tremor are probably not mediated via the α2,3 subunit. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the α2 and/or α3 subtypes are involved, but that TPA023 does not have enough intrinsic efficacy to produce clinical efficacy. It is uncertain which other GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor subtypes are involved. The alpha 5 subunit is mainly located in the hippocampus, and has been shown to be involved in memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269881111415731">Wendt et al., 2000</xref>). The α1 subunit is probably the best candidate, since it is the most widely distributed GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111415731">Benke et al., 2004</xref>). Recently, the α1 subunit knockout mouse has been introduced as an animal model for ET as it exhibits postural and kinetic tremors that clearly reproduce the features of ETs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111415731">Jankovic and Noebels, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881111415731">Kralic et al., 2005</xref>). This suggests that the expression of α1 subunits in the brains of patients with ET may be abnormal. A pilot study in patients with ET, however, could not demonstrate any relation between ET and variants in the gene coding for this α1 subtype receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111415731">Deng et al., 2006</xref>). Another recent paper confirms this statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111415731">Garcia-Martin et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, other defects in the α1 subunit may still play a role in the pathophysiology of ET. Since this receptor subtype is also involved in sedation, it may be difficult to find GABAergic tremor treatment that is completely devoid of this side effect, which is particularly cumbersome in elderly patients.</p>
<p>It appeared that tremor power was largely reduced in all treatment groups in the first hour after treatment had started, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881111415731">Figure 2</xref>. After this initial decrease, tremor remained stable during placebo treatment. This suggests that tremor was enhanced at baseline, for example, by stress associated with the start of the study day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881111415731">Whitney, 2006</xref>), or that there is a substantial initial placebo effect in treating ET. The alcohol effects were still clearly present on top of these significant placebo effects. Nonetheless, a wash-in placebo infusion would be useful in future studies, to ensure a reduction to stable baseline tremor levels in this patient group.</p>
<p>Although clinical rating scales have proven their effectiveness in the assessment of ET severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111415731">Bain, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111415731">2000</xref>), the performance-based tremor evaluation (PBTE) scale used in this study was not able to measure a statistically significant effect of alcohol on ET, when compared to placebo. The scoring of the test was performed by four trained persons, which might have caused too much inter-rater variability to detect a significant effect. Interestingly, the relationship between PBTE and tremor amplitude in this relatively small study approximately complied with the logarithmic criteria, which were proposed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111415731">Elble et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In healthy volunteers, alcohol causes readily detectable increases in body sway and decreases in adaptive tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881111415731">Zoethout et al., 2009</xref>), but this could not be found in our study. This could have been caused by two opposing effects of alcohol in this patient group. On the one hand, alcohol has positive effects on the tremor itself, counterbalancing the negative performance on this task caused by alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881111415731">Zoethout et al., 2009</xref>). Similar factors could play a role in the lack of effects on body sway. Previous studies showed that patients with ET had higher baseline ataxia scores compared with healthy controls, which diminished after alcohol ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111415731">Klebe et al., 2005</xref>). As for general performance, the lack of a net effect of alcohol on body sway could be explained by a reduction of ataxia in ET, combined with alcohol-induced postural instability. This might be a reason for the difference of alcohol effects between healthy volunteers and this patient group.</p>
<p>The different effects of TPA023 in the current study and those observed in a previous study investigating the effects of TPA023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111415731">de Haas et al., 2007</xref>) are similar. TPA023 accounted for significant decreases in SPV in both studies and VAS alertness and body sway were not affected by TPA023 treatment in both sessions. The only observed difference between the two studies is an increase in saccadic inaccuracy in the current study, which was not found in the previous study by de Haas and colleagues. The higher dose in the current study might be an explanation for this phenomenon.</p>
<p>This study has shown that treatment with an α2,3 subunit-selective GABA<sub>A</sub> partial agonist was less effective than a stable level of alcohol in reducing ET symptoms. This finding suggests that the α2,3 subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor is probably of little importance in the pathophysiology of ET or in the beneficial effects of non-selective benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Additionally, the study has shown that the alcohol clamp is a reliable method for studies in patients with ET.</p>
