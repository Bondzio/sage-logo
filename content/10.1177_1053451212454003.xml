<abstract>
<p>The group of students whose primary language is not English, commonly referred to as English language learners, is one of the fastest-growing groups of students. Teachers need to have a clear understanding that English learners may exhibit internalizing or externalizing behaviors related to their language development. When English learners exhibit behaviors that impede their learning or the learning of others, educators need to develop appropriate behavior plans that consider these language-learning factors. This article describes the impact that learning English may have on student behavior, as well as the necessary design modifications for appropriate functional assessments and behavior plans for this population.</p>

<p>Approximately 11.8 million children ages 5 to 17 years in the United States speak a language other than English at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1053451212454003">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). By the year 2030, it is estimated that the percentage of English learners in schools will be 40% of the total student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1053451212454003">U.S. Department of Education &amp; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2003</xref>). With the increase in the number of English learners in schools, educators need to be prepared to meet not only the academic needs of these students but also their social and emotional needs.</p>
<p>Students from culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) backgrounds are the most likely to experience punitive and negative consequences in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212454003">Cartledge &amp; Kourea, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053451212454003">Skiba et al., 2011</xref>). School districts are challenged to meet the social and emotional needs of CLD students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053451212454003">Planty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053451212454003">Skiba et al., 2011</xref>). Behavioral problems and low attention are among the top reasons that English learners are referred for special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212454003">Abedi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454003">Artiles, Trent, &amp; Palmer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1053451212454003">Ochoa, Robles-Piña, Garcia, &amp; Breunig, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053451212454003">Rueda, Cardoza, Mercer, &amp; Carpenter, 1985</xref>). It is increasingly important that educators be aware of the impact language and culture may have on behavioral expectations.</p>
<p>In general, students who struggle with their academic skills are likely to demonstrate problem behaviors to avoid or escape completing work that is difficult for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454003">Crone &amp; Horner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212454003">McIntosh, Chard, Boland, &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>). Unrealistic academic expectations can trigger undesirable behaviors when the curriculum expectations do not match the student’s educational or language skill levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053451212454003">Moore, Anderson, &amp; Kumar, 2005</xref>). Students with a primary language of Spanish, who make up 80% of the English learner population, exhibit lower achievement as well as higher rates for grade retention, school dropout, and special education placements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212454003">Abedi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454003">Artiles et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212454003">August &amp; Hakuta, 1997</xref>). These findings may be attributed to teachers’ lack of understanding of the language learning process and its link to avoidance behaviors and student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454003">Dawson &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>). Teachers need to be able to address problem behaviors in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner that will allow students to access the curriculum.</p>

<title>Language Acquisition and Behavior</title>
<p>English language learners can feel a stigma associated with their lower English proficiency level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454003">Dawson &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>). The lack of English proficiency is a stressor that may put students at risk for externalizing this stress through problem behaviors such as fighting, acting impulsively, talking out during instruction, and presenting aggression. English learners may also exhibit internalizing behaviors, such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454003">Dawson &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Many school districts have a one-size-fits-all approach to discipline, often based on punishment methods such detention, suspension, or expulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454003">Crone &amp; Horner, 2003</xref>). As student diversity in schools increases, this approach likely will not meet the needs of all students. Students who come from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, including students with disabilities, may not respond to the traditional types of behavior supports implemented by school personnel. Educators should consider modifying commonly used behavior management techniques based on social, academic, and language needs to more effectively support English learners. Understanding the impact language development may have on behavior, as well as designing culturally and linguistically responsive behavior plans, allows teachers to appropriately identify students with behavioral disabilities as well as use appropriate early interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053451212454003">Skiba et al., 2011</xref>). This is more easily done when the educators understand the language-learning process.</p>
<p>While learning English, students will typically progress through the following stages: (a) preproduction, (b) early production, (c) speech emergence, (d) intermediate fluency, and (e) advanced fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212454003">Krashen, 1987</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212454003">Table 1</xref>). This process may take from 4 to 11 years, depending on many factors such as proficiency in primary language, level of instruction, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212454003">V. P. Collier, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212454003">Cummins, 1981</xref>). Few studies have been completed on implementing behavior strategies specifically with students who are learning English. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212454003">Goldenberg (2008)</xref> found that effective instruction strategies generally hold true for students learning English. Therefore, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212454003">Table 1</xref> shows alignment between the stages of language development and language/behavior research-based strategies, which can easily be implemented in the classroom.</p>

<p>The process of learning an additional language not only involves learning grammar and pragmatic rules but also mastering cultural and social norms. Learning a new language and, in some cases, a new culture can be a stressful event for children. When teachers view learning English as a deficit, rather than valuing bilingualism, there may be a negative impact on a student’s sense of self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053451212454003">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>), which can produce higher feelings of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454003">Dawson &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053451212454003">Pappamihiel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053451212454003">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>). Some children will express this stress in ways that may impede their learning. For example, students with low self-worth and high anxiety may be less likely to interact with other children. Because the use of language is vital to acquiring language, this type of social interaction with peers is the most important way to learn a new language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212454003">Krashen, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Teachers need to understand that a student’s difficulty in using and understanding language may impact his or her behavior at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1053451212454003">Ochoa et al., 1999</xref>). A strong body of research has demonstrated the correlation between language delays and subsequent behavioral/emotional problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212454003">Fontenot, Hayes, &amp; Frilot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451212454003">Hart, Fujiki, Brinton, &amp; Hart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451212454003">Linares-Orama, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1053451212454003">Tomblin, Zhang, &amp; Buckwalter, 2000</xref>). Therefore, whereas many English learners will not exhibit any behavior difficulties, others may exhibit behaviors that have a negative impact on learning. These behaviors can include verbal and physical aggression, impulsiveness, defensiveness, withdrawal, disorganization, timidity, fear, anxiety, low self-esteem, and an inability to understand and follow directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212454003">C. Collier &amp; Hoover, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454003">Dawson &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>). If a student experiences behaviors that affect learning while also in the process of acquiring English, teachers must consider language acquisition as a factor. Educators who understand language proficiency levels can better identify strategies for use with behavior difficulties (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212454003">Table 1</xref>). For example, if a student is in the preproduction stage of language acquisition, the teacher may need to use nonverbal redirection strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212454003">Alberto &amp; Troutman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212454003">Krashen, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053451212454003">Zirpoli, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Some of the educational impacts of learning English are not within the child’s control. Teachers have been found to rate English learners less favorably than White or English-proficient Latino students in a variety of domains (e.g., academic, social, and behavioral; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454003">Dowdy, Dever, DiStefano, &amp; Chin, 2011</xref>). Some additional challenges that learning English may present are difficulty accessing the curriculum and difficulty understanding directions. These challenges may contribute to the teacher’s holding an unfavorable opinion about the student. When students are experiencing stressors and are not finding school a safe place, it becomes challenging for them to handle the pressure they may be experiencing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454003">Dawson and Williams (2008)</xref> found higher rates of externalizing behaviors in students with lower English proficiency. These researchers concluded that children who had difficulty managing their frustration might exhibit their feelings through externalizing behaviors (e.g., hitting, yelling, kicking) or internalizing problems (e.g., withdrawal, depression). This may be especially true for learners with disabilities that affect their ability to learn English. These findings corroborate what is known about students who are having academic difficulty.</p>

<sec id="section2-1053451212454003">
<title>Ensuring Validity of Functional Behavioral Assessment</title>
<p>Even with the best classroom management plan, some students may require more individualized behavior plans. These are developed through careful observation and identification of the behavior’s purpose and use of appropriate strategies to modify it. The functional behavioral analysis (FBA) provides a context from which teams can design and plan intervention strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454003">Crone &amp; Horner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053451212454003">Killu, 2008</xref>). When a teacher is developing a behavior intervention plan for a learner with behavior difficulties, several additional factors need to be considered. These considerations are required in the initial FBA process as well as the development of the behavior plan.</p>
<p>Current legislation requires that students with disabilities who present behaviors that impede their learning or the learning of others, must have a behavioral intervention plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212454003">Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act, 2004</xref>). An effective behavior plan, developed through use of a culturally and linguistically responsive FBA, leads to the implementation of academic and behavioral strategies that best fit the unique characteristics of a student. This requires teachers to first identify and document a clear relationship between the learning and cultural characteristics of a student and the behavior(s) in question. Important considerations such as a student’s primary language, stage of second language acquisition, student characteristics, and data from language assessments need to be taken into account when a relationship is determined between students’ language learning and target behaviors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1053451212454003">Figure 1</xref>). These data will allow the educator conducting the FBA necessary information regarding variables impacting behavior in the classroom.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1053451212454003" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>

<p>Sample behavior plan for English language learner (ELL) students.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1053451212454003-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>In the development of a behavior plan, an analysis of the environment/instructional context must be conducted first. Prior to observation of the behavior for the FBA, data concerning the student’s level of language proficiency must be available. To assess the student’s level of language competence, the team should conduct assessments. Suggested assessments are the <italic>Language Assessment Scales</italic> (<italic>LAS</italic>), <italic>Idea Proficiency Test</italic> (<italic>IPT</italic>), <italic>Woodcock-Muñoz</italic>, language samples, and running records. This is necessary for a valid determination of the function of the student’s behavior. Typically, during the FBA process behavior screenings are also completed.</p>
<p>There is very little research on how language proficiency impacts the behavior screening process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454003">Dowdy et al., 2011</xref>). The validity of teacher-rated behavior scales with CLD students is uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212454003">Epstein et al., 2005</xref>). This means that the team needs to understand that any scores derived through standardized behavior screens must be interpreted carefully, particularly if English learners were not included in the norm sample of the assessment. While conducting the FBA, teams must not only consider data related to the behaviors, the antecedents, and the consequences but also to the cultural and language factors. Teams must determine whether the student is experiencing any stresses due to learning English. This can be done through structured interviews with the student, parent(s), and other stakeholders. Additional data that the team must consider in the data collection process are the primary language of the child and the current stage of language acquisition of the child (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1053451212454003">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212454003">Krashen, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Student characteristics to be included in the data collection process include (a) amount of time in the country (do not assume that the child was born in another country; the majority of English learners are born in the United States), (b) level of acculturation, and (c) cultural background. This information then becomes part of the behavior plan (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1053451212454003">Figure 1</xref>). Assessing these cultural factors will give the team needed information of any impact on the student’s behavior. There can be psychological responses to becoming acculturated that can be confused as indicators of a disability. These include heightened anxiety, poor self-image, withdrawal, and confused locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454003">C. Collier, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Though these characteristics are difficult to measure, one assessment is available. The <italic>Acculturation Quick Screen–III</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454003">C. Collier, 2001</xref>) provides the level and rate of a students’ acculturation to public school culture. Too often this information is discussed among the FBA development team but not shared with the people who will be implementing the behavior plan. Establishing a clear connection between the FBA and the behavior intervention process is critical to the development of appropriate behavior plans to increase student academic and social achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454003">Crone &amp; Horner, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Strategies for Effective Behavior Intervention Plans</title>
<p>Behavior intervention plans must contain and refer to data collected throughout the FBA. Because behavior plans are used and implemented across the entire school setting, the format and components must be explicit to ensure proper implementation by all stakeholders. The student characteristics, description of the target behaviors, measureable objectives, behavior change strategies, and generalization/maintenance goals must specifically consider not only the behavior but language considerations as well (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1053451212454003">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Through the FBA, language proficiency should be identified, which will allow intervention teams to determine the most appropriate language (i.e., English or primary language) to use during the implementation of behavior change strategies. Typically, a behavior plan will contain a summary of the assessment results, so it is imperative that the language assessment results be included as well. Furthermore, best practice suggests cultural characteristics be listed in the plan to improve generalization and maintenance of any newly learned skills. These characteristics can include level of acculturation, student’s cultural background norms, and personality type. When behaviors taught in school do not conflict with a student’s home culture, generalization of newly learned skills is likely to be increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451212454003">Gay, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Specific strategy implementation procedures with generalization and maintenance guidelines must take into account culturally responsive techniques. A student’s cultural norms must be considered when selecting behavior change approaches. Careful attention must be given to ensure that the rules or steps incorporated into a strategy do not conflict with a student’s background (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212454003">Table 1</xref>). The change strategies must be culturally and socially relevant to ensure student success. For example, students should not be required to make eye contact if that behavior conflicts with their cultural norms.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Prevention Is an Even Better Option</title>
<p>Understanding how to develop an appropriate behavior plan is important for teachers. However, it is imperative educators also take preventative measures to reduce the need for linguistically appropriate behavior plans. Schools need to adopt preventative and early interventions to assist English learners in dealing with stress. Some preventative strategies include effective classroom management, teacher training, and school support systems.</p>
<p>Typically, when designing a classroom management plan, educators are encouraged to consider several components. Classroom expectations regarding rules and procedures should be developed through student input and be clearly stated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212454003">Alberto &amp; Troutman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053451212454003">Zirpoli, 2008</xref>). In delivering reinforcers and consequences, educators must consider the present behavioral and learning needs of the students, along with the implications of the students’ background culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454003">Crone &amp; Horner, 2003</xref>). As with any management system, the modeling of expectations is essential. For effective classroom management, it is crucial the teachers model cross-cultural competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212454003">Gay, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451212454003">2010</xref>). <italic>Cross-cultural competency</italic> is one’s ability to work effectively with members of differing cultural and linguistic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053451212454003">Lynch &amp; Hanson, 2011</xref>). To model this skill, teachers must realize and accept the changing demographics of the schools, be willing to support student social and academic growth, and be competent and willing to develop an appropriate and culturally responsive management system.</p>
<p>Professional development opportunities can provide teachers access to training and practice necessary to develop cultural responsive classroom management systems. Training topics should focus on second language acquisitions, unique needs of English learners in the local district, and stressors that acculturation and language learning may have on students. Educators are also encouraged to develop opportunities for discussion with and among English learners. These discussions will shed light on the particular needs of students and facilitate the further development and implementation of additional supports.</p>
<p>English learners will benefit from schoolwide supports in the areas of social, adaptive, and study skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454003">Dowdy et al., 2011</xref>). To meet the needs of all students, school teams should understand their students. Teachers must consider the impact that learning English may have on students. It is clear that language and behavior are closely intertwined and have an influence on the student’s academic and social outcomes. By understanding this relationship, educators can ensure that planning for problem behaviors is done appropriately. With the rapidly growing number of English learners in U.S. schools, it is imperative that more effective ways are developed to understand and responds to these students’ needs.</p>
