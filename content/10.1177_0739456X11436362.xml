<p>This is a timely and potentially significant book that goes a long way toward bringing up to date the literature on community organizing and community development. <italic>Contesting Community</italic> sets out to illuminate the growing conundrum of community organizing: (1) that communities are important as sites of global capital, as the opportunity structures for everyday life, and as loci for political contestation and (2) that community action is shaped and severely constrained by global, national, and historical forces. Much of the community development literature seems stuck in eras and tales of valor that have passed. This book will be appreciated by instructors of graduate and undergraduate courses in community development who tire of their students shrugging off such works as stories from “back in the day.” It also counters the alternative response that the market, together with acts of charity, comprise the only imaginable forms of community development.</p>
<p>The first chapter titled “Community and Its Discontents” outlines the ways in which communities work as sites of social reproduction of labor and of the political economy. Drawing heavily on earlier works by the authors, they describe the contestation of community within itself by people with different objective interests and by community actors as they face the forces of the nation-state and the global political economy. They announce one of the main themes of the book, the paradox that the provision of many necessities of life are thrown back on communities as a result of devolution, neoliberal policies, and the globalization of the economy, leaving communities inherently weak in their abilities to affect or control these larger forces. Thus, communities have great difficulty delivering the goods. Other major themes such as disdain for the romantic idea of community and their belief in the value of conflict in community organizing are also announced. The chapter introduces a framework for understanding community development and community organizing in the neoliberal era. Despite portraying communities as politically marginal, they assert that communities are nonetheless places for organizing for power. Later chapters develop this vision and provide useful brief case studies of instances in which they believe that effective organizing does happen.</p>
<p>The second chapter, “History Matters,” updates Fischer’s previous writing about the history of community organizing. The central thesis of the chapter is that the progressive and conservative political eras inevitably define the nature of community organizing. Only during periods of national progressive mobilization do the authors see progressive community organizing as genuinely flourishing. The chapter does a useful service by detailing the conservative deployment of community organizing in the past century and a half. It also provides a helpful brief history of progressive community organizing, though giving too little attention to the black power and women’s movements. The tendency in the chapter to equate progressive action with a preference of powerful centrist states seems to overlook the potential for authoritarianism inherent in this arrangement. Progressive organizing in different periods has often in fact been mobilized against the power of centrist state policies. This limitation foreshadows a recurrent problem of the lack of an explicit position on democratic theory and practice.</p>
<p>The third chapter on the market, the state, and community lays out core theoretical arguments and also reveals the contradictions that the authors sometimes fall into. They correctly note the problematic nature of relying on market forces to correct the market failures that make community development necessary in the first place. The authors usefully explicate and critique the concepts of social enterprise and the social economy. They also give a good account of decentralization and devolution in the past thirty or so years in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. But in making both arguments, it becomes unclear as to who or what is steering community processes. Initially it appears that neoliberal global capitalism makes the state an insignificant player or at best a foreman pressing the will of capital on the workers but without real power itself. Yet the state is described as “steering from afar” (p. 91). Much of the discussion labeled “community as social policy” (p. 83) discusses the constraints imposed in the era of devolution on community organizations as they contract with government to provide services to community members. While these accounts are dead-on accurate with regard to how community organizations respond to the constraints they are under, the idea that “progressive” community organizing would promote a strong centrist state gets a bit lost. Yes, the state is portrayed as shirking its responsibilities. But the background of the rapid global circulation of capital seems to be ignored.</p>
<p>The next chapter “It Takes a Village” disputes the idea that local assets and local organizing can solve the problems of inequity and social injustice experienced in marginalized communities or by marginalized members of other communities. Effective community strategies must instead situate local organizing in the context of building strong national associations and movements. The authors pose again a conflict-oriented oppositional model against one built on community assets and networks. They nod to but do not really address here the need to provide necessities of life for those disadvantaged in the market and ignored by the state. They do not make clear a strategy for balancing these demands. They refer approvingly to theorists such as Hillary Wainwright, Archon Fung, and Eric Olin Wright, but the explication of these theories is vague, requiring preexisting familiarity with these works. The authors continue to call for opposition but do not clarify what is to be opposed, or how to make it effective.</p>
<p>One of the strongest contributions of the book occurs later in Chapter 4 when the authors analyze the successes of community organizing by the Christian Right. This analysis begins to establish the necessarily ideological nature of what they see as successful community organizing and the ways in which local organizing should link to the national level. Quoting Hardisty, they also note, “The contemporary right is a well-financed and well-run movement that combines shrewd strategic planning for political success with a rigid set of ideological principles, backed by certitude and based in implicit and explicit religious beliefs” (p. 132). Recalling the earlier assertions that the political climate of an era dictates the nature of successful community organizing, one does wonder whether these lessons can be transferred to progressive political organizing around a different vision of social justice.</p>
<p>The next two chapters attempt to answer this concern. Chapter 5 lays out three case studies of progressive organizing around calls for social justice and non–market-driven solutions to problems of economic and political marginalization. The authors describe frankly and interestingly the tensions inherent in a social justice thrust arising from the need for concrete accomplishments while maintaining opposition to the existing economic and political arrangements. This chapter will be most popular with teachers and students of community development because they make concrete many of the earlier analytic claims. The analysis of these cases includes a call to move away from dualistic thinking about community organizing and community development. I agree with this call but find that the book itself often seems to reify rather than go beyond that opposition, a tendency that reemerges in the final chapter.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 summarizes the principles that the book develops for “Radicalizing Community.” These principles include (1) understanding the importance of community by understanding it in its larger context, (2) emphasizing conflict and power, (3) uniting community and social movement efforts, (4) making critical analysis and political education important to the practice of organizing—concluding with a final exhortation to “make history.” The text accompanying each principle makes a lot of sense. However, it often does not resolve the problems related to applying the principle. For example, in discussing the need to emphasize conflict and power, the authors note the importance of alternative practices and cite Raymond Williams. I wanted to understand this better in the context of this particular text, not by tracking down another one. As a reader I still was left ambivalent about what exactly to do and the possibility of following these principles in practice. Yet the book provides a much needed and often helpful addition to the existing literature on community organizing and community development. I find myself referring to it frequently in my classes on community development because the ambiguities one is left with seem real.</p>
