<p>Musculoskeletal complaints, pain, and weakness are common among children post–hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Bone abnormalities include decreased bone mineral density and avascular necrosis, both affecting ambulation and quality of life for survivors. Several risk factors for both disorders among adults have been described along with suggested interventions. However, similar recommendations for screening and management of bone abnormalities among children and adolescents post-HSCT are not clearly defined. A review of the literature using PubMed, CINAHL, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Cochrane Collection databases identified a paucity of reports specific to the management of bone abnormalities in children and adolescents post-HSCT. Although guidelines for evaluation of bone health in pediatric patients with cancer exist, none specifically address early screening and prevention. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the literature on current evidence for age appropriate screening, prevention, and management of bone abnormalities in children post-HSCT and to present a clinical guideline for bone abnormalities in children post-HSCT used in a hospital-based outpatient center.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As enhanced, risk-adapted treatment regimens have improved survival and decreased morbidity in pediatric cancer, cancer survivorship has become a growing specialty. Approximately, 80% of pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients surviving at least 2 years posttransplant are expected to become long-term survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043454212473653">Bhatia, 2011</xref>). Focus on health care outcomes then shifts to decreasing late morbidity by detecting side effects of transplant treatment, and intervening, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The 2005 Institute of Medicine report on the status of health care defined cancer survivorship as a distinct phase in the cancer care continuum that begins when the highest risk of disease recurrence has passed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043454212473653">Patterson, 2010</xref>). The plan of care should ideally be derived from an evidence-based clinical practice guideline. However, current guidelines are often made up of expert opinion and consensus that lead to conflicting/inconsistent recommendations that can be confusing to health care providers. The frequency and type of surveillance required should be patient specific, based on risks and benefits, making it difficult to write generic guidelines. Further complicating the issue for pediatric survivors, specialists familiar with problems of childhood cancer survivors are limited, particularly within a nonacademic health care facility. This has resulted in a need for oncology and transplant providers to become proficient in the management of common sequelae of treatment, such as bone abnormalities.</p>
<p>HSCT is increasingly performed for malignant and nonmalignant disorders in children. Survival has improved over the past 20 years, but a large number of recipients suffer from long-term morbidity, resulting in the need for comprehensive survivorship follow-up. Musculoskeletal complaints are common in these patients because of their underlying disease and side effects of treatments given before and during the transplant period. The source of pain and weakness is often secondary to bone abnormalities, the most common of which include decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and avascular necrosis (AVN), both affecting ambulation and quality of life. Several risk factors for both disorders as well as suggested interventions have been described. However, risk- and age-based recommendations for screening and management of bone abnormalities among children post-HSCT are not clearly defined.</p>
<p>Hormones are essential for homeostasis of the skeletal system and are often affected by HSCT leading to the development of bone abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043454212473653">Dvorak et al., 2011</xref>). The risk of endocrine complications depends on pre-transplant treatment, transplant preparative therapy, and posttransplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Decreased BMD (osteopenia and osteoporosis) may occur secondary to use of corticosteroids, growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, physical inactivity, and poor diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043454212473653">Bhatia, 2011</xref>). The pathogenesis of AVN remains controversial and is likely the result of multiple triggers. Local vascular damage with temporary ischemia to the bone, increased intraosseous pressure, and mechanical stress can all lead to demineralization, necrosis, and then collapse of trabecular bone. This process is progressive, resulting in destruction within 3 to 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043454212473653">Tauchmanova et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Clinical guidelines for the management of long-term complications of cancer treatment have recently been developed for adult and pediatric survivors; however, guidelines specifically for HSCT recipients are lacking. The Children’s Oncology Group has incorporated transplant survivors within their long-term follow-up guidelines. However, the recommendations do not begin until 2 years after completion of therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043454212473653">National Guideline Clearinghouse, 2008</xref>). The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a review of the literature on current evidence for age appropriate screening, prevention, and management of bone abnormalities in children post-HSCT and to present a clinical guideline for bone abnormalities in children post-HSCT used in a hospital-based outpatient center.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was conducted in December 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043454212473653">PRISMA, 2012</xref>). Search updates were performed biweekly through March 2012. Databases accessed were PubMed, CINAHL, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Cochrane Collection. Search terms included bone marrow transplant, survivor, children, osteopenia, AVN, and bone disease. Boolean and MeSH terms were used. Abstracts were reviewed and articles selected if they contained key concepts of interest to the clinical question. This produced 92 records of potential interest. An additional 5 articles were provided from clinical experts. Fourteen articles were noted to be duplicates, and subsequently removed. Eighty-three articles were left for review; of these, 45 met eligibility for consideration in development of the clinical guideline that included discussions of BMD changes or AVN in children, and treatments for both. Articles were excluded if they did not include the age-group of interest (recipients of HSCT, 1-21 years old), were not in English, or were published prior to 1998; since HSCT strategies have significantly changed in the past 15 years. Eligible articles were then categorized by theme and rated for level of evidence and quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043454212473653">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Bone Mineral Density Changes</title>
<p>In healthy individuals, peak bone mass is achieved by the second or third decades of life, followed by progressive bone loss throughout adulthood. Low BMD is likely to occur in HSCT patients who do not reach BMD goals during childhood secondary to disruption of bone metabolism caused by the underlying disease and/or treatment. This predisposes these survivors to osteoporotic fractures later in life. Few studies have been reported exclusively in pediatric cancer patients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043454212473653">Klopfenstein et al. (2009)</xref> found a 48% baseline prevalence of low BMD in children with acute leukemia and 67% in patients with aplastic anemia prior to HSCT. Five years following HSCT, an additional 26% of children have osteopenia and 21% have osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043454212473653">Klopfenstein et al., 2009</xref>). Loss in bone density occurs most significantly during the first 6 months post-HSCT and usually returns to the patient’s baseline density within 48 months post-HSCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043454212473653">Bhatia, 2011</xref>). Nontraumatic fractures were seen in approximately 10% of patients within 3 years of their HSCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043454212473653">Bhatia, 2011</xref>). It is unknown how these bone problems affect survivors into adulthood; however, it is speculated to increase the risk of adult osteoporosis, which can negatively affect mobility and quality of life.</p>
<sec id="section5-1043454212473653">
<title>Pathophysiology of bone loss post-HSCT</title>
<p>Loss of bone mineral in children post-HSCT is a result of decreased bone formation and resorption, secondary to tissue injury caused by treatment given before, during, and after transplant, as well as their direct effects on the bone marrow stromal cell compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043454212473653">McClune et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043454212473653">Stein, Ebeling, &amp; Shane, 2007</xref>). Osteoporosis occurs when low-bone mass leads to micro-architectural collapse and destruction of bone tissue, resulting in fragile bones and risk of fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043454212473653">Shaw, 2008</xref>). In children, osteoporosis is not defined solely on measurements of BMD but also considers bone fracture history. Secondary osteoporosis in children with chronic illness arises from one or more etiologic factors, including reduced mobility, inflammatory cytokine release, systemic corticosteroid administration, delayed puberty, and emaciation/malnutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043454212473653">Shaw, 2008</xref>). Mechanical loading is essential for maintenance of strength and growth of bone; therefore, children and adolescents unable to participate in frequent physical activity due to their debilitation are likely to develop BMD loss. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor are often elaborated in children post-HSCT and suppress osteoblast recruitment and stimulate osteoclastogenesis leading to an imbalance in bone turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043454212473653">Shaw, 2008</xref>). Imbalance of bone turnover results in muscle wasting, which further compromises the need for mechanical loading of the bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043454212473653">Shaw, 2008</xref>). A similar mechanism occurs with prolonged corticosteroid usage. Reduced intestinal absorption and increased renal tubular excretion of calcium, both side effects of corticosteroids, further complicate BMD loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043454212473653">Shaw, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine, are commonly used post-HSCT to prevent GVHD. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients commonly receive calcineurin inhibitors as part of their GVHD prophylaxis regimen for an average of 6 months posttransplant. These agents are thought to interfere with osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation, and may also directly inhibit bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043454212473653">Shaw, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To maintain skeletal homeostasis, calcium and vitamin D are essential. Vitamin D deficiency may precipitate or exacerbate osteopenia and osteoporosis, and may lead to decreased calcium absorption; hypocalcemia causes a rise in parathyroid hormone leading to increased bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043454212473653">Sproat et al., 2011</xref>). Vitamin D is obtained from exposure to sunlight, food, or dietary supplements, and insufficient amounts of any of these sources can lead to deficiency. Decreased synthesis of vitamin D may be caused by liver or kidney insufficiency, anticonvulsants, and corticosteroids, all of which may be present in children post-HSCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043454212473653">Sproat et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, children with antecedent chronic illness have decreased exposure to outside activities (sunlight) and are counseled to use sunscreen due to increased photosensitivity. Anorexia and gastrointestinal mucosal injury from prior chemotherapy and post-HSCT gastrointestinal GVHD will further limit absorption of vitamin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043454212473653">Sproat et al., 2011</xref>). In a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043454212473653">Sproat et al. (2011)</xref>, 89.7% of adult HSCT recipients had low levels of vitamin D. Most had GVHD and were taking corticosteroids, and were not on vitamin D supplements. More than half of these patients were found to have a low BMD score and low parathyroid hormone level.</p>

<title>Diagnosis of bone loss</title>
<p>BMD is most often measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and is the standard study for pediatric patients. It reports scores as grams of mineral per square centimeter and then standardizes the results against normal population means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043454212473653">McClune et al., 2011</xref>). DEXA obtains measures in 2 dimensions and then calculates volumetric measures, as compared with quantitative computed tomography, which determines volumetric BMD in 3 dimensions but is associated with higher doses of ionizing radiation. Expression of scores differs by patient age and gender, and is expressed in either a <italic>T</italic>-score for postmenopausal women and men 50 years or older, or <italic>Z</italic>-score for children, adolescents, and young adults younger than 50 years old. The site for BMD measurement is different between pediatric and older adult patients. The accepted site for pediatric and young adult patients is the total body less the head and lumbar spine, whereas adult measurements are obtained from the femoral neck, total hip, and spine, and at least 2 vertebral bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454212473653">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>). For pediatric and young adult survivors of HSCT, <italic>Z</italic>-scores are the preferred method of reporting BMD changes but might under estimate bone loss since many of these patients are small for age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043454212473653">Ruble, Hayat, Stewart, &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>). A study among pediatric HSCT survivors at John Hopkins’s suggest that DEXA volumetric calculation of lumbar BMD is a reliable method for detecting bone mineral loss in survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043454212473653">Ruble et al., 2010</xref>). Reduced BMD in children is defined as a <italic>Z</italic>-score less than or equal to −2.0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043454212473653">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043454212473653">McClune et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Vitamin D deficiency is known to adversely affect BMD, particularly in children; however, the optimal vitamin D level to define deficiency among children recovering from HSCT is not known. Several studies have shown an unfavorable effect of low 25-OH-D levels on bone health even among healthy children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043454212473653">Wagner &amp; Greer, 2008</xref>). Assessment of vitamin D in children with cancer is not routinely performed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children with increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, such as those with darker skin pigment, decreased sunlight exposure, or chronic disease with associated fat malabsorption, be monitored with serum 25-OH-D and parathyroid hormone levels, as well as bone mineral status by DEXA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043454212473653">Wagner &amp; Greer, 2008</xref>). If a deficiency is identified a supplement should be prescribed and 25-OH-D levels should be repeated at 3-month intervals until a normal value is achieved. Parathyroid hormone and bone mineral status should be repeated at 6-month intervals until normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043454212473653">Wagner &amp; Greer, 2008</xref>). Children post-HSCT lack sun exposure for weeks while hospitalized, and those with GVHD of the gut will likely have malabsorption, placing these children at risk for vitamin D deficiency. The utility of parathyroid hormone monitoring in the post-HSCT setting is unknown and not routinely recommended in the evaluation of secondary bone loss.</p>
<p>Consensus guidelines from bone marrow transplant professional organizations recommend screening with DEXA 1 year following HSCT in adults but there is no guidance for pediatric recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043454212473653">Majhail et al., 2012</xref>). The Children’s Oncology Group Survivor Guidelines recommend bone density screening 2 years after completion of cancer therapy, but do not take into account specific risks for HSCT patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043454212473653">National Guideline Clearinghouse, 2008</xref>). The official statement of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry states that a baseline DEXA should be obtained for anyone with a history of childhood cancer or prior to HSCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454212473653">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, patients with thalassemia major should have a DEXA scan at 10 years of age or fracture presentation, whichever is earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454212473653">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>). Therapeutic intervention should not be started on the basis of one DEXA measurement alone, but if bone-active treatment is begun, follow-up studies should be obtained no more often than 6 month intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454212473653">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to these limitations, many large transplant centers are creating their own comprehensive guidelines for BMD monitoring. Current research suggests baseline DEXA evaluation prior to undergoing HSCT with early screening and treatment intervention following HSCT, especially for children with malignant diseases, and has recently been recommended as a practice change by a panel of international experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043454212473653">Pulsipher et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-1043454212473653">
<title>Risk factors</title>
<p>Multiple risk factors for bone loss have been described among HSCT survivors including: younger age at diagnosis, cumulative dose and duration of corticosteroids or calcineuron inhibitors, chronic GVHD, cranial radiation or total body irradiation, growth hormone deficiency, thyroid dysfunction, and gonadal dysfunction associated estrogen or testosterone deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043454212473653">Bhatia, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043454212473653">Majhail et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043454212473653">National Guideline Clearinghouse, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043454212473653">Pulsipher et al., 2012</xref>). The most significant risk factors are being an older child or adolescent at time of treatment and prolonged use of corticosteroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043454212473653">National Guideline Clearinghouse, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043454212473653">Ruble et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043454212473653">Table 2</xref>). Rapid bone loss can occur during the first 6 months of corticosteroid and with a dose equal to or greater than 5 mg prednisone equivalent daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043454212473653">Carpenter et al., 2007</xref>). Several studies have shown a positive correlation between BMD loss and corticosteroid use specifically in children; however, a minimum exposure of corticosteroid dose per body surface area in children has not been reported and the duration of exposure as well as cumulative doses &gt;9000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> may be significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043454212473653">Dahllof, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454212473653">Faraci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043454212473653">Petryk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043454212473653">Wasilewski-Masker et al., 2008</xref>).

<p>Patients with osteoporosis or a history of multiple bone fractures should be referred to endocrinology for consideration of pharmacologic interventions, such as bisphosphonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043454212473653">National Guideline Clearinghouse, 2007</xref>). Bisphosphonate treatment is often used in the management of bone loss in adults post-HSCT; however, efficacy in children has not been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043454212473653">Carpenter et al., 2007</xref>). Bisphosphonates act through effecting enzymatic pathways, which inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts, and also by stimulating osteoblasts to promote bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043454212473653">Carpenter et al., 2007</xref>). They have been historically used in children with primary osteoporosis; experience among children with secondary osteoporosis or as prevention in children at high risk for BMD loss is limited. A Cochrane review of bisphosphonate therapy for children and adolescents with secondary osteoporosis showed that bisphosphonates may not lead to improvement in BMD, and further use of bisphosphonates in this population should only be within the context of a clinical trial (Ward et al., 2007).</p>
<p>Patients with thalassemia, some of whom are candidates for HSCT, have experienced increased bone mass with bisphosphonate and/or sex hormone therapy; however, prospective clinical trials need to be conducted before endorsing this as a standard pre-HSCT treatment recommendation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454212473653">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>). No standard guidelines for prevention or treatment of pediatric bone disease following HSCT are available at this time because of lack of published data.</p>

<title>Avascular Necrosis</title>
<p>AVN develops when blood supply to the bone is interrupted. It is a known complication of childhood leukemia treatment and HSCT, causing pain and significantly decreased quality of life. Treatment often involves surgery. Joint replacement surgery is required to restore function and relieve pain in approximately 50% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212473653">McAvoy et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The incidence of AVN occurring after an unrelated donor HSCT is approximately 15% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043454212473653">Dvorak et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212473653">McAvoy et al. (2010)</xref> detected a 3% cumulative incidence of AVN at 5 years post-HSCT, among allogeneic and autologous recipients using routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043454212473653">Kaste et al. (2004)</xref> reported a 44% incidence among pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients. Presenting symptoms include vague bone pain and decreased mobility. After subchondral collapse and articular deformity occurs, pain is often severe, occurring even at rest and resulting in severe physical limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043454212473653">Kadan-Lottick et al., 2008</xref>). The proximal and distal femurs are the most common sites of involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212473653">McAvoy et al., 2010</xref>). The majority of children will have involvement at 2 or more sites. Most cases are identified within 3 years post-HSCT, some as early as 1 to 6 months after initiation of corticosteroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212473653">McAvoy et al., 2010</xref>). The median time for development of AVN in Dvorak et al.’s study (2011) was 11 months post-HSCT.</p>
<sec id="section10-1043454212473653">
<title>Pathophysiology of AVN post-HSCT</title>
<p>In HSCT recipients, AVN occurs from disruption of blood supply to the bone secondary to tissue damage caused by medications, radiation, and GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212473653">McAvoy et al., 2010</xref>). Development of AVN post-HSCT may also be affected by a deficit in bone marrow stromal cell regeneration and low osteoblast numbers. Radiation causes a reduction in osteoblasts as well as fibrosis and thickening of small vessels resulting in tissue ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454212473653">Faraci et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, research has indicated that BMD changes do not seem to be related to the development of AVN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043454212473653">Stein et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1043454212473653">
<title>Diagnosis of avascular necrosis</title>
<p>A high index of suspicion and focused screening among HSCT recipients is essential for early detection of AVN. Historically, clinicians used conventional radiography as the tool of choice for diagnosis, and obtained MRI for staging purposes. Further studies revealed lesions on MRI that might not be detected on plain films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043454212473653">Wiesmann et al., 1998</xref>). MRI also distinguishes AVN from bone marrow edema improving specificity and sensitivity as compared with other diagnostic modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043454212473653">Wiesmann et al., 1998</xref>). Clinicians now use MRI as the technique of choice for diagnosis of AVN, recognizing that early detection and treatment may delay progression and decrease morbidity for patients.</p>

<sec id="section12-1043454212473653">
<title>Risk factors</title>
<p>Major risk factors for development of AVN include older pediatric age (median 14.4 years), males, presence of chronic GVHD, and treatment with calcineurin inhibitors or corticosteroids. The cumulative dose and duration of corticosteroids seems to be important (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043454212473653">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043454212473653">Campbell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212473653">McAvoy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043454212473653">Tauchmanova et al., 2003</xref>). Among survivors of childhood cancer with AVN 60% had more than one bone affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043454212473653">Kadan-Lottick et al., 2008</xref>). These patients were more likely to be older at time of their cancer diagnosis, with a history of exposure to both chemotherapy and radiation, and HSCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043454212473653">Kadan-Lottick et al., 2008</xref>). The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study identified alkylating agents, methotrexate, dexamethasone, and radiation to the gonads as additional risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043454212473653">Kadan-Lottick et al., 2008</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212473653">McAvoy et al.’s (2010)</xref> study, the only independent risk factors for development of AVN were corticosteroid exposure and allogeneic HSCT. With regard to corticosteroid exposure, both cumulative dose and duration of exposure were important, with the highest incidence of AVN occurring in patients receiving a prednisone equivalent dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day for 1 year or more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212473653">McAvoy et al., 2010</xref>). The use of total body irradiation (TBI) as part of the transplant conditioning regimen, history of a prior HSCT, and underlying cancer diagnosis did not increase the risk of developing AVN in this cohort of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212473653">McAvoy et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454212473653">Jagasia, Misfeldt, and Griffith (2010)</xref> report unrelated donor source, TBI, and corticosteroids &gt;1 mg/kg/day as independent predictors of AVN. An Italian case–control study in children post–allogeneic HSCT identified older age (transplanted at 13 vs 8 years), radiation therapy in conditioning (higher incidence with TBI in 3 fractions vs 6), and extensive chronic GVHD as significant risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454212473653">Faraci et al., 2006</xref>). They did find an association between AVN and corticosteroid exposure; however, the effect disappeared in multivariate analysis. The authors postulated that the primary source of AVN is vascular damage from a synergetic effect between TBI and chronic GVHD since radiation is known to reduce the number of osteoblasts and cause microvascular changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454212473653">Faraci et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

This has been noted previously among female adolescents diagnosed with hematologic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043454212473653">Bhatia, 2011</xref>). However, other groups have found the opposite with increased incidence seen in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043454212473653">Campbell et al., 2009</xref>). Schulte and colleagues did find a relationship between AVN and cancer diagnosis in which acute leukemia patients are more likely than chronic leukemia patients, and lymphoid more likely than myeloid malignancies, to develop AVN. However this may be related to differences in corticosteroid doses used for treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043454212473653">Schulte &amp; Beelen, 2004</xref>).

<title>Interventions</title>
<p>Consensus has not been reached in regard to the timing of optimal screening and treatment of early stage AVN. MRI is the most sensitive screening modality; however, cost and effectiveness remains an obstacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043454212473653">Dvorak et al., 2011</xref>). Currently, there are no standard pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of AVN in children. Some case reports describe improvement in pain and mobility with bisphosphonates among childhood cancer survivors with AVN; however, long-term potential effects from bisphosphonate use during the active phase of bone growth is not known, and therefore it is not routinely recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043454212473653">Greggio et al., 2010</xref>). Recent research suggests a role for statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering agents, in the prevention of steroid-induced AVN; however, studies in children are limited and this is not recommended outside of a clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043454212473653">Sheen et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the orthopedic community there is controversy to the timing of surgical interventions, particularly in younger children and in patients with chronic GVHD. Often more than one joint is involved and patients are immunosuppressed, increasing the potential sequelae from total joint replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043454212473653">Zadegan, Raould, Bizot, Nizard, &amp; Sedel, 2008</xref>). Although the HSCT survivor may not be an optimal candidate for surgery, most agree that once AVN has led to subchondral fracture and collapse, total joint replacement is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043454212473653">Schulte &amp; Beelen, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Developing evidence-based guidelines for a very specific population of patients is challenging. Currently, about 1500 HSCTs are performed annually in patients younger than 21 years, and about 60% of these patients survive past 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043454212473653">Pasquini &amp; Wang, 2011</xref>). This yields a small number of patients in which to extrapolate data, and can be a big obstacle for conducting randomized trials. Alternatively, clinicians can decide to apply guidelines developed for adults to the pediatric population, or accept evidence from small case–control or cohort studies, descriptive and qualitative studies, and expert committee opinions. In light of this, feasibility, and risk–benefit ratio, is often considered prior to adopting a specific recommendation within the subspecialty of pediatric HSCT. For example, no randomized studies show improvement of BMD among children post-HSCT following vitamin D replacement; however the low cost, ease of administration, and favorable toxicity profile make this a reasonable option to consider. Recent press regarding the immune modulating affects of vitamin D enhances its attractiveness among pediatric HSCT recipients.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043454212473653">Carpenter et al. (2007)</xref> reported a 33% improvement in BMD among pediatric HSCT recipients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, but the number of patients were low (n = 18) and the majority of patients were receiving treatment for chronic GVHD, representing the highest risk population. Monthly infusions of pamidronate (Aredia) over 2 to 3 hours were well tolerated; however, they required an increased time commitment and carry potential serious risks such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and renal dysfunction. These results indicate that high-risk patients, particularly those with deteriorating BMD loss, may benefit from bisphosphonate treatment and should be promptly referred for evaluation. Future randomized trials are needed to evaluate the role of bisphosphonate treatment as a preventive measure among pediatric HSCT recipients.</p>
<p>Reported risk factors for development of AVN among HSCT survivors are inconclusive with regards to gender, age, corticosteroid dose, and TBI exposure. All studies indicated some relationship of AVN to corticosteroids; however, the dose and duration differ. Sample size and patient characteristics are limitations for all of these studies.</p>
<p>Since early detection and intervention of AVN dictates extent of morbidity, and risk factors for development of AVN are known, some clinicians have adopted a screening protocol for high-risk patients. Outside the setting of a clinical trial, this approach is not optimal. For screening to be effective, frequent imaging would be essential. However, because of the wide time range for detection after transplant (2-80 months), this approach is neither cost-effective nor practical in a pediatric and adolescent population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212473653">McAvoy et al., 2010</xref>). There is consensus that AVN remains a significant post-HSCT complication that can dramatically affect the quality of life of survivors. Prompt evaluation of symptoms and referral to an orthopedic specialist for high-risk patients is essential to achieve optimal outcomes. As discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043454212473653">Zadegan et al. (2008)</xref>, treatment of pediatric HSCT recipients with AVN requires collaboration between the HSCT team and the orthopedic surgeon to determine timing of intervention, treatment of infectious complications from surgery, and long-term rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Correlation between BMD and AVN is not supported in recent literature; however, the 2 can occur simultaneously, and the risk factors are similar. Calcium and vitamin D replacement as a preventative measure for bone destruction has been supported for patients expected to receive high-dose corticosteroids for at least 3 months. This recommendation is based on the recognition that BMD loss and AVN often occurs in patients with chronic illness taking multiple medications that affect bone resorption, and who have decreased physical mobility, poor nutritional habits, and lack of sun exposure. Assuming that most pediatric patients consume a diet with inadequate calcium and Vitamin D, and that the likelihood of toxicity from oral replacement is low, daily supplements of calcium and Vitamin D seem a reasonable preventive intervention.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The goal of this project was to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines for age-appropriate screening, prevention, and management of bone abnormalities in children post-HSCT. Overall, the level of evidence reviewed was low, a testament to the infancy of survivorship care for this patient population. However, the quality of the literature is strong, reflecting the consensus of leaders from major national and international professional organizations. These guidelines will provide the foundation for enhancing clinical care and serve as a building block for conducting prospective research studies. Future considerations for prevention and management of bone abnormalities among this population should include a cost–benefit ratio for the timing and frequency of DEXA scan, as well as quality outcomes for correcting changes in BMD loss earlier in the posttransplant course. These recommendations are applicable to patients receiving care in an outpatient center and reflect regional preferences and local health care resources with regards to management of osteopenia and the timing of endocrine referral. Adaption of these guidelines to other institutions/settings caring for this high-risk population should be feasible.</p>
