<p><bold>Background</bold>. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is a rapidly emerging approach to gallbladder disease. <bold>Methods</bold>. From February 2009 to September 2010, 60 patients were subjected to single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In all the patients, a 12-mm incision was made in the umbilicus and a 2-trocar technique was applied. Gallbladder was suspended with 2 sutures and the procedure was accomplished with standard partly reusable laparoscopic instruments. <bold>Results</bold>. In all, 41 women (68.3%) and 19 men (31.7%) were enrolled in this study. Mean age was 50.7 years (range = 17-72 years), mean body mass index was 26.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range = 18.3-37.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and mean operative time was 52.6 minutes (range = 30-120 minutes). No mortality or morbidity was recorded and hospital stay was less than 24 hours. At follow-up visits, no complications were recorded and cosmesis was excellent. <bold>Conclusion</bold>. Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be safely performed with conventional instrumentation with minimal cost.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ever since Phillipe Mouret performed the first video-laparoscopic cholecystectomy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612438411">1</xref></sup> we have reached to a point where the laparoscopic approach to gallbladder diseases has become the gold standard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612438411">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612438411">3</xref></sup> Currently, surgeons powered by industry and on patient request are seeking for even less invasive procedures. The latter has lead to the evolution of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), a scareless minimally invasive technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612438411">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612438411">5</xref></sup> Incisionless surgery is expected to reduce postoperative pain, wound complications, and hospital stay, and provide erobust cosmesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612438411">6</xref></sup> NOTES has been recently performed in humans and it has been shown to be safe and effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612438411">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612438411">5</xref></sup> Nevertheless, many surgeons remain skeptical as to the safety of the novel technique with the most serious drawbacks arising from the intentional puncture of a hollow viscous, the safety of closure, and the potential intraperitoneal infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612438411">7</xref></sup> For these reasons, the widespread use of NOTES has been halted for the time being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612438411">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Surgeons’ reluctance to use NOTES has left space for the emergence of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612438411">9</xref></sup> In contrast to NOTES, SILS does not encompass hollow-organ puncture; does not require specialized training or equipment unfamiliar to the surgeon, and thus, it has been adopted as a step toward incisionless surgery. Unlike NOTES, at present there is no consensus name for single-incision laparoscopic surgery and most of the currently used acronyms are industrial trademarks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612438411">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, the technique has not been standardized yet, and a wide variety of instrumentation and techniques have been reported in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612438411">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612438411"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612438411"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612438411"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612438411">15</xref></sup> all of which are aiming at better technical access but are associated with increased cost.</p>
<p>In the present retrospective study, we aim to evaluate our experience in SILS cholecystectomy with conventional rigid instrumentation with particular focus on the safety and efficacy of the technique as well as the perioperative morbidity, the learning curve, the cosmetic result, and the cost effectiveness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1553350612438411" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Material and Methods</title>
<p>From February 2009 to September 2010, a total of 60 patients underwent single-incision cholecystectomy. The prospectively collected data from all patients were analyzed retrospectively. All patients had a previous diagnosis of symptomatic gallbladder stone disease but no ongoing inflammation or contraindications for conventional laparoscopy. Prior to the elective procedure, all patients were subjected to ultrasonography. All procedures were performed by the same surgeon (IK) at the University Hospital of Patras. Patients were informed about the possible benefits and the potential complications of the novel technique and a written inform consent was obtained.</p>
<p>Patient demographic data, body mass index (BMI), operative time—defined as time from incision to time of closure—surgical pathology, perioperative morbidity, and length of hospital stay were recorded in our database. To evaluate the learning curve, operative times were compared retrospectively with the corresponding times of standard 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed by the same surgeon in 60 patients, matched for demographic, anthropometric, and pathologic features. Furthermore, postoperative pain was traced by means of a visual analogue score that was carried out at 2-hour intervals postoperatively until patient discharge. On discharge, pain medications were not routinely prescribed and in the event of postoperative pain patients were advised to contact their surgeon.</p>
<p>Following hospital discharge, all patients were contacted on the 7th postoperative day and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively, while the vast majority was also seen 1 year after the procedure. At follow-up visits the incision was inspected for complications, that is, infection, seroma formation, and hernia, and the cosmetic result was evaluated.</p>
<p>Finally, based on the cost data retrieved from the accounting records of our hospital and the manufacturer suggested prices, a cost analysis of SILS cholecystectomy with conventional instrumentation was undertaken and the data were compared with the standard 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy and SILS with multiport access device and reticulating instruments.</p>
<p>All values are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, unless otherwise stated. The mean values of all parameters were compared using Student’s <italic>t</italic> test. All reported <italic>P</italic> values are 2-sided and significant at a level of <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05.</p>
<sec id="section3-1553350612438411">
<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>Patient was placed in a supine position with both the surgeon and the assistant standing on the patients’ left side. Pneumoperitoneum was established by a Veress needle placed left subcostally at the midclavicular line and maintained at 12 mm Hg. A 12-mm skin incision was made through the umbilicus and the umbilicus was pulled out to expose the fascia. A 10-mm trocar (Versaport Plus RPF 5-10 mm with 100-mm radiolucent sleeve, Covidien, North Haven, CT) was introduced and the abdominal cavity was explored with a 10-mm extra long (460 mm working length) 30° scope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). A second 5-mm working trocar (Versaport Plus RPF 5-10 mm with 100-mm radiolucent sleeve, Covidien) was placed cephally to the optical trocar through a second fascial incision.</p>
<p>A 0 nylon suture attached to Keith needle (Ethilon, Ethicon, Cininnati, OH) was inserted right subcostally at the midclavicular line under direct intracorporal vision. The needle was then placed through the fundus of the gallbladder and returned through the abdominal wall near the origin of insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612438411">Figure 1A</xref>). Cephaled retraction of the suture facilitated both exposure of the gallbladder infudibulum and the triangle of Calot. Thereafter, a second similar suture was introduced right subcostally at the midaxillary line, placed through the infudibulum, and returned again near the site of insertion to achieve lateral traction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612438411">Figure 1B</xref>). Balanced traction of these sutures during the operation allowed excellent exposure of the Calot’s triangle.</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient was then placed in an anti-Trendelenburg position and rotated to the left in a similar fashion to standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The cystic duct and artery were first exposed with a reusable conventional dissector, then separately clipped with a standard 5-mm clip applier (Endoclip 5-mm clip applier, Ethicon Endosurgery, Cininnati, OH; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612438411">Figure 1C</xref>), and finally divided with reusable scissors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612438411">Figure 1D</xref>). Gallbladder bed dissection was carried out with a hook dissector. Following completion of the cholecystectomy the abdominal cavity was thoroughly lavaged. Thereafter, the suspended sutures were removed and the specimen was extracted in a bag (Endocatch bag, Covidien, North Haven, CT) that was blindly introduced through the optical trocar. The fascial defect was closed in all patients with absorbable 2-0 sutures.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Patient characteristics and operative details are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612438411">Table 1</xref>. All but one procedure were concluded successfully with no need for insertion of additional trocars or conversion to open. In one occasion, the patient had multiple episodes of biliary colics and the duodenum was densely adherent to the inferior liver margin rendering gallbladder mobilization dangerous. In this patient, the procedure was completed in a standard laparoscopic fashion, and the patient had an uneventful recovery. The operative times of single port compared with 4-port cholecystectomy are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612438411">Figure 2</xref>. Though there was a significant difference in the mean operative times among the 2 groups (52.6 vs 41.9 minutes, <italic>P</italic> = .001), the operative time gradually decreased in the SILS group and for the last 30 procedures it was comparable between the 2 techniques.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a relatively simple procedure associated with low morbidity and short convalescence. For these reasons, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is one of the most common procedures in general surgery superseding the open approach to gallbladder diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612438411">6</xref></sup> SILS cholecystectomy has emerged as an effort to decrease ports as a step toward incisionless surgery. However, apart from the improved cosmesis, it is doubtful whether the new technique can compete with the gold standard. There are certain aspects that have to be explored before the adaptation of the novel technique such as the safety, the possible benefits, and the cost. With these thoughts, we undertook a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 60 consecutive patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease, who were subjected to SILS cholecystectomy at our institution.</p>
<p>Although SILS cholecystectomy has been described since 1999 by Navarra et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612438411">16</xref></sup> there was a paucity of data; and only recently, studies with sufficient manpower have emerge in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612438411">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612438411"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612438411"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612438411">20</xref></sup> In the aforementioned studies, SILS cholecystectomy has been shown to be feasible, but it is technically more demanding in comparison with the standard approach. The major disadvantages of SILS cholecystectomy is that triangulation, a dominant rule in laparoscopic procedures, is jeopardized, since optical and working ports are introduced through the same skin incision. This necessitates in-line viewing with limited and compromised view. The latter has been partially overcome with the use of angled or flexible laparoscopes but the issue of limited working space for surgeons and assistant hands still remains. To overcome these inherited difficulties in SILS ergonomics multiport devices and instruments and ports, as well as articulating instruments, of different lengths have been proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612438411">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612438411">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612438411">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612438411">14</xref></sup> All these proposals are associated with increased cost and demand further training on part of the surgeon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612438411">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, we performed 60 SILS procedures with 2 standard laparoscopic trocars and a conventional, long, 30° laparoscope. Viewing and exposure difficulties were overcome by means of 2 sutures. With balanced traction of these sutures, we could achieve an excellent suspension of the gallbladder while gaining space from an additional working port. With the use of only 2 trocars, we were able to minimize the conflict of working instruments and minimize pneumoperitoneum leakage from port dislodgement.</p>
<p>Romanelli and Earle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612438411">10</xref></sup> in a recent review of SILS bring about the issue of articulating instruments and underline the need of surgical experience. In the present study, we were able to flatten the learning curve with the use of rigid conventional instruments with which we were familiar. Operative time decreased substantially and rapidly from 2 hours in the first SILS cholecystectomy to a mean of 52.5 minutes, which is a rather acceptable time, comparable with the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and relatively lower in comparison with other reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612438411">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612438411">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350612438411"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612438411">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are few studies in the literature where the learning curve is explored. According to some authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612438411">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350612438411">23</xref></sup> no special training is required and the cutoff point in the learning curve is rather low, such as 5 or 10 procedures. According to Allemann et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350612438411">24</xref></sup> the above results should be interpreted with cautiousness, since previous laparoscopic experience is not taken into account and that these reports come from centers were expertise in minimally invasive surgery is rather high. We believe that the cutoff point is much higher and beyond this point operative times should be equivalent to those achieved by the conventional laparoscopic approach. In the present cohort Furthermore, when we compared the operative times of patients subjected to SILS cholecystectomy with that of their counterparts subjected to standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy we found a significant difference in the operative times only for the first 30 SILS procedures. Thereafter, operative times were equivalent among the 2 groups setting a clear cutoff point on the learning curve.</p>
<p>The issue of safety in SILS cholecystectomy has been studied thoroughly in various studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612438411">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612438411">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350612438411">25</xref></sup> In a recent review of the literature of SILS cholecystectomies, Allemann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350612438411">24</xref></sup> report an overall complication rate of 5.4%, with biliary complications accounting for 0.7%, thus exceeding the corresponding morbidity of the standard laparoscopic technique. The higher morbidity of SILS is further supported by the retrospective study of Edwards et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612438411">17</xref></sup> on 80 SILS cholecystectomies, were morbidity was 8.7% and biliary complications accounted for 3.7%. A possible explanation for the high morbidity in the latter study is the fact that SILS was applied even in complicated cases—20 cases of cholecystitis operated on by 7 surgeons presumably with different background. In our cohort, all procedures were performed by the same highly experienced surgical team and only in elective cases. Nevertheless, in one patient with a history of multiple biliary colics and possibly an obscure previous inflammation, gallbladder exposure was not feasible because of dense adhesions of the duodenum with the inferior surface of the liver. In this patient, cholecystectomy was easily and safely achieved in a standard laparoscopic fashion, a fact that proves the flexibility of the technique as soon as technical difficulties arise.</p>
<p>Compromised view and poor identification of all structures in the triangle of Calot is presumably a significant factor for the avoidance of bile duct injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1553350612438411">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1553350612438411">27</xref></sup> In our cohort, we were able to nullify such complications with excellent exposure of the triangle of Calot by means of gallbladder suspension with transparietal stitches. The latter have been criticized because of bile leakage which may result in septic postoperative complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350612438411">24</xref></sup> This may be true in cases of infected bile in acute cholecystitis. However, SILS cholecystectomy was applied electively in our case and no significant bile spillage was recorded. Furthermore, following the completion of the procedure, the abdominal cavity was thoroughly lavaged.</p>
<p>Provided that the surgical trauma is minimal in SILS cholecystectomy, a reduction of the postoperative pain is expected. Tsimoyiannis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1553350612438411">28</xref></sup> in a recent randomized clinical trial have shown significant less pain after SILS in comparison with the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1553350612438411">28</xref></sup>In the present study, though postoperative pain was not compared with the standard approach it was traced by means of a visual analogue score. According to our experience pain was moderate in the first postoperative hours, diminished rapidly, and vanished by the time of discharge. Furthermore, no pain medications were needed in the early postoperative period. This is a significant advantage of the novel technique, rendering it especially attractive for more complex procedures.</p>
<p>Although SILS represent a step toward incisionless surgery, surgical wound complications are not uncommon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612438411">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612438411">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1553350612438411">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1553350612438411">30</xref></sup> and cosmesis can be put at risk. In our cohort, patients were evaluated for sufficient time postoperatively and no complications from the surgical wound site were recorded. A possible explanation is the use of only 2 trocars, with which we were able to reduce fascial punctures, thus avoiding weakening of the fascia, which could lead to hernia development. Furthermore, SILS was applied only for elective procedures, and thus the risk of septic wound complications was minimal. For these reasons wound healing was optimal and the cosmetic result was excellent.</p>
<p>The issue of BMI for SILS procedures has not been clarified. Although, currently, bariatric procedures are being performed by various surgical teams,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1553350612438411">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1553350612438411"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1553350612438411">33</xref></sup> in the vast majority of studies, in SILS cholecystectomy the mean BMI barely exceeds 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612438411">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612438411">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350612438411">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612438411">22</xref></sup> In agreement with these studies, in the present cohort our mean BMI was 26.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. We believe that SILS cholecystectomy in obese patients would be difficult, if not impossible to perform with suture retraction, because of the massive liver. Furthermore, multiple adjacent fascial punctures would increase the risk of incisional hernia in this population. For the above reasons, we believe that our technique is not applicable to morbidly obese patients.</p>
<p>In an era of global economic crisis, the cost of a procedure is of outmost importance especially in a public hospital. SILS technique has not yet been standardized and there is a wide variety of instrumentation including multiport access devices and articulating instruments, which significantly increase the total cost. Efforts to decrease operative cost have been reported in the literature;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612438411">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1553350612438411">34</xref></sup> Love et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1553350612438411">35</xref></sup> in a recent study has shown that the cost of SILS is not significantly different from the cost of traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy when standard materials are used. In agreement with the aforementioned study, in our cohort with the use of partially reusable standard instrumentation we were able to decrease significantly the cost of SILS to a point that it was comparable to the conventional technique.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been gaining popularity driven by patients’ desire for scarless surgery and by surgeons and industries, who are seeking even less invasive procedures. At the hands of an experienced surgeon, SILS cholecystectomy can be safely and effectively performed with conventional instrumentation, thus with minimal cost. Although there may be certain benefits of SILS cholecystectomy such as decreased pain and excellent cosmesis, safety issues should always be counted first and serious attention should be paid on patient selection. Since the technique has not been standardized, SILS should not be widely adopted but rather preserved for elective cases.</p>
