<p>Orsanmichele is a most peculiar, ‘enigmatic’ (p. 37), and memorable building. It was erected in 1337 in Florence, Italy, on the site of the Monastery of St Michael and named after the kitchen garden of that monastery. Originally a grain market until 1371, it became a chapel for the craft guilds of Florence. The second floor contained offices, and the third was the storehouse for the city’s grain, which was to be used in case of siege or famine and for distribution to the poor. Early in the 15th century, the guilds commissioned statues of their patron saints to decorate the facade of the church. These statues were placed in 14 external niches that were part of the architectural design.</p>
<p><italic>Orsanmichele</italic> is an opulent, richly illustrated, and fascinating book. It contains 22 essays of varying length and focus that deal not only with the complex history of this building but especially with the magnificent sculptures that adorn the niches on its sides. There is also an illuminating chapter by Gert Kreytenberg on the limestone tracery on the arches of the original grain loggia. Artur Rosenauer makes a compelling case for the importance of the sculptures, calling Orsanmichele the ‘birthplace of modern sculpture’. These figures of marble and bronze, having suffered discoloration and deterioration over the course of time because of pollution and the forces of nature, have been removed for restoration and have been replaced with copies. Most of the restored originals are displayed in a museum on the second floor, which is open to the public on a limited basis.</p>
<p>The chapters cover a broad spectrum of issues, some very technical, relating to composition and preservation of the statues. Many which discuss the history and current state of Orsanmichele and the individual works are of great interest. The sculptors Brunelleschi, Donatello, Ghiberti, Verocchio, Nanni di Banco (greatly underrated), and Giambologna are well-represented at Orsanmichele, making a compelling case for Rosenauer’s claim.</p>
<p>There is an important chapter by Francesco Cagliotti on Giovanni di Balduccio’s marble reliefs on the marble facade of Orsanmichele, which have been inadequately studied. Balduccio’s works (1334–1336) appeared earlier than the niche statues, and many of them have been dispersed to various museums. His work is quite remarkable and has not had the attention it deserves.</p>
<p>A chapter by Blake Wilson, ‘If Monuments Could Sing’, traces the importance of music at Orsanmichele, and the building’s suitability for religious music. It was believed that <italic>laudesi</italic> (sung devotions) were ‘an especially sanctified form of persuasion, for they participate in the celestial singing of the angelic choir’ (p. 113). Wilson makes the point that the melodies of many secular songs (<italic>ballata minore</italic>) were adapted to religious texts, a practice later vehemently forbidden by the Council of Trent.</p>
<p>Several chapters describe the restoration project and the two-part symposium with international presenters in Washington and Florence that generated the material for this book. The symposia marked the culmination of a 20-year campaign to remove the statues from the exterior niches of the building, and the 30th year of passionate and dedicated service by Annamaria Giusti to the conservation of stone sculpture. She is impressed by ‘how fragile these masterpieces really are, and how imperfect is our capacity to preserve them’ (p. 185). The Tabernacle of Orcagna was excluded from this study since its excellent restoration was completed a century ago.</p>
<p><italic>Orsanmichele</italic> is an elegant work with superb reproductions and flawless scholarship, is easily accessible to the informed reader, and will be a valued addition to any library.</p>
