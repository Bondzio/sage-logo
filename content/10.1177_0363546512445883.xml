<title>Background:</title>
<p>Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is an increasingly common diagnosis in active patients with hip pain. Surgical options for FAI include arthroscopy, open surgical dislocation, or mini–direct anterior approaches. Arthroscopic and open treatments of FAI have been commonly performed and have had promising results in athletes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512445883">
<title>Hypothesis/Purpose:</title>
<p>We hypothesized that the mini–direct anterior approach would provide the advantages of a minimally invasive procedure and still allow adequate exposure of the hip joint to successfully treat FAI in an athletic population. The purpose of this study was to determine if a mini-open approach for the treatment of FAI in athletic patients would allow a return to preoperative activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512445883">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512445883">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A total of 234 patients (257 hips) with FAI were treated by a mini-open approach; 59 were athletic patients (66 hips) with a preoperative University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score of 7 or higher or Super Simple Hip (SUSHI) activity score of 70 or greater. Forty-four of the 59 athletic patients (47 hips) have reached 1-year minimum follow-up. No patients were lost to follow-up. The mini-open approach was performed through a 4-cm incision and modified Smith-Peterson approach with no muscle detachment. All patients were prospectively evaluated using the following outcome measures: preoperative and postoperative UCLA activity, Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), modified Harris Hip Score (HHS), and SUSHI scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512445883">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The average age at the time of surgery was 32 years (range, 17-60 years), with an average follow-up of 22 months. Labral changes—whether tear, detachment, or ossification—were present in all patients, and 84% had chondral lesions. The mean HHS improved from 55 preoperatively to 79 postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The WOMAC scores also improved from 47.9 to 8.3 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Mean SF-36 scores improved from 65 to 85 postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The mean preoperative SUSHI general score was 31.1, pain score was 26.6, and limitation score was 28.9. The mean postoperative SUSHI general score was 53.6, pain score was 47.5, and limitation score was 51.6 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). There was minimal change from preinjury to postoperative UCLA (8.0 to 8.7, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .07) or SUSHI activity scores (76.3 to 67.7, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .048), indicating a reliable return to preinjury activity levels. Twenty-four of 44 patients (55%) reported a return to their specific preoperative sports. Nine patients (20%) developed meralgia paresthetica postoperatively, which resolved within 1 year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512445883">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The mini-open approach for the treatment of FAI is a safe and effective procedure that allows surgical treatment of FAI in athletic patients and a successful return to high activity levels. The outcome of the mini-open approach for athletes may be comparable with open and arthroscopic treatment of FAI.</p>

<body>
<p>In recent years, the concept of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) has become popularized, the prevalence of which has been shown to be 10% to 15% in young active patients and up to 94% of young patients with hip pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512445883">8</xref></sup> Hence, orthopaedic surgeons, sports medicine physicians, and family practitioners may frequently encounter patients with FAI. Currently, there are no studies to predict the natural history of this condition. It is, however, believed that without adequately addressing the underlying pathological abnormalities, hips in athletes with FAI may quickly deteriorate and preclude them from returning to impact sports. The repetitive abnormal contact between the femoral neck and the acetabular rim leads to labral damage and eventual degeneration of the acetabular articular cartilage, which manifest most often in active athletic patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512445883">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512445883">11</xref></sup> Those with symptomatic FAI who fail to improve despite nonoperative treatment may require surgical intervention to address their pain and allow them to return to function. For many young athletes, the ability to return to sports or high levels of activity is the main treatment goal. Therefore, it is important to determine the optimal method and timing of treatment to maximize recovery of function and resolution of pain.</p>
<p>It is theorized that failing to correct the bony impingement, labral tears, and chondral lesions will prevent full unrestricted return to activity and ultimately lead to accelerated degeneration of the hip joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512445883">7</xref></sup> The main technical goals of surgery for FAI are to perform osteoplasty to remove the cam and/or pincer bony deformities, to repair or debride the labral injury, and to address chondral lesions with either chondroplasty and/or microfracture. Three different approaches are currently being performed: arthroscopy, minimally invasive open repair, and open surgical dislocation, each with their advantages and disadvantages. Prior studies have shown successful results in returning athletes to sports after arthroscopic treatment of FAI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512445883">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512445883">17</xref></sup> Proponents of arthroscopy have hypothesized that any open treatment of FAI, either mini-open or surgical dislocation, in the higher level athletic population might preclude a return to full sports participation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512445883">17</xref></sup> A recent study by Naal et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512445883">14</xref></sup> however, reported a 96% return to professional sports after surgical dislocation for the treatment of FAI. However, there are no current studies that evaluate the results of the mini-open anterior approach to treat FAI in an athletic population.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the mini-open approach might combine the advantages of the arthroscopic and open surgical dislocation approaches for the treatment of FAI. The purpose of this study was to describe the surgical technique and determine clinical results of the mini-open femoroacetabular osteoplasty (FAO) procedure in active athletic patients. In addition, we sought to determine the results of preoperative and postoperative activity scales and patient-reported outcomes.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Mini-open FAO was performed by the senior author (J.P.) on 234 consecutive patients (257 hips) with FAI with hip pain between January 2006 and August 2010. Of these patients, 59 patients (66 hips) were athletic, ranging from amateur runners to professional athletes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512445883">Table 1</xref>), with a preoperative University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score of 7 or higher or Super Simple Hip (SUSHI) activity score of 70 or greater. On the basis of these scores, patients were considered highly active in sports activities before the development of hip pain. Any patient who had a UCLA activity score below 7 and SUSHI activity score below 70 was excluded from the study. The UCLA activity score ranges from 1 to 10, with level 1 signifying no physical activity and dependence on others and level 10 demonstrating regular participation in impact sports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512445883">13</xref></sup> The SUSHI activity scale looks at the most active state that a patient was in within the past year. The scale assigns 5 to 25 points to each of the following activities depending on frequency, with a 25 being 4 or more times a week: running, pivoting while playing a sport (including kicking, hitting a golf ball, throwing, etc), squatting or deep hip flexion, and jumping.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512445883">9</xref></sup> Therefore, the majority of these patients were still very active up until the time of surgery, and those who were not had been very active during the year before surgery. Prior to initiation of this study, institutional review board approval was obtained.</p>

<p>The right hip was treated in 40 patients, and the left was treated in 26 patients. One patient had bilateral FAO performed in 1 procedure. Twenty-one patients were female, and 38 were male, with an average age of 32.0 years (range, 17-60 years) at the time of surgery.</p>
<p>Forty-four patients (47 hips) have reached a minimum 1-year follow-up, with an average follow-up of 22 months (range, 12-38 months). No patients were lost to follow-up. Average height and weight of the patients were 176 cm (range, 158-196 cm) and 78.9 kg (range, 49-153 kg), respectively, and the average body mass index was 25.5 (range, 18.3-39.3). Based on preoperative radiographs, 17 hips had Tonnis grade 0 osteoarthritis (OA), 25 hips had Tonnis grade 1 OA, and 4 hips had Tonnis grade 2 OA. Preoperative radiographs were not available for 1 patient. Preoperative radiographs were reviewed to measure anterosuperior joint space, Tonnis angle, femoral neck-shaft angle, lateral center edge angle, extrusion index, and presence of a crossover sign and coxa profunda.</p>
<p>The mean intraoperative time was 75 minutes (range, 64-115 minutes), with a mean estimated blood loss of 120 mL (range, 50-350 mL). All of the patients reported participating in sports or vigorous physical activity before hip problems began to limit them (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512445883">Table 1</xref>). Postoperative questionnaires were used to determine whether patients were able to return to the sport or activity that they were able to do before the development of hip problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546512445883">
<title>Clinical Presentation</title>
<p>The diagnosis of FAI was made based on clinical and imaging findings. All patients in this series had groin pain during activity. They also had pain at rest when sitting and/or pain at night. On physical examination, pain was elicited with flexion, adduction, and internal rotation of the hip (impingement sign).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512445883">6</xref></sup> Before surgical consideration, all patients had undergone and failed a trial of nonoperative therapy including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or physical therapy. Additionally, all patients underwent intra-articular local anesthetic and/or corticosteroid injections either alone or in conjunction with their imaging studies to determine their responses and confirm intra-articular abnormalities. Despite the presence of substantial hip pain, 47% of patients (28 of 59) continued to participate in impact sports until the time of surgery.</p>
<p>Patients were evaluated preoperatively with pelvis radiographs and magnetic resonance (MR) arthrograms. Radiographs including anteroposterior view of the pelvis, Dunn view, and/or lateral view of the hip were performed to search for osseous deformities of the hip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512445883">Figure 1</xref>), and MR arthrograms have been shown to be accurate for the diagnosis of labral disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512445883">1</xref></sup> Fifty-nine hips had primarily cam-type impingement, and 7 hips had combined pincer and cam impingement based on imaging studies. None of the hips had isolated pincer-type impingement. Acetabular labral tears or labral degeneration was identified by MR arthrogram or intraoperatively in all patients.</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>See the video supplement, available in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>. The patients were positioned supine on a regular operating table with all bony prominences padded. The operative leg was draped free. The hip region from umbilicus to upper thigh was also prepared and draped. We then placed a 3- to 4-cm incision distal to the anterior superior iliac spine over the tensor fascia lata muscle.</p>
<p>Then, the perimysium covering the tensor fascia lata was identified and divided. The tensor muscle was retracted laterally, and the underlying perimysium was cut to expose the rectus femoris. Care was taken to avoid the interval between the sartorius muscle and the tensor fascia lata to protect the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve of the thigh. The rectus femoris was then reflected laterally without division to expose the underlying capsule. A blunt-tipped curved retractor was then placed laterally around the capsule, overlying the neck of the femur. Next, the sartorius muscle was retracted medially to expose the medial capsule of the femoral neck. At this point, the ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery was ligated or electrocoagulated. The retractors were then moved inside the joint once an I-shaped capsulotomy was performed. A sharp-tipped retractor with a light source was then placed at the upper part of the anterior inferior iliac spine and medial to the origin of the rectus femoris. The hip was flexed during insertion of this retractor, and the cam deformity of the femoral head-neck junction was visualized. The area of abutment between the femoral neck and acetabular rim was confirmed with flexion of the hip. The labrum was then examined for evidence of tear and/or degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512445883">Figure 2</xref>). A nerve hook was used to feel the articular side of the labrum for presence of tear.</p>

</fig>
<p>To expose the articular cartilage to identify chondral lesions, the labrum was detached free of the rim in the area of the tear in 15 hips. A healthy labrum was not detached in any of the cases. Manual traction was also applied to the extremity. As the capsule was opened, fairly minimal traction allowed adequate subluxation of the hip and visualization of the weightbearing dome region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512445883">Figure 3</xref>). The central compartment of the hip was also visible in the majority of cases. Using the mini-open approach, we could visualize about 60% to 70% of the acetabular cavity. The only portion difficult to visualize was the posteroinferior part of the socket. The articular cartilage in the posteroinferior part of the socket was felt using a blunt-tipped nerve hook. Chondral lesions were excised in 32 hips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512445883">Figure 4</xref>), and microfracture was performed for full-thickness lesions in 6 hips. Acetabuloplasty was performed to take down the extra rim (between 2-5 mm) using a curved osteotome in 36 hips. The amount of rim resection was determined by the magnitude of overcoverage and extent of chondral lesion as detected intraoperatively, but excessive (&gt;1 cm) resection was avoided to prevent instability. After acetabular rim trimming, the femoral head-neck junction was examined. The “bump” was located in the anterosuperior region and had a characteristic reddish appearance of a cartilaginous surface. The retinacular vessels were always visualized in this region also and protected. Osteoplasty of the neck was performed using a combination of osteotome and pneumatic bur. The articular cartilage on the femoral head was protected by releasing manual traction and allowing the head to sit inside the acetabulum. The extent of bone removal was determined by the re-creation of smooth contour of the head-neck junction and achievement of impingement-free range of motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512445883">Figure 5</xref>). The visualization of the lateral neck was maximized by internal rotation of the hip. The posteroinferior part of the neck was also reached by placing the leg in a figure-of-4 position. After completion of the bone resection, the labrum was repaired with the use of anchor sutures to the underlying cancellous acetabular rim, which had been trimmed down to bleeding bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546512445883">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>The hip joint was then irrigated thoroughly, and bone wax was applied to areas of bone resection on the femoral neck. After a final check of range of motion, the capsule was closed with a running suture, and the wound was closed in layers.</p>
<p>All patients were discharged home after a 1-day hospital stay. Postoperatively, patients were allowed partial weightbearing using crutches for 6 weeks and then allowed full weightbearing afterward. Patients began physical therapy at approximately 6 weeks as well as a home exercise routine. Return to full activity was allowed once range of motion and strength were restored and pain reduced, typically 4 to 6 months postoperatively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546512445883">
<title>Outcomes Assessment</title>
<p>Clinical outcomes, including postoperative complications, return to sporting activity, and range of motion, were recorded. Preoperative status and postoperative outcomes were evaluated using the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Harris Hip Score (HHS), UCLA activity scale, lower limb activity scale, and SUSHI score at each follow-up visit. The UCLA score ranges from 1 to 10, with 1 being wholly inactive and unable to leave residence and 10 being regular participation in impact sports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512445883">13</xref></sup> The SUSHI survey is a validated scoring system targeted toward young active patients who undergo hip surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512445883">9</xref></sup> It comprises 4 parts: general, pain, limitation, and activity. General, pain, and limitation scores are added and divided by 2 to give a score of 0 to 100. The SUSHI activity score has a minimum of 25 and maximum of 100. A higher score indicates improvement, and the activity score comprises a series of questions about maximum level of activity in the past year. The questions are intended to reduce the ceiling effect often seen with HHS and WOMAC surveys in extremely active patients. Forty-four patients (47 hips) were seen in the clinic or contacted by telephone to obtain surveys, with an average follow-up of 22 months (range, 12-38 months). Preoperative and postoperative scores were compared using a paired Student <italic>t</italic> test. Continuous variables from radiographic measurements were compared using an independent <italic>t</italic> test, and categorical variables were compared using the Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> test. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 18.0.1 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

<p>Osteoplasty of the femoral head-neck region was performed in all 44 patients (47 hips), and acetabular osteoplasty was performed on 6 hips. All 47 hips had labral tear, detachment, or ossification. Labral repair was performed for labral tears and detachment with a healthy labrum in 37 hips, and an ossified/degenerated labrum was removed in 10 hips. Forty-one hips had acetabular chondral lesions, which averaged 47.8 mm<sup>2</sup> (range, 2 × 2 mm to 12 × 20 mm as measured by a ruler). Microfracture was performed on 6 hips for full-thickness chondral lesions.</p>

<title>Clinical Findings</title>
<p>Forty-four patients (47 hips) have reached a minimum of 1-year follow-up. The 15 athletic patients who have not yet reached 1 year of follow-up were excluded from our current data analysis. At a mean follow-up of 22 months (range, 12-38 months), none of the athletic patients who underwent FAO required total hip arthroplasty (THA) or repeat surgery on the operated hip. All except 2 patients experienced clinical improvement in pain and function in their hips postoperatively, based on WOMAC and HHS. One patient who did not show improvement after surgery had complex hip problems, including developmental dysplasia and a small fracture of the acetabular rim. She had failed arthroscopic surgery 6 months before mini-open FAO surgery and was subsequently limited to minimal activities of daily living and the use of crutches secondary to severe pain. This patient had not responded to anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, or previous arthroscopic treatment. Therefore, exploratory FAO was performed as a last option to repair the labrum and evaluate the intra-articular space. The patient understood that the FAO procedure had only a small chance of success in relieving her pain. The other patient was a football player who was doing well until 9 months postoperatively when he injured his hip during college football practice. Physical examination and radiographs of the hip were inconclusive in identifying the source of the patient’s pain. However, postinjury magnetic resonance imaging showed a possible partial tendon tear at the rectus femoris muscle insertion, which was likely the cause of the patient’s pain and decrease in activity.</p>
<p>The mean hip flexion improved from 84.9° (range, 60°-100°) preoperatively to 116.6° (range, 100°-140°) postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and mean hip internal rotation improved from 7.7° (range, –5° to 10°) preoperatively to 37.3° (range, 15°-45°) postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The mean HHS improved from 55 preoperatively to 79 postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The adjusted WOMAC scores also improved from 47.9 to 8.3 at latest follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Preoperatively, the UCLA and SUSHI activity scores were 8.0 and 76.3, respectively, and were slightly different from those at last follow-up (8.7 and 67.7, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .07 and <italic>P</italic> = .048, respectively). Mean SF-36 scores improved from 65 to 85 postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512445883">Table 2</xref>). Patient outcomes were also analyzed based on their preoperative Tonnis grade of OA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546512445883">Table 3</xref>). Clinically, 42 of 44 patients (95%) improved from their immediate preoperative activity level based on improvement in either UCLA and/or SUSHI activity scores. Twenty-four of 44 patients (55%) reported a return to their specific preoperative sports. Eighteen patients reported an increase in activity level postoperatively but not to the level of activity before the onset of hip problems. Two patients reported minimal or no improvement from their preoperative activity levels. Statistical analysis showed no difference in anterosuperior joint space, Tonnis angle, femoral neck-shaft angle, lateral center edge angle, extrusion index, presence of a crossover sign, and presence of coxa profunda between patients who reported a full return to their specific preoperative sports compared with patients with an incomplete return to their preoperative activity level (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05) (Appendix, available in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Complications</title>
<p>Nine of the 44 (20%) patients developed mild meralgia paresthetica after the surgery, caused by stretching of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which manifested as numbness in the anterolateral thigh of the affected side. This condition resolved within 1 year postoperatively in all 9 patients. One additional patient also developed complete femoral nerve palsy, which resolved after 6 months, likely secondary to overzealous retraction of the rectus femoris muscle. There were no other intraoperative or postoperative complications in this series.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Femoroacetabular impingement can be a disabling condition that prevents athletes from engaging in activities and performing well in their athletic pursuits. Our objective of surgical treatment for FAI in athletes is to resolve pain, improve range of motion, and allow them to perform without limitations. The surgical interventions for FAI are able to accomplish these goals by addressing the labral pathological changes and chondral lesions and removing the bony prominence on the femoral neck and/or acetabular rim. It is believed, but not proven, that the removal of osseous abnormalities may slow down the progression of arthritis that could occur as a result of continuous osseous abutment.</p>
<p>The optimal surgical procedure for the treatment of FAI in all patients, and in athletes in particular, is still debated. Open surgical dislocation was the initially accepted treatment for FAI described by Ganz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512445883">5</xref></sup> that involves correcting the abnormal shape of the hip and repairing the labrum. It allows for correction of abnormalities in cases of complex impingement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512445883">5</xref></sup> The midterm results of FAO and labral repair using surgical dislocation and trochanteric flip osteotomy in a group of 29 patients were recently reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512445883">15</xref></sup> At a mean follow-up of 32 months, the HHS was noted to have improved from 70 preoperatively to 87 postoperatively. Despite reported success with this procedure, it has been debated that surgical dislocation may not be ideal for athletic patients wishing to return to activity because of the trauma involved with trochanteric osteotomy, the potential for trochanteric nonunion, and the need for extended recovery and rehabilitation time with the restriction of nonweightbearing.</p>
<p>However, a recent study by Naal et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512445883">14</xref></sup> reported a high success rate of returning high-level athletes to sports after surgical dislocation to treat FAI. In this study of 22 professional athletes, 96% were able to return to professional-level sports. Objective postoperative activity and hip scores at 45-month follow-up were 9.8 for the UCLA activity scale and 89.1 for the Hip Outcome Score sports subscale. The authors concluded that open surgical dislocation to treat FAI was successful and not contraindicated in elite-level athletes.</p>
<p>Arthroscopic surgery has more recently been shown to provide good outcomes in athletic patients with FAI. Philippon et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512445883">18</xref></sup> showed that arthroscopic treatment of FAI and labral tears in professional hockey players results in a prompt return to hockey and high patient satisfaction. In their series of 28 patients, average HHS improved from 70 preoperatively to 95 at an average of 24 months’ follow-up. Comparatively, their return rate in hockey players was higher in this arthroscopically treated group than the open surgical dislocation group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512445883">14</xref></sup> Brunner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512445883">3</xref></sup> also reported on outcomes of arthroscopic osteoplasty in a group of 45 patients with FAI who had participated in active sports such as biking, hiking, and fitness before FAI symptoms. After surgery, 31 had returned to sports at a mean follow-up of 2.4 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512445883">3</xref></sup> Advantages of arthroscopic FAO are minimal scarring, lower blood loss, and no need for trochanteric osteotomy compared with surgical dislocation. However, the disadvantages are the technical difficulty, prolonged traction of the hip, associated complications such as perineal nerve palsy, and potential difficulty of assessing an adequate osteoplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512445883">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mini–direct anterior approach used by the senior author allows for good visualization of all involved structures, uses a minimal incision, and involves less trauma than surgical dislocation (no dislocation or trochanteric osteotomy). Arthroscopic assistance was not used in this study. However, there are a number of reports that describe successful results using this combined open and arthroscopic approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512445883">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512445883">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512445883">12</xref></sup> Clohisy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512445883">4</xref></sup> retrospectively reviewed 35 patients using a combined approach for cam FAI with an average age of 34 years. They found a 25-point postoperative improvement in HHS, a 21° improvement of the alpha angle, and OA progression in only 2 patients at 2-year follow-up. Laude et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512445883">10</xref></sup> also used a combined approach in 97 patients, with an average age of 33.4 years at an average follow-up of 58.3 months. They found a 29.1-point improvement in subjective evaluation using the nonarthritic hip score, but 11 patients developed progressive arthritis requiring total hip arthroplasty. Lincoln et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512445883">12</xref></sup> used a combined approach to treat cam FAI in 14 patients. At 2-year follow-up, they assessed range of motion, alpha angle, and HHS. They found improvement in postoperative hip flexion and internal rotation of 16° and 5°, respectively, a 21° improvement in the alpha angle, and an increase of 12 points on the HHS. They did not find any deterioration of Tonnis grades radiographically on follow-up.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of the mini-open anterior approach is the lack of visualization of the inferoposterior labrum and chondral lesions of the central compartment. Ultimately, the visualization of all structures is diminished when compared with open surgical dislocation. Nevertheless, the lesions are most commonly in the anterosuperior region of the acetabular rim and the nearby articular cartilage. Additionally, there was an appreciable risk (approximately 20%) of injury to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve in our series, all of which resolved over time. Similar to other techniques, there is also a short recovery time after this procedure, with return to weightbearing activities at 6 to 8 weeks as tolerated. We believe that this mini-open approach combines the advantages of a less traumatic minimally invasive surgery (arthroscopy) and the direct visualization that would otherwise only be obtained with an open surgical dislocation. In the senior author’s experience, this technique is an effective method to treat athletes with hip impingement while also addressing their needs to have a short recovery time to get back to athletic activity.</p>
<p>Many young athletic patients may not seek treatment until their pain is debilitating or affecting their athletic performance. Therefore, these patients with FAI may have severe damage to the labrum, acetabular articular cartilage, and advanced grades of arthritis. This is a problem specifically for athletes who seek better outcomes in terms of restoration of function compared with the average patient, despite having significant joint injuries. Multiple case series have demonstrated that patients with higher Tonnis classifications of OA in the hip tend to have worse outcomes in terms of pain and function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512445883">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512445883">7</xref></sup> While all patients in our series had UCLA activity scores ≥7 base on reported activity level within 1 year before surgery, athletes who had a low level of activity (UCLA &lt;7) at the time of surgery, probably caused by deterioration of their condition, had significantly worse recovery of activity level than athletes who were still able to perform much physical activity (UCLA ≥7) at presentation (<italic>P</italic> = .033) (Appendix, available online).</p>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that even mild to moderate hip OA in patients with FAI will not necessarily degenerate more quickly than hips without OA. Bardakos and Villar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512445883">2</xref></sup> showed that individual hip morphological characteristics may play a role in the progression of OA, specifically medial proximal femoral angle and presence of a posterior wall sign. In this study, we attempted to identify which radiographic factors, if any, might predict which athletes are more likely to fully regain their preoperative level of activity. On assessment of other possible preoperative radiographic and intraoperative predictors for a return to full activity, we were unable to identify any statistical significance likely because of inadequate sample size. Further investigation with larger cohorts needs to be performed.</p>
<p>A limitation of this study is that by using our inclusion/exclusion criteria, we may have excluded some patients who had waited for more than 1 year with significant loss of activity before undergoing FAO. However, the UCLA activity scale and SUSHI activity score were the only objective measures by which we could define our population of athletic patients. Another limitation of this study is difficulty defining return to sports or high level of activity. The UCLA scale includes any impact sport as a 10 of 10 on its scale, which may create a ceiling effect. For example, even if a patient scores a 10 both preoperatively and postoperatively, it is impossible to utilize this score to determine whether athletes such as wrestlers or lacrosse players were able to return to play at the same quality of their sport rather than returning to their sport at a lower performance level. Therefore, we reviewed all patient charts to identify whether patients reported being able to return to their sport of choice. Because this was a retrospective study, the earliest time return to activity was not specifically recorded. Patients were asked about their return to activity level at each visit or telephone follow-up. Nevertheless, patient return to activity was early, with 42 of the 44 patients reporting improvement in activity by 6 months of follow-up. Also, our selection criteria of patients with high preoperative UCLA and SUSHI activity scores may also have affected our results regarding significance of improvement in the UCLA or SUSHI activity scale. Furthermore, some of the patients in this series were amateur athletes. Although only 55% of patients reported a return to their preoperative sport, the other patients may have chosen to avoid their preoperative sport of choice even if able to participate. Patients were also counseled to avoid impact sports after FAO surgery. Finally, the retrospective nature of this study is an inherent limitation by design.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Early-term outcomes of the mini-open approach for the treatment of FAI in athletes are encouraging. The mini-open approach allows for good visualization of the joint, intraoperative testing of range of motion, and repeat osteoplasty until obtaining the desired range of motion, while maintaining the benefits of shorter surgery time, low blood loss, and a relatively short recovery period that a minimally invasive procedure affords. Therefore, the mini-open approach for FAO may be a viable alternative to arthroscopy and surgical dislocation for the treatment of FAI in the young athletic population. Nevertheless, technical challenges of treating FAI through any approach and differences in patient selection criteria make it difficult to compare results across multiple studies. Longer term follow-up and randomized trials comparing the treatment modalities for FAI (arthroscopy vs mini-open vs open surgical dislocation) need to be conducted in order to determine the ideal treatment method for athletic patients.</p>
