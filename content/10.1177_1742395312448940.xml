<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> Recently, disclosure of cancer diagnosis is common in Japan, but significant variability in patient preference of prognostic disclosure poses difficult questions for doctors. The aim of this study was to understand the reasons for wanting or not wanting to know life prognosis and how the information was interpreted and utilized by the patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study was based on narrative interviews with 42 women with breast cancer and 49 men with prostate cancer, in varying stages. A qualitative and interpretive approach was taken, combining thematic analysis with constant comparison.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> While some of the participants voluntarily asked for prognosis to prepare themselves for the end of life, others were shocked by unexpected and unilateral disclosure. Some obtained prognostic information from books and websites. Some preferred to remain unaware of life prognosis, partly because they feared it would become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The major problem underlying the practice of prognostic disclosure is the absence of mutual understanding of how such information will be utilized. These findings affirm that it should be used to empower patients to participate in the decision-making process.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742395312448940" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the most difficult issues facing healthcare professionals is telling cancer patients about their diagnosis and prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312448940">1</xref></sup> Despite general agreement about the benefits of open communication between professionals and patients, there is still strong resistance against disclosure of cancer diagnosis and prognosis in many cultures, particularly in Asian, Middle-Eastern and Mediterranean regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312448940">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prior to the early 1980s, cancer patients in Japan were generally not told of their diagnosis, as Japanese physicians deemed it unethical to reveal what they considered a “death sentence” and patients were also reluctant to know their true condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395312448940">3</xref></sup> However, there has been a dramatic shift in the past several decades in Japanese patients’ preference for diagnostic disclosure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312448940">4</xref></sup> Medical advances enable early cancer detection and a wider variety of treatment choices; thus disclosure of cancer diagnosis is no longer perceived as a death sentence. Surveys have shown a steady increase for preferred disclosure of cancer diagnosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312448940">5</xref></sup> and a recent survey revealed that 80.7% of the general public preferred to be told of their cancer diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395312448940">6</xref></sup> The actual cancer disclosure rate in Japan has also risen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742395312448940">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312448940">9</xref></sup> According to the 2006 nationwide survey of 1540 hospitals, the mean proportion of cancer patients who had been told of their diagnosis (the disclosure rates in this survey were estimates made by respondents, such as the hospital director or the head of the palliative care department (Kodama, personal correspondence, 1 Dec 2011)) was 59.3% in hospitals with less than 50 beds and 83.3% in those with over 500 beds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312448940">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to the increase in the diagnostic disclosure rate, the disclosure of prognosis involving information about patients’ survival remains low. According to the above survey, the mean proportion of patients who had been told of the expected length of life was 19.8% for hospitals with less than 50 beds and 33.7% for those with over 500 beds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312448940">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The disparity between the rates of diagnostic and prognostic disclosure may be due to doctors’ reluctance to take responsibility for the potential risks, such as shock and depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312448940">11</xref></sup> but this does not mean that Japanese doctors believe that patients should be kept ignorant. A survey shows that doctors, caring for cancer patients, are more likely than patients to think that a “good death” includes knowing the length of time remaining or what is expected to happen in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395312448940">12</xref></sup> On the other hand, the 2002 survey of Tokyo residents showed that one out of four who wanted to know the cancer diagnosis did not want to know about expected recovery, or length of survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395312448940">13</xref></sup> Although doctors believe that it is better for the patients to know the truth, they are not quite sure which patients are ready to receive prognostic information.</p>
<p>While there are many quantitative studies that look for predictive factors for patients’ preference of information disclosure, it is impossible to exactly predict which patient wants to know what, based on socioeconomic backgrounds or cancer staging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312448940">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395312448940">15</xref></sup> There are also preferences for the type of prognostic information—some patients want a qualitative evaluation of fatality, while others prefer a quantitative estimate of remaining time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312448940">16</xref></sup> In order to provide appropriate information, we need qualitative research that allows us to understand patients’ perspectives on prognostic disclosure and emotional responses to such information.</p>
<p>In this paper, we analyzed qualitative interviews with breast cancer and prostate cancer patients in order to highlight patient accounts on the disclosure of life prognosis, their reasons for wanting or not wanting to know, and how that information is received and utilized by the patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1742395312448940" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The interviews were collected by three of the authors (RS, NI, AS) for the Database of Health and Illness Narratives (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dipex-j.org">http://www.dipex-j.org</ext-link>). In all, 42 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 49 men diagnosed with prostate cancer were interviewed between December 2007 and March 2009. Recruitment was based on purposive maximum variation sampling, guided by an expert advisory panel. The participants, all Japanese, were recruited from rural and urban areas all over the country. Medical institutions where patients were treated varied from privately owned clinics to national cancer research centers. Early and terminal stage patients were included in the sample. Demographic data of participants are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742395312448940">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Narrative interviews took place mostly in the homes of participants, and lasted 1 to 4 h. All interviews were audio-recorded and three-quarters were video-recorded. Participants gave informed consent to the use of their interview data for academic research and the online health information resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dipex-j.org">http://www.dipex-j.org</ext-link>). The interviews included two parts: first, interviewees were asked, “Can you tell me about your experience of cancer from the time you first noticed something unusual?” This question prompted uninterrupted narratives, which were largely chronological. The second part was a semi-structured interview.</p>
<p>After each interview, the recordings were transcribed. The authors read and re-read the data and constructed a coding frame, and then examined themes, across the whole data set, and in the context of each individual’s interview, in order to construct the online health information resource. Qualitative data analysis software, MAXqda 2007, was employed to facilitate the process. A qualitative interpretive approach combined thematic analysis with constant comparison.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312448940">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395312448940">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article is based on what Heaton calls an, “inside secondary analysis.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395312448940">19</xref></sup> RS, one of the members of the original research team, went through the entire data set for an additional coding, searching for references to life prognosis. An in-depth analysis was conducted in collaboration with other authors. While we did not specifically ask about prognostic disclosure, we extracted relevant narratives from the unstructured part of the interview and the semi-structured questions which included the kind of information received from medical professionals, the impact of having cancer on life plans, and fears or worries about the future.</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analyzed in Japanese, and then the extracts were translated into English by the first author for this article.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1742395312448940"><title>Communication of life prognosis by doctors</title>
<p>Only a minority of participants who talked about how the cancer diagnosis was given made references to how life prognosis was communicated by their doctors. This is partly due to the fact that we did not specifically ask them to discuss prognostic disclosure, but it also reflects the general tendency in Japan that doctors are less likely to communicate life prognosis even when they tell their patients about cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>Among those who discussed about the communication of life prognosis, some had voluntarily asked for the information and some were told without asking. One man was shocked to learn that he had “terminal-stage” prostate cancer, but he asked for prognostic information, so that he could “be responsible for his life.”<disp-quote>
<p>“Of course, the doctors will do their best to treat you, but in the end they can’t be responsible for your life. So whether you live or die, you have to understand what is happening to you in order to accept it. ….So I asked about my remaining time, and the doctor gave me the survival rate instead. He said that the two-year survival rate will be no more than 50% and that five-year rate would be less than 10% (PC6, age 60, stage D)”—(Quotations from the interviews are followed by participants’ identification code, age and cancer staging at the time of the interview. PC stands for prostate cancer and BC for breast cancer. Whitmore-Jewett staging is used for prostate cancer and the staging based on TNM classification is used for breast cancer. In cases in which participants did not mention the exact staging, it was estimated from their treatment and/or the accounts on the extent to which the cancer had spread).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although he was shocked by the news, he was able to cope, because he knew that he had “terminal-stage” cancer. He chose to learn more about the harsh reality in order to maintain control over his life. Another man who also asked for the prognosis was not as prepared.<disp-quote>
<p>The doctor in charge asked me, “Would you like to know the exact condition of your cancer?” I had no idea what was going on, so I said, “Yes, I do.” Then he said, “You've only got a few more months to live.” I said, “What did you say?” So he explained, “The cancer cells from the prostate have metastasized throughout your body.” At the time, I was dumbfounded. The shock was enormous. (PC28, age 71, stage D)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another man recalled how upset he was when the doctor suddenly brought up his 5-year survival rate without warning, as he explained the diagnosis.<disp-quote>
<p>He said something like, “Given your condition, the probability that you would be alive, let’s say 5 years from now, is about 70%.” I thought, “Why should I be told such information?” It’s not something definite. So I said to him, “I don’t see any reason that you must tell me that I have a 70% chance of surviving. …I know about myself and I can make my own decisions.” Then I never went back to that hospital again. (PC23, age 69, stage B or C)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although his condition was by no means “terminal,” he was strongly offended by such unilateral notification. He also could not recall any explanation about how the prognosis was made.</p>
<p>Some hospitals in Japan ask patients to complete a questionnaire at the first visit with their preference on diagnostic disclosure. One man was unsure if he wanted to know the diagnosis; he did not complete the questionnaire, but ended up receiving full disclosure of diagnosis and life prognosis.<disp-quote>
<p>When the results came back, the doctor said, “Since you haven’t answered this questionnaire, it is difficult for me to explain the results.” If everything was fine, he would not hesitate, but he said, “Because you didn’t answer, I can’t explain.” I thought, “Oh, it must be a bad news.” So I said, “Tell me whatever you find necessary.” The doctor said, “It’s prostate cancer, metastasized all over your body. It’s advanced, terminal cancer. Surgery is no longer a choice. Neither is radiotherapy nor chemotherapy. Eat whatever you like and enjoy the rest of your life. You’ve got six months to live.” (PC47, age 81, stage D)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This man was shocked, but at the time of the interview he had survived more than 7 years after receiving this news. The episode casts doubt on the wisdom of full disclosure, and also shows the difficulty of making accurate prognostic estimates for an individual patient. Perhaps because of this difficulty, some doctors are reluctant to give quantitative estimates, even upon request.<disp-quote>
<p>My doctor doesn’t like to use such words as, “expected length of survival.” He said, “In the old days, if the cancer had metastasized to your liver, you would expect only six months to live, but today there are many good anti-cancer drugs and there’s a new one coming out every year. So people with recurrent cancer are living much longer. Only God knows how long you can live.” (BC3, age 34, stage IV)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742395312448940"><title>Independently discovering life prognosis</title>
<p>Some participants talked about independently looking for information on life prognosis. Even when doctors did not directly discuss life prognosis, they gave information about cancer stage or extent of metastasis. With that information, some patients looked elsewhere for estimates on prognosis. For instance BC3, quoted above, whose doctor was unwilling to give her prognosis in figures such as life expectancy, used the Internet to find out her expected survival time.<disp-quote>
<p>Last year, when the cancer metastasized to the liver, I searched through the Internet and found statistics on the mortality rate of breast cancer patients who had metastasis to the liver. People who have liver metastasis have the poorest prognosis, you know. I guess they tend to have liver failure. I think the average survival rate [sic] was 13 months. I really panicked when I saw those statistics. (BC3, age 34, stage IV)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One man recalled his daily visits to a large bookstore, hoping to find a better prognosis—he called this behavior a “search for the blue bird of happiness” quoting from Maurice Maeterlinck’s 1908 play <italic>L'Oiseau</italic> bleu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312448940">20</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>When I looked into one of those books on the shelves, it said that my 5-year survival rate was something like 20 to 30%. … So I looked into another book hoping that the figure would show up differently. Let's say, like 50 to 60%, if possible 100%. …. I was desperate, I wanted some assurance, but since those books were written by experts computing the average from the past data, the figures were all the same. (PC10, age 61, stage C)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another man was frustrated by prognostic information found on the Internet, because it only provided survival rates for different cancer stages without taking the age factor into account.<disp-quote>
<p>I wish the doctors would tell me the future risks in terms of more precise percentages, but they never do. I guess it’s very difficult to do so. On the Internet, you see web pages with imprudent statements regarding average survival time or survival rates based on cancer stages, such as C or D, or the state of metastasis and lymph nodes, but it’s not that simple. Given that the majority of (prostate cancer) patients are elderly, I wonder how they calculate such figures. You should take into account that even those who are healthy may die in their seventies and eighties. I understand that making a prognosis is difficult, but sometimes I’m frustrated…. I know it’s an unreasonable demand, but I wish someone could give me concrete statistics, although I don’t know what I’d do with it (laughter). I still want to know. It’s complicated. (PC7, age 60, stage C)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Not everyone who knew the stage of their cancer, however, asked their doctors or independently sought out their life prognosis. For instance, another prostate cancer patient (PC3, age 58, stage D) knew that he had bone metastasis and was tempted to ask about expected length of survival, but he did not, “Since I have chosen to entrust my life to the doctor, getting such information would not make much difference.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1742395312448940"><title>Reasons for wanting to know the prognosis</title>
<p>One of our participants (PC6, age 60, stage D) talked about wanting to know prognostic information in order to remain responsible for his own life. Another talked about living fully with an awareness of limited time (PC25, age 70, stage B). Some said that the information was necessary to put personal affairs in order before death. “Many people lose their lives all of a sudden in traffic accidents. … I don't want to die in that way, because I’m the kind of person who likes to put things in order, you know. So I need a little time. If I only had a year to live, I want to be told so. And that's difficult unless you have cancer” (BC16, age 46, stage II). Another woman, who faced death within 5 years, rented a business-use shredder to dispose of all the personal documents which she did not want others to see (BC26, age 50, stage IV).</p>
<p>Others used the information to leave something behind for their family. A widowed woman, with extensive liver metastases, looked at the Internet and found that the median survival time was less than 11 months, so she wrote a so-called “ending note.” An ending note, recently popular in Japan, is a combination of personal memoir and a living will.<disp-quote>
<p>I started to think, “OK, since my husband is no longer here, I have to put things down in writing so that my children should not feel at a loss, when I'm gone. I'll create the so-called ending note.” Then I thought, “I should also leave the record of those happy days of raising my children.” There are things that children do not remember, you know, like things that happened before the age of three. There are lots of happy memories that children don't remember, and I'm the only one who does. (BC27, age 51, stage IV)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As PC7 quoted earlier, some said they wanted to know their life prognosis just for the sake of knowing. Some felt that not knowing when death would arrive was agonizing (BC24, age 50, stage II), but statistical estimates of life expectancy do not always help such patients to prepare themselves for the approaching death. For instance, one man, who said at one point that “it would be easier if we knew when death would arrive,” felt that his hope was partly taken away, when the doctor told him that if recurrence was to happen it would happen in five years and that patients with recurrent cancer would have three years to live.<disp-quote>
<p>You often hear that the awareness of limited life allows one to live better and more fully for the remaining days and to die without regret. But that is not so easy. Most people are living without thinking about their death or when they are going to die; mostly believing that their life is going to last indefinitely. That’s why they can maintain hope for the future, even if it may be an illusion. …So I can’t deny that my hope for life has been partly lost (by the prognostic disclosure). (PC1, age 52, stage C)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Sometimes people reported that supportive words from medical professionals had encouraged them to face the reality and take actions to make the best of remaining time, as in the case of a woman whose breast cancer had metastasized.<disp-quote>
<p>The doctor clearly stated that, “It’s difficult to expect complete recovery, once the cancer has recurred or metastasized.” And he added, “Please let us know how you would like to spend the rest of your life. We will try to enable you to live the way you want to live.” I was glad that he said it so straightforwardly, because I think it helped me clarify my wishes (to live the rest of my life as usual). (BC15, age 45, stage IV)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Hearing the doctor’s supportive words, she then asked for the expected survival time which turned out to be three years. She said that life prognosis was “not about death” but was necessary information in order to “maintain the status quo” of her current condition as long as possible. So she chose chemotherapy that did not induce hair loss.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1742395312448940"><title>Reasons for not wanting to know the prognosis</title>
<p>Some of the participants (PC38, age 77, stage C; PC49, age 85, stage B; BC41, age 72, stage IV) used the idiom “ignorance is bliss” to explain their reluctance to know their chances of survival. These were the people who wanted to lead the “life as usual,” without fear of death or losing hope as long as possible. This contrasts with the perspective of BC15, quoted above, who felt that she needed prognostic information to help her live “as usual.” This, however, was not the only reason for wanting to avoid prognostic information. Others (BC17, age 46, stage IV; PC30, age 72, stage B) said that they wanted to avoid what Merton called “self-fulfilling prophecy.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395312448940">18</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>If someone says that you’ve only got three months to live and once you believe it, you will die. …If you fill out the advance directives on how you want to die, it will soon come true. So you’d better fight with your doctor and keep a cheerful attitude. (PC30, age 72, stage B)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This fear of evil prophecy is supplemented by distrust in the accuracy of the prognosis given by medical professionals. Some believed that doctors gave an overly pessimistic forecast to “hedge the risk” of being blamed for an early death (PC1, age 52, stage C; PC5, age 59, stage C; PC23, age 69, stage B or C).<disp-quote>
<p>Since medical professionals have to deal with very different types of patients, they play it safe. So even when they think that a patient still has a year to live, they’d say 3 months or 6 months instead. If the patient lives 12 months, then he can say “good for you.” But when weak-minded people hear that they only have 3 months, they actually drop dead in 3 months, ‘cause they believe whatever the doctors say is right. (PC20, age 66, stage D)</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec8-1742395312448940"><title>Understanding quantitative prognosis</title>
<p>Median survival time and 5 (or 10)-year survival rate are the measures most commonly used by medical professionals to express life prognosis of cancer patients. Many of our interviewees, however, used a colloquial expression <italic>yomei</italic> (literally meaning “remaining life”) to talk about their life prognosis. While some of the participants used the term <italic>seizon-ritsu</italic> (survival rate) to discuss their prognosis, they were mostly quoting the term either from the doctor’s explanation or the prognostic information written in a book or a website. Only PC49, who was a doctor, used the term <italic>seizon-kikan</italic> (survival time).</p>
<p>Some of the participants seemed to misinterpret survival time as a kind of a “deadline.” One woman, who had been told that her expected survival time was three years, expressed her ambivalent feelings about having remained alive for seven years, in spite of her doctor’s prediction.<disp-quote>
<p>Some people can fall dead on time as the doctor tells you, but there are others who can't. What happens then? On the one hand, you feel that it's too difficult to live any longer, but on the other, you think that since you are given the chance to live, you've got to hang on to it. So you end up being torn between these two emotions. (BC30, age 54, stage IV)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>BC3 who found on the Internet that the survival time for patients with metastasis to the liver was 13 months was happy to have “outlived” the given time, although the figure she quoted was likely to be the median and not the maximum.<disp-quote>
<p>I have already survived over 13 months, so I have foiled the statistics in a positive sense. I had been on an emotional roller coaster with statistics and figures, but my boyfriend said “Forget about the stats. It's not about you. You never know how long you can live, but I want you to live for a long time.” I think he's right. You don't have to follow the stats like a textbook. (BC3, age 34, stage IV)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Since most lay people think of life prognosis in terms of time span,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312448940">14</xref></sup> prognosis given in the form of probability is even more likely to invite confusion. A man who had brachytherapy (PC39, age 77, stage B) believed that the doctor had told him that he had only 5 years to live, but given the treatment, it is likely that his cancer was locally confined, which suggests that his 5-year survival rate was over 90%. He may have misunderstood the doctor’s explanation of survival rate.</p>
<p>While some people felt helpless when they found that survival rates were very low (for instance, PC5 [age 59, stage C] talked about being devastated to hear that the 5-year survival rate was 20%), there were others who sought encouragement from the statistics even when the odds were against them. PC6 (age 60, stage D), shocked to know that the 5-year survival rate was 10%, quickly “switched (his) mental outlook to think that there were 10% of those who would survive” and started to figure out “the ways to become one of that 10%.” In some cases, the reinterpretation process was facilitated by medical professionals.<disp-quote>
<p>When the doctor told me about the stage of my cancer, she said, “Your cancer falls within this stage, but you know that there's a saying: ‘Fancy may kill or cure.’ If someone says that the 5-year survival rate for this stage is statistically 48%, you still can try to get into that 48%.” I perfectly agree. Yes, I really think so. It's a matter of how you interpret the term. (BC13, age 45, stage III)</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec9-1742395312448940" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Among the participants of this study, only a minority reported that they received information on life prognosis from their doctors. In several of those cases, patients were deeply shocked by the abrupt, unexpected disclosure of survival estimates. It was not only the terminal patients who were shocked to hear the prognosis; patients diagnosed with earlier stage cancer were also upset by a unilateral notification. While doctors can reduce the risk of “disclosure perils” by asking the patient whether or not he/she wants to know the life prognosis, it is possible that some of the patients asking for prognosis have limited insight as to how serious the condition is and may still end up feeling devastated. There is no reliable exclusion criterion to avoid the negative impact of prognostic communication.</p>
<p>There is a large body of literature on the communication of diagnosis and prognosis intended to help medical professionals who have to deal with this difficult task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312448940">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312448940">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395312448940">21</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395312448940">23</xref></sup> However, as some of our interviews demonstrate, medical professionals are no longer the only source of prognostic information. While only a minority had been told of life prognosis by their doctors, the large majority had been given diagnostic information on cancer stage or extent of metastasis, which enabled them to seek out prognostic information outside the doctor's office, in books and websites. A tacit understanding on the part of both doctors and patients that prognostic information could be found elsewhere may be one of the reasons why the patient–doctor communication tends to focus on the current status and stops short of discussing what will happen in the future.</p>
<p>Our interviews revealed that the consistent problem underlying the negative impact of prognostic disclosure was the absence of shared understanding between doctors and patients regarding its objective. For patients with advanced cancer, knowing their life prognosis can help them make the most of their remaining time and reduce the risk of having unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments. Even for early-stage cancer patients, prognostic information can be useful in choosing between different treatments. However, those who were shocked or upset by the prognosis did not seem to find the information useful, because they did not think that it was relevant to any kind of decision-making. Although prognostic disclosure is only a means to an end, communication of life expectancy often becomes an end in itself for medical professionals and patients become passive recipients of the information.</p>
<p>In an earlier paper on cancer disclosure in Japan, Elwyn and colleagues pointed out that knowledge of diagnosis in Japan “did not necessarily imply participation in the decision-making process.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395312448940">8</xref></sup> The authors argued that cancer disclosure in Japan in the 1990s meant disclosure only of the name of the disease and did not include “full information about prognosis and related considerations.” A similar problem was found in the accounts of prognostic disclosure in our study; it was often disclosure only of quantitative estimates of survival and did not include “related considerations,” such as implications for treatment choices and meaningful use of time.</p>
<p>This problem may also underlie the refusal of prognostic information due to the fear of self-fulfilling prophecy. Christakis found that some of the American physicians he interviewed feared that their prognosis could become self-fulfilling prophecy; i.e., their prediction on the progression of illness could affect patients’ and physicians’ attitudes or behaviors in a way that promoted the predicted outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395312448940">21</xref></sup> Some of our participants, on the other hand, feared that by believing the pessimistic prophecy made by physicians, they would contribute to their own “premature” (i.e. earlier than expected) death. The difference is interesting; whereas Christakis argued that physicians’ belief in the self-fulfilling prophecy strongly contributed to the “ritualization of optimism,” our participants indicated that there was ritualization of pessimism. They believed that physicians gave shorter survival time than their actual estimate, in order to avoid blame for patients dying before the predicted time. While there are no studies that suggest that Japanese physicians in fact provide overly pessimistic prognosis, the belief that they do seem to have a firm hold over a certain proportion of patients. This scepticism about the overly pessimistic prognosis is likely to be based on the notion that prognostic disclosure is not for the benefit of patients, but for the physicians’ self-protection.</p>
<p>The misconceptions regarding quantitative estimates of survival are also indicative of the unilateral nature of information communication. Previous studies have shown that a large majority of patients favor a qualitative prognosis over a quantitative one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312448940">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742395312448940">24</xref></sup> Doctors giving out quantitative estimates without asking what information the patient is looking for are likely to end up confusing the patient. However, even if doctors avoided giving out quantitative estimates, patients may eventually find survival rates or median survival times in books and websites, and some of them are likely to misunderstand their meaning. Thus, prognosis communication today requires the skill to find out what patients already know and what they understand, so that the doctor can also recommend other resources that would help the patient to gain more accurate understanding of the information.</p>
<p>A set of guidelines for communicating prognosis has been developed in Australia based on a qualitative analysis of interviews with both patients and health professionals and a large quantitative survey of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742395312448940">25</xref></sup> Primary themes of ideal content and style of information delivery identified in our study were similar to the findings of qualitative analysis conducted for the Australian guidelines: e.g., communication within a caring, trusting, long-term relationship; open and repeated negotiations for patient preferences for information; strategies to ensure patient understanding; and encouragement of hope and a sense of control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742395312448940">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The size and nature of our sample (patients with stable conditions, who could easily tolerate the interview) limits generalization to larger populations. Moreover, since the analysis was based on patients’ accounts, we only have one side of the story. In order to develop a set of effective guidelines on prognostic communication in Japan, we need additional studies involving qualitative studies of medical professionals as well as large quantitative studies on patient preference. While basic principles for open, trusting communication may be universal,<sup>27</sup> we should also pay attention to historical and cultural context in which the practice of prognosis disclosure developed; the absence of shared understanding regarding the objectives of prognostic disclosure and the patients’ scepticism toward prognostic information may be products of such historical underpinnings.</p>
<p>The phrase used by PC6 in the earlier quote, “in the end they (doctors) can’t be responsible for your life,” is indicative of the current situation in Japanese medicine. He may have used this phrase as a challenge to those patients who see their doctors as responsible in making decisions concerning one's life and death. Prognostic communication has become the focal point in understanding the nature of patient–doctor relationships in Japan today, because there is no consensus that the patient has the responsibility and authority to make treatment decisions. This study demonstrates the need to establish a communication style that empowers patients and encourages them to participate in the process of decision making.</p>
