<sec id="sec1-0952076711425982"><title>From lowest common denominator to highest common factor: How to make policy better</title>
<p>It is no surprise that lawyers are often very successful politicians: people who can turn their minds to any subject, make a case and move on to the next brief, without necessarily agonising too much on the merits. In law, we think the best results come from the battle of two stories, subject to the judgement of peers.</p>
<p>That may be the best way of resolving legal disputes or determining guilt (though a lot of continental Europe does it differently). It is far from clear that this is the best way of making policy. Yet our approach to policy making suffers from it being seen as an adversarial process – within government as departments battle for their budgets and their interests; between government and the more or less willing services and citizens – and sometimes between civil servants and Ministers.</p>
<p>This internal adversarial approach is compounded when the political dimension is added. There is a bit of a cliché to the critique of this aspect of government – there are nuances, and greater complexities galore – but it is useful for exploring the problems of policy-making. So, as the critique runs, the UK Parliament – with its “two tribes” layout – frames politics as an Oxford Union debate: those in favour of the motion ranged against those opposed, with no meeting ground between. We prize Ministers who claim certainty – and damn others as ditherers or weak. Changing your mind, even when the facts change, risks accusations of making a U-turn – the sign of a government on the back foot. Our shrill press passes instant judgments – with big, inflammatory headlines to shift copies and stand out in a highly competitive market place. Radio and TV interviewers see their role as compensating for the failure of the House of Commons to offer proper scrutiny and appear to operate under the assumption that all politicians are lying shysters out to hoodwink a gullible public.</p>
<p>Whatever the greater complexities in the explanation, the end result of this is that too often we end up with lowest common denominator policies; policies that people can live with but fall short of what might have been possible. We lack innovation, but at the same time see ideas launched before their time (and some launched that never should be). Issues fall between cracks or land in a too difficult box.</p>
<p>In my civil service career, I have been part of the process, both in the Treasury saying no (but also making tax policy) and in other departments, trying to deal with cross-cutting issues. What follows are personal reflections complemented by recent work Michael Hallsworth and I have done at the Institute for Government (IFG) as part of our <italic>Better Policy Making</italic> theme, and earlier work by the Institute on the role of the centre (<italic>Shaping Up</italic>) and on ministerial effectiveness (<italic>The Challenge of being a Minister</italic>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0952076711425982"><title>The policy making system</title>
<p>Some policies work, or at least achieve their objectives, without too many obvious downsides. Recently we have been exploring the factors behind some policies where governments have changed things: from privatisation to devolution to the minimum wage and the smoking ban. But more generally, when we asked Directors General two years ago what was worrying them, the quality of policy making was high on their agenda. This was despite the concerted efforts of the last decade to improve policy making.</p>
<p>Our research suggested that the problem with those reform attempts was not that they did not contain elements of common sense, but that they abstracted policy making too much from the “real world” – the system – within which political choices are made. They took no account of the internal incentives that policy makers both officials and Ministers face: the desire to make a mark during what may be a short tenure in a department; the desire to be at the centre of action; the need to show a “can do” attitude to get marked out for promotion; and the desire not to take risks and to avoid blame for things going wrong. But they also took no account of the external environment: no other departments, no opposition, no parliament, no media, no Europe – and thus no pressures to make the wrong decisions for the wrong reasons. It is hardly surprising that people saw a gap between the rational model they were taught and the reality of policy making.</p>
<p>Our report on <bold><italic>Making Policy Better</italic></bold> sets out changes that could embed better policy making in departments. Here I want to look at the changes we need to improve policy making across government and beyond: to enable us to see more “highest common factor” policy making.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0952076711425982"><title>The (un)importance of departments</title>
<p>Both politicians and civil servants are trapped in a defective system. Within government, one of the biggest problems is departmental silos; put more bluntly, the departmental basis of organising government. It is unclear why we allow this to determine so much of the way we transact government business.</p>
<p>Cabinet Ministers are allocated quite randomly to departments (and junior Ministers even more so). As my IFG colleagues Peter Riddell and Catherine Haddon have shown, there is a merry-go-round when the first Cabinet is appointed – even without the complication of coalition – with a third of Ministers changing portfolio. This is then compounded by frequent reshuffles. So a Minister like David Miliband can see himself moved from schools to the Cabinet Office, to working on local government, to environment, food and rural affairs, to foreign affairs over an eight year Ministerial career. His is not an extreme case; some of the utility Ministers, John Reid and Alan Johnson for instance, found themselves rotated through departments at a rate of knots. This all suggests that the departmental label is worn quite lightly by readily interchangeable Ministers.</p>
<p>Departments loom rather oddly in a civil service career as well, but in a different way. When I entered the fast stream, the initial allocation to departments seemed to be quite arbitrary and the decision, based on a very uninformed preference list, did not seem that important. The only big choice was whether to join the home civil service or the elite corps of very separate diplomatic service. There were no interviews with departments, nor any chance to appeal. Indeed many people did not get their first or second choice. And yet, the moment you joined, the department took ownership of you and your career. That still happens today, but has been reinforced by the development of separate terms and conditions which can act as a barrier to mobility between departments. The result is that most people spend most of their career in one or two departments (though if the department is reorganised, they may find themselves doing a job in the Business department one day and the same one in the Energy and Climate Change department the next).</p>
<p>At the top, rotation suddenly becomes a virtue. Indeed the revealed preference from the latest round of Permanent Secretary appointments, even with a set of relatively neophyte Ministers, was that being a “new broom” was a better qualification to take over at the top than longstanding experience or knowledge of a subject. But the personal Accounting Officer responsibility means that the one thing where Permanent Secretaries feel really on the line is value for money for their department's budget and often that is defined as meeting departmental, not government, objectives.</p>
<p><bold>The consequences: interdepartmental wrangling on some issues … </bold>This casual attitude toward departments would on the face of it suggest that joining up should be easy. After all, if a department can be tossed off like a pair of shoes, and another simply pulled on, this suggests they do not matter that much. But in practice it is very often the reverse. One of the first things new Ministers – and their Permanent Secretaries – feel obliged to prove is that they can prosecute their department's interests as effectively as their predecessor. This is where they act like lawyers. Being Home Secretary or Environment Secretary is their new brief and they need to show they can get to grips with it, fast. Therefore, too often they will be judged by how effectively they secure narrow departmental objectives rather than contribute to wider government goals. This causes particular problems with issues which require coordinated action by multiple departments.</p>
<p><bold>… but lack of challenge on others</bold> The way we organise our government depends on Ministers playing their departmental roles effectively. The key thing about an adversarial system is that the “truth” emerges through both sides presenting their best, uncompromising, cases. When I was in the Chief Secretary's office in the Treasury, we had a real problem with the 1987 spending review when the then Health Secretary, John Moore, treated his settlement as a chance to show off his Treasury credentials, rather than make sure that the health service had the funding it needed. Likewise, one of the problems with the Treasury's proactive policy role under Gordon Brown was that there was no questioning counterweight – as that role traditionally lies in the Treasury. When the Treasury changed sides of the table we lost an essential check in the system. It was like a case where only the prosecution turns up. It is also a reason why so much tax policy is done so badly because tax policy is traditionally made in a super-secretive way with results unveiled to Cabinet colleagues on Budget morning. In other cases, there may be little challenge to what is seen as a narrow departmental issue. If the Treasury is not fussed on money, other departments will not routinely challenge MoD's view on defence capabilities, nor the Department of Health's view on health reforms.</p>
<p><bold>… and not delivering government commitments</bold> Our system can also make it difficult to deliver commitments, even when they have the Prime Minister's name on them. When we set up the sustainable procurement task force with leading businessmen, to look at how to meet the Prime Minister's commitment to make the UK a leader in Europe in sustainable procurement, the businessmen on the task force could not understand why departments thought they could ignore a Prime Ministerial commitment. In their businesses that degree of insubordination would be a firing offence. The Cabinet Office could agree there was a problem, but offer little advice on how to get departments to comply. We only got some traction by getting a watchdog we created to name and shame non-compliant departments.</p>
<p><bold>… compounded by Parliament.</bold> Opposition and Parliament compound departmentalism. Shadows line up to accuse Ministers of making a poor fist of standing up for their department, briefed by the departmental “stakeholders”; committees reinforce departmental lines. Parliament could act as a counterweight. Instead it judges Ministers on how well they stand up to scrutiny of their departmental role – and that peer assessment is how politicians judge their own effectiveness. Only the Prime Minister answers for the government as a whole.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0952076711425982"><title>An alternative way of governing?</title>
<p>Just as there is another way of arriving at justice – the investigating judge system in continental Europe – so there could be a different way of organising government and making policy.</p>
<p>The last government tried three tactics to deal with what it diagnosed as a “lack of joining up”: the creation of cross-cutting units; the creation of central strategic capacity and delivery oversight; and the creation of joint Public Service Agreements. All failed to make a real lasting difference. Cross-cutting units fail when they lose Prime Ministerial interest – and find it hard to make inroads when they have to beg for scraps from other's budgets. The central strategic and delivery capacity could make a difference in the few areas of focus, but failed to change overall culture. Joint Public Service Agreements were still mired in the notion of a departmental lead; the performance pressure on the delivery partners (who also had their own PSAs to lead) was much less acute. The final attempt – the creation of the National Economic Council under Gordon Brown – did instil for a time a different way of approaching the economic crisis in 2008, but was much resented by the Treasury for its incursions into economic policy and it disappeared immediately post election.</p>
<p>The problem with all these changes is that they are sticking plasters on the problem. Joining up implies that the natural state of government is divided. But there is no real reason why departments should characterise this central aspect of government, and condition the behaviours of politicians and civil servants, in such a way. Ministers are currently very taken with the new insights generated by behavioural economics. In that interpretation, you can argue that the department is the “default” in the way in which we make policy. We have established powerful social “norms” around the departmental organisation of government. “Ego” is bound up with departmental success. In Cabinet, the fact that Ministers are all addressed by their departmental titles reinforces the expectation that they are there to represent their departmental interests and not in their own right.</p>
<p>The aim should be to move from lowest common denominator to highest common factor government. The starting point should be an emphasis on joint problem solving – whether within government or between government and others – with real efforts to understand what real problems are – not to organise them for departmental convenience.</p>
<p>Our expectations of Ministers and officials should be that they bring expertise and insight from their domains of responsibility – to help achieve best outcomes. More time needs to be spent by Ministers and officials together understanding what problem needs to be addressed, which means reversing the current Cabinet committee process which only kicks in when policies are worked up and looking for approval for announcement. The model of the Office of Climate Change, which produced a shared analysis for Ministers, so they could argue over policy not numbers, could be a starting point. In the same way, budgets should follow issues, not departments – to change the incentives to cooperate – and internal appraisal should value contribution to overall government objectives at least as highly as furthering departments own goals. Part of this has to be to create a more unified civil service, on common terms and conditions, with its prime loyalty to government, not department.</p>
<p>But this all implies that policy making still remains the preserve of Ministers and officials in private. Opening out policy making – to bring experts, practitioners, interested parties into policy making from the start – also enables a different approach. At the Institute for Government, we have been looking at examples of successful policy making and one characteristic of all the cases we have studied is how much they owed to external involvement in shaping the decisions. Whether it was civil society in the case of the Scottish Constitutional Convention; Lord Turner and his fellow Commissioners on the Pensions Commission; George Bain and the Low Pay Commission on the minimum wage; or the range of academics and bankers who helped the government design privatisation – all our examples show the benefits of avoiding “closed doors” policy making.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0952076711425982"><title>Policy making in coalition</title>
<p>Formal coalition should make it easier to “break the mould” of policy making. It introduces a new axis for negotiation which cuts across departmental lines and new machinery has been introduced to resolve coalition disputes.</p>
<p>The first thing that became clear is how long it took Whitehall to adjust to the demands of supporting the Lib Dem Ministers including Nick Clegg who were supposed to Coalition-proof policies as well as doing their day job. Departments are just not equipped to take a non-departmental view on issues.</p>
<p>Second, coalition that is working well could and should provide an impetus to widen and open out the policy process. But there is a real danger that it works in the other direction – and the coalition seems to have suffered from this in its infancy. Everyone agrees that there are better formal processes than before and better internal debate to resolve issues. That is healthy unless it turns into a European council style war of red lines, as the debate on the future of the health reforms appeared to do. If that debate is in public, the stakes are raised, with real time commentary on who wins and who loses. If it's in private, there is a real risk that the deal cannot be unpicked in the face of external criticism and the government gets locked into something unworkable. The political agreement needed to balance coalition interests, combined with the departmental deals that still need to be made, may mean we end up with policies that are much less than the sum of their parts, and which are hard to explain to anyone. The compromises and recompromises around higher education policy look like a case in point.</p>
<p>In its early days, the coalition won plaudits from overseas observers for not only the speed of the coalition agreement, but also the sense that, rather than produce a series of halfway houses, the negotiators had gone for a “best of both” approach. There is a danger that, now the first flush of enthusiasm and excitement has waned, we end up with issue by issue compromise. To avoid this, the Coalition Committee may need to take on a role as a quality assurance committee – to make sure what emerges is workable as well as politically acceptable. But more generally the government has an opportunity to use the fact of two parties working together in government to show that there can be a different way of working within government – more open, less adversarial and, ultimately, more effective.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0952076711425982" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For too long, the UK has given departments and “departmental” views too much importance in determining how policy is made. The rhetoric of the “new politics” needs to extend to “new” government – more collective, more open, less adversarial and capable of developing highest common factor policies rather than burdening us all with too many substandard deals. And there is a place where they might look to see a less department-ridden model in action: Scotland.</p></sec>
