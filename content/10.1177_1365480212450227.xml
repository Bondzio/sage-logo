<abstract>
<p>This article is an account of a project in Laos which aimed to support schools in evaluating and developing responsiveness to diversity in student populations. Teachers, students and members of the community were involved in review, evaluation and leadership of change to improve learning and participation for all school-aged members of the community, including changing school cultures in terms of curriculum and pedagogy and also access to learning for those previously marginalized within communities. The project (in nine primary schools) led to greater shared leadership, participation and voice prompted by self-evaluation. Analysis enabled greater understanding of the challenges and issues in working across cultures to effect sustainable organizational change. Spaces needed to be created at local levels for teachers to construct meaning and develop a sense of agency in making and owning changes in practice. This shifting of responsibility is crucial in order to build sustainable development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article reflects on the way in which approaches to community-based school improvement have been developed in the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, with a particular emphasis on the inclusive development of schools’ and teachers’ understanding of the concept of inclusion. Data were collected from nine schools involved in the Lao PDR Inclusive Education (IE) Project between 2004 and 2009. The project was co-ordinated by the Non-Government Organization (NGO) Save the Children Norway, in collaboration with local partners including the Ministry of Education. The article outlines some of the processes involved in establishing a school and community based self-evaluation approach, reflects on the school based learning which took place and also explores some of the implications of the findings for further work in this field.</p>
<p>The research findings also relate to the development of teacher identity at a local level and in particular the tensions involved in trying to apply concepts which have been generated through Western theories, to schools and teachers in South-East Asian contexts. We emphasize the term ‘contexts’ because assumptions can be made that there is such a thing as a singular culture or context that is applicable to a region or a country, within which teacher identity develops. Our research indicates that this is not a useful way of conceptualizing teacher identity and that there are significant differences between teachers from school to school within countries and regions, dependent on local cultural factors and influences.</p>
<p>Our position in writing this paper is that we combine the roles of researcher, project manager and project consultant. Peter Grimes was Project Consultant to the IE Project, Khomvanh Sayarath was Project Manager for Save the Children in Laos and Sithath Outhaithany led the Ministry of Education Inclusive Education Team. Our close involvement in the project development, enabled us to make connections between different aspects of the project and to present a detailed picture of the achievements and challenges we faced. Maintaining objectivity and criticality is always a challenge faced by participant researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1365480212450227">Sherman and Webb, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212450227">Ely et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1365480212450227">Altrichter et al., 2007</xref>) and, as in other recent writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1365480212450227">Grimes et al., 2011</xref>) we have been grateful to a wide range of colleagues who have acted as critical friends in both the project work and the writing process, challenging our assumptions and preconceptions and highlighting areas where our analysis needed further development and criticality.</p>
<p>Laos is a landlocked country in South-East Asia, bordering onto Thailand and Myanmar/Burma in the west, Cambodia in the south, China in the north and Vietnam in the east. There are 17 provinces and 141 districts with 49 indigenous, ethno-linguistic groups. Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in the world and also has the distinction of being the most bombed country in history, as a result of the Vietnam War. It is estimated that in excess of 266 million cluster bombs were dropped between 1967 and 1974 and that approximately 80 million of these remain unexploded.</p>
<p>The education system in Lao PDR has been described at greater length elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1365480212450227">Grimes, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1365480212450227">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1365480212450227">Grimes and Stevens, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1365480212450227">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1365480212450227">Grimes et al., 2011</xref>). It is grade-based with a primary national curriculum which relies on set text books. Children begin Primary School in Grade 1, at the age of 7 and complete at the end of Grade 5, when they are 11. There is a challenge in meeting Education for All (EFA) targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1365480212450227">UNESCO, 2008</xref>), such as universal enrolment in primary school by 2015 and improving literacy rates, and a growing awareness at policy level that schools need to develop more inclusive practices in order to ensure that as many children as possible are attending and achieving in school. Children identified as being most at risk of failing include girls, children from poor families, ethnic groups and those with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1365480212450227">UNESCO, 2010</xref>). The Lao IE Project was a national strategy, supported by Save the Children, to develop schools which could meet the needs of all children living in the local community. By 2009, it had grown to more than 500 schools with at least three schools in each district trained to support children with disabilities and other diverse needs. This article is based on evidence collected from nine of these schools over five years between 2004 and 2009.</p>

<title>Inclusive education and quality education</title>
<p>Historically, inclusion has tended to be viewed as an attempt to move away from segregated provision for disabled students to creating mainstream placements for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212450227">Rieser and Mason, 1992</xref>). Increasingly however, it has grown into a broader concept concerned with identifying and removing barriers to participation and achievement for all students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212450227">Booth and Ainscow, 2002</xref>). This view of inclusion underpinned the Index for Inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212450227">Booth and Ainscow, 2002</xref>), a school review framework which enabled schools to evaluate development through an inclusive lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1365480212450227">Corbett, 2001</xref>). This framework was used as a starting point in this project to support the development of self-evaluation materials for schools built around inclusive values such as equality, participation, enjoyment in school and achievement for all students.</p>
<p>The IE Project in Laos had a central focus on enabling learners with disabilities to have equal access to mainstream education but also focused on the importance of ensuring that all students were experiencing a ‘quality’ education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1365480212450227">UNESCO, 1994</xref>: 6) by fully participating and achieving in school. There are important parallels between the concepts of ‘inclusion’ and ‘quality education’ as they are both often rather loosely defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1365480212450227">Sayed, 1997</xref>). Sayed and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1365480212450227">Bunting, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212450227">Holt, 2000</xref>) argue that definitions of quality are driven by the values and beliefs which underpin education. The Salamanca Statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1365480212450227">UNESCO, 1994</xref>) emphasizes the importance of equality, rights and the contribution of inclusive practices to ‘combating discriminatory attitudes, creating welcoming communities . . . [and] . . . building an inclusive society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1365480212450227">UNESCO, 1994</xref>: 6). However, concepts of quality education have been partly shaped by the way in which elements within the international educational community have sought to measure it. It has been argued that ‘an <italic>economist</italic> view of education uses quantitative measurable outputs as a measure of quality, for example enrolment ratios and retention rates, . . . and cognitive achievement as measured in national or international tests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212450227">Barrett et al., 2006</xref>: 2). We argue that this is an approach which has become overriding within a policy setting which is effectively dominated by Education for All (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1365480212450227">UNESCO, 2008</xref>) and the EFA Fast Track Initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212450227">Buse, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1365480212450227">World Bank, 2008</xref>). Understanding the reality of life in schools, however, involves engagement with culture and community at a local level and, as we argue later in this article, this necessitates abandoning concepts which limit our understanding to national cultural stereotypes or reliance on national data sets.</p>
<p>Nguyen et al. make the point that in contexts such as south east Asia, the pressure exerted by international agendas such as EFA, through powerful international agencies, to reform education systems as quickly as possible, runs ‘. . . the risk of ‘‘false universalism’’ involving the relatively uncritical adoption of various western approaches’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1365480212450227">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>: 109). Non-government organizations such as Save the Children and agencies such as UNESCO and UNICEF have tended to advocate the adoption of a child-centred pedagogy in countries such as Lao PDR, perhaps without critically exploring the complex processes which enable changes in practice to develop sustainably. This has important implications for attempts to transform schools through a strategy of self-evaluation. This article acknowledges the problematic nature of these processes and highlights some of the tensions which have been inherent in the attempts to develop these in Lao PDR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1365480212450227">
<title>School self-evaluation: Inclusive school improvement</title>
<p>There has been a significant move towards greater self-evaluation of schools internationally over the last two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212450227">Macbeath and McGlynn, 2002</xref>) and this is tied to the ongoing debate about the most effective ways in which to evaluate school performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212450227">MacBeath (1999)</xref> suggested that schools should be encouraged and supported to improve and raise standards, through ‘critical self-evaluation’. In English schools this has most closely been linked to inspection frameworks with the inevitable emphasis on raising levels of achievement. For example, in the self-evaluation process instituted by the English Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) from 2004 to 2010, schools were expected to engage in in-depth, realistic and critical self-evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1365480212450227">Ofsted, 2005</xref>) in order to improve performance. In Laos, the motivation at a policy level was more closely linked to meeting Education for All targets through the development of quality education in schools which were trying to become more inclusive. This is a significant distinction to make, since it is important to acknowledge that the policy discourse in these countries was making clear links between the development of ‘child-centred pedagogy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1365480212450227">Hammarbeg, 1997</xref>) and increasing participation and achievement in schools. There was also an acknowledgement that this would require significant community involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212450227">Holdsworth, 2003</xref>). Whilst the development of school self-evaluation approaches in South-East Asian contexts is a relatively under-researched area, some studies on school improvement in developing country contexts have argued that it is important to develop school improvement initiatives which respond to local cultural contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1365480212450227">Scheerhens, 2001</xref>) and which aim to engage with parental expectations of school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1365480212450227">Peng et al., 2006</xref>). The project discussed in this article focused on the collaboration between teachers and the community at a local level in the design and implementation of self-evaluation processes based on inclusive principles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1365480212450227">
<title>Inclusive schools: Partnership with parents and the community</title>
<p>Much of the research concerning the way in which schools become inclusive has been undertaken in Western societies (Europe, North America, Australasia). A feature of the theories generated by this body of work indicates that inclusive schools will usually have good links with parents and the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1365480212450227">Dyson et al., 2002</xref>). Corbett argues that inclusive schools respond to the needs of their communities and describes the way in which teachers in the school ‘link both into community values and into their own internal value systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1365480212450227">2001</xref>: 35). In Australia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1365480212450227">Carrington and Robinson (2006)</xref> identify valuing and collaborating with parents and the broader community as one of four fundamental principles in building inclusive school communities. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212450227">Black-Hawkins et al. (2007)</xref> supports this argument, stressing the significance of not only working with parents and members of the wider community, but also acknowledging that teaching and learning ‘takes place within the context of human relationships’ (p. 31). Working closely with parents and community also demands that schools are responsive to the ‘emotional lives’ of the community. These writers argue that where emotions such as ‘fear, humiliation, failure, intolerance and anger, are ignored, then barriers to inclusion and achievement are strengthened’ (p. 31). Inclusive schools then appear to be ones which act on their own value systems through responding to the needs of the local community and building partnerships at a local level.</p>

<sec id="section5-1365480212450227">
<title>Developing inclusive self-evaluation in Lao PDR 2004–2007</title>
<p>The mid-term review of the Lao PDR Inclusive Education Project in May 2002, recommended the development of an assessment tool in schools which could also be used to improve the quality of educational provision. This suggestion led to the development of an inclusive school improvement and self-evaluation tool which was eventually published by Save the Children Norway (SCN) as ‘Developing Quality Schools for All – a school improvement and self evaluation process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1365480212450227">SCN, 2007</xref>). The development of the tool needs to be understood in the context of growing understanding about the importance of school improvement processes in Lao. It had become clear to those working within the project at both Ministry and Project management level, that in order to bring about sustainable changes in the quality of education being provided, schools needed to be more involved in developing their own practice. It was believed that a self-evaluation approach based upon the Index for Inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212450227">Booth and Ainscow, 2002</xref>) would help to support the development of motivated and engaged teachers working together with local communities to bring deep rooted changes in practice. Up until this point, policy drivers had been seen as the main tool in initiating changes in practice, through training courses. This had had only partial impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212450227">Holdsworth, 2003</xref>) partly because there was limited understanding of the importance of developing teacher agency in sustaining school level change. It was hoped that this new project would put teachers at the heart of educational development.</p>
<p>A project management team was created comprising colleagues from the NGO, Ministry of Education, local advisors and an external consultant. It was decided that the most useful approach would be to develop quality indicators of inclusive practice in schools, as a framework for the evaluation of developments in school practice in order to set priorities for future school improvement. The aims of the programme were:</p>
<list id="list1-1365480212450227" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To initiate a pilot project comprising nine schools from three provinces; in each province there would be one district with three schools.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To produce materials, relevant to the Lao context but reflecting inclusive principles, which could be used by schools as a self-evaluation tool for assessing the quality of their provision for all students.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To develop school improvement action plans in each school with priorities based on analysis of consultation with all stakeholders in the school community.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To develop the capacity of district advisory teams to support and monitor the school improvement process.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To develop the capacity of clusters of schools to work collaboratively to develop inclusive quality educational provision in their respective schools.</p></list-item></list>
<p>One of the central factors that shaped the development of these aims was capacity building at local level, developing expertise and collaborative working practices at Ministry, Provincial and District Advisory level, as well as in schools. The benefits of developing collaborative networking practices are well noted in school improvement literature (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1365480212450227">Durrant and Holden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1365480212450227">Stoll and Fink, 1989</xref>). The Ministry of Education in Lao PDR had already introduced the idea of clusters of schools working together and this was incorporated into the school improvement project. The idea was that the three schools in each district would be able to collaborate throughout the piloting process, supporting each other and perhaps beginning to work as ‘critical friends’ – challenging and also supporting each other in order to refine and develop practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212450227">MacBeath, 1999</xref>). This also relates to the development of the role of the district advisors. The school improvement project was an opportunity to shift the advisory role from one of monitoring local schools to one based on collaborative working partnerships and ‘critical friendship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1365480212450227">Swaffield, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The materials were to be developed with the aim of rolling them out through a staged process to schools across the country. The teachers, principals and advisors who were invited to be a part of the development process were seen as full partners in the writing of the materials. Their role was identified by the management team as crucial to the project’s success. If the materials were to be credible and applicable in Lao schools they needed to be developed by practitioners who understood the practical context within which they would be used. Therefore, once the trialling process began there were two evaluations taking place: the self evaluation process in the schools and the evaluation of the materials themselves. The evaluation of the materials and processes undertaken by the schools was managed by the authors of this article and the Ministry of Education and involved a series of visits to each school over the course of the project as well as working closely with the advisors and teachers during regular workshops. On average, each school was visited between three and five times and attended approximately 12 workshops. School visits involved classroom observations and interviews with all stakeholders to identify ways in which the schools were applying the materials and processes. Workshops focused on reviewing and developing materials and gathering data from the participants about their perspective of the challenges they were facing and the progress they felt they were making.</p>
<p>The three districts in three provinces chosen were Kham in Xiengkhouang, Thoulakhom in Vientiane and Phonthong in Champasack province. The provinces were chosen to provide a broad sample of the geographical regions of Lao: Kham in the north-east, more mountainous with a diversity of ethnic groups and rural communities; Thoulakhom in the middle of the country close to the capital city Vientiane, with a local community comprising business people as well as rural farmers; Phonthong in the south close to the Thai and Cambodian borders, a community made up of rural, business people and also government workers. Each district was asked to choose three IE schools with the criteria that there should be a ‘stronger, a weaker and an average’ school. It was left to the district team to select the schools and they interpreted the criteria in different ways. In one district, weaker meant a school with weak practice, poor leadership from the principal and low grade results. In another district, weak was interpreted as a school in the economically poorest area of the district with few community resources to support the school. In the third district, weak was interpreted as a school that was new to the inclusive education project. In retrospect, this variation in the way the criteria for selection were interpreted gave the project a peculiar strength, in that the nine schools chosen had many different features which allowed for greater depth to the evaluation of the project materials in practice. It also created challenges in that at least two of the schools had relatively inexperienced school principals and teachers who had not had much experience of inclusive education. In these schools, the project team found that they had to offer higher levels of support in order to ensure that the school could participate effectively.</p>
<p>Each school was asked to create a coordinating team who attended the workshops and with the aim of coordinating the self-evaluation process in the school. In most schools this team comprised the principal and two teachers. The school coordinating team were supported by two district education advisors and two provincial education service advisors who also attended the workshops. By engaging with this process of self-assessment in schools, it was hoped that advisors would be able to develop their understanding of the role of a critical friend in order to support their monitoring and advisory work in schools as well as using their experience in supporting the development of collaborative networking between the three schools as a basis to develop similar approaches with other clusters within the district.</p>

<sec id="section6-1365480212450227">
<title>Indicators of inclusive development</title>
<p>As with the original Index for Inclusion, at the heart of the Lao self-evaluation tool were the indicators of inclusive development. Indicators are statements of aspiration against which existing practice in the school can be compared in order to set priorities for school development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212450227">Booth and Ainscow, 2002</xref>). Each indicator reflects an important aspect of the school community and is clarified by a set of questions which help to define its meaning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212450227">Booth and Ainscow (2002)</xref> argue that engaging in discussion about the meaning of each indicator and how it relates to current practice in the school is a very valuable aspect of the self-evaluation process. It is during discussions with teachers, students and parents that a school coordination team might begin to think about the priorities for school development.</p>
<p>The Lao indicators were initially developed over several months with a wider team than those who took part in the detailed design of the tool. In order to incorporate the perspectives of as wide a group as possible, advisors from all 17 provinces in Lao attended workshops in July and September 2004 to begin work on creating the indicators – before the pilot schools and advisors became involved in January 2005. The decision was taken not to translate the Index for Inclusion into Lao and use this as the basis for the Lao tool. This had been the case in several other countries. However, as noted above, the aim was to produce a tool that was relevant, practical and usable in a Lao context. The Index for Inclusion was originally produced for use in British schools, operating in a particular context, much of which was not applicable to Lao PDR. This must be recognized when adapting the Index for use in different cultures and country contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1365480212450227">Booth and Black-Hawkins, 2001</xref>). The indicators that were finally developed, after much discussion, were written in the Lao language, without the original Index indicators being used as a model, and then translated back into English.</p>
<p>From this perspective, it is interesting to note that there were similarities between the two sets, which deserve further critical analysis beyond the scope of this article. It could be argued that teachers in different cultural contexts have some similar notions regarding the challenges that face them in developing more inclusive practice in their classrooms. Another interpretation might be that the policy discourse which became prevalent in Lao, had its roots in the same international policy initiatives which also informed the development of the original Index for Inclusion, that is, Convention on the Rights of The Child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212450227">UN, 1989</xref>), the Salamanca Statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1365480212450227">UNESCO, 1994</xref>) and Education for All (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1365480212450227">UNESCO, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to help clarify and understand the meaning of the indicators, each one also had a series of questions designed to stimulate discussion and offer guidance. All the indicators and questions produced can be accessed in ‘A Quality Education for All: the history of the IE project in Lao PDR’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1365480212450227">Grimes, 2009</xref>) which is available as a free download from a variety of websites (e.g. EENET) and provides more detail about the different aspects of the Inclusive Education Project in Laos.</p>
<p>The process was broken down into five stages of self-evaluation and school development, reflecting those set out in the Index for Inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212450227">Booth and Ainscow, 2002</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-1365480212450227">
<title>Stage 1: Finding out about the school</title>
<p>The school coordination team employed a range of data collection methods, including questionnaires, interviews and discussion groups, to collect the views of different members of the school community about the areas of success in the school and also those which needed to be developed. The indicators were used as a focus for the data collection. In each school, the coordination team were encouraged to discuss the different activities available, guided by a district education advisor. The advisors were encouraged to facilitate collaborative working practices between the three schools in their district.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1365480212450227">
<title>Stage 2: Identifying areas which need to be developed</title>
<p>Once the school coordination team had collected information from the different members of the school community, they then needed to analyse it. Gradually each school was able to identify a series of areas where the school appeared to be doing well and others where it might be able to improve.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1365480212450227">
<title>Stage 3: Prioritizing areas for development</title>
<p>School teams were encouraged to identify three to five priorities with at least one of these linked to teaching and learning, one to the development of the school environment and a third which could be open for the school to choose.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1365480212450227">
<title>Stage 4: Implementing priorities</title>
<p>After identifying the priorities, schools then needed to begin implementation, supported by advisors and other schools in planning what they would do. At this stage schools were shown ways of drawing up an action plan to provide details of:</p>
<list id="list2-1365480212450227" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the development priority chosen</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>which indicators it was linked to</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>action the school needed to take – what changes needed to be made?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>who would be responsible for implementation?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>who would be responsible for monitoring?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>how long would it take?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>how would it be evaluated/success criteria?</p></list-item></list>
<p>At this stage, work was undertaken with teachers, to try and develop reflective practice, to think honestly about their own practice in the classroom and to try to identify areas where they wanted to make changes or improve. One tool for this was to place emphasis on sharing practice with colleagues. It was hoped that by encouraging open discussion and sharing successes as well as challenges, teachers would recognize the capacity for learning from each other. Advisors were encouraged to support schools in identifying times for teachers to plan and discuss together and to observe each other teaching not only in their own school but also with colleagues in the local cluster schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1365480212450227">
<title>Stage 5: Reviewing the success of the improvement process</title>
<p>By setting clear criteria for success for each priority, it was hoped that the school coordination team might be able to make a clear judgement about how successful it had been in meeting its priorities. These judgements could then be shared with the wider school community through discussions with teachers, with students in classrooms and with parents in review meetings. It was emphasized by the project team that different members of the school community might have varying perspectives on whether priorities had been achieved or not. It was also expected that most schools would discover that some priorities were easier to meet than others. In most cases schools were expected to achieve some priorities and continue to work on others. Where priorities had been achieved, the school were asked to continue monitoring these areas and choose new priorities to take their place. In this way the self-evaluation and school development process would begin its second year and a new cycle.</p>
<p>At the end of the school year, after a full cycle of self-evaluation, each school was expected to prepare a report on their successes and areas for continued development. This would be shared with the whole school community and the local district advisor. Sharing findings with all stakeholders in the school was seen to be a fundamental part of the self-evaluation process whereby all teachers, parents and children needed to be involved in a dialogue about the success of the school improvement process, discussing the findings of the report and deciding as a school community how to try and improve further in the coming year. It was also hoped that the local district advisor would be able to use the school’s self-evaluation as a framework for assessing how successful the school had been. One aim was that they would be able to have a deeper and more analytical discussion with the school because of the self-evaluation and school development process, supported by improved data collection and analysis of student performance statistics, attendance rates, dropout rates and grade repeat rates. This process might appear to share some similarities with the Ofsted framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1365480212450227">Ofsted, 2005</xref>) in England and Wales between 2005 and 2010. However, the key differences were that the process in Laos was based on inclusive values and therefore emphasized the importance of collaboration and a developmental process of improvement rather than Ofsted making performance-related judgements and categorizing schools within a narrow framework essentially driven by a politicized standards agenda.</p>

<title>Findings: The experience of the nine pilot schools in Lao PDR</title>
<p>The data presented in the next section are drawn from the project teams’ visits to schools during the project period (2004–2007), data gathered from project participants in workshops and the evaluation of the IE Project between 2008 and 2009.</p>
<sec id="section13-1365480212450227">
<title>Comparison with the Index for Inclusion</title>
<p>In relation to the practicalities of working in Lao schools, it was found that there are professional development and cultural challenges when introducing concepts such as ‘self-evaluation’, ‘school improvement’ and complex materials such as a self-evaluation tool, to teachers who may have had little initial training. The original Index for Inclusion has 44 indicators – the Lao version has 17. In the original index, each indicator has between eight and 17 clarifying questions to support their use and stimulate discussion and enquiry – the Lao version has between six and eight questions for each indicator. The teachers and advisors felt it was important that the tool that was produced was ‘manageable’. It had to be sufficient to cover the issues relevant in Lao schools but compact enough for schools to feel that they could manage it. The concepts behind the tool had to be clear enough that their meaning transferred across cultures. Also the participants being introduced to the materials in their schools had to be clear about the purpose of the evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1365480212450227">Ebbutt, 1998</xref>): this was a <italic>self-</italic>evaluation and not an external one. The project team, all 57 advisors and teachers, made these decisions about the adaptation of the Index and the development of the tool together and there was an acknowledgement that it was a new process which would involve learning together. As one deputy-principal said:<disp-quote>
<p>We can only do our best – we work together on this and that makes it strong. Sure we will make some mistakes but we hope it is going to work in the schools.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This comment reflected the views of many of the participants in the project. It felt different from other initiatives which had been introduced before whereby specific child centred pedagogical approaches had been ‘taught’ to teachers by consultants in workshops. There had been an assumption that showing teachers ‘how’ to change practice, would result in changes. The self-evaluation process was asking the teachers to start from a different place. On one level this resulted in responses such as the one above – implying ‘this is new, we will do our best; we hope it will lead to positive changes’. It also raised critical issues on a deeper level. The theories underpinning the project reflected predominantly Western perspectives on school development and professional learning. In a country such as Lao PDR where there are competing cultural factors ranging from Animism to Buddhism, Confucianism to a one party political state, as well as relatively undeveloped professional structures within education, there are likely to be tensions in perspectives and understanding. These require consultants, project managers and researchers to question existing assumptions about the way in which teachers learn and develop their professional identity.</p>
<p>Evidence of the potential for confusion can be seen in some of the issues which arose during the pilot project in Laos. One example is the way in which, when designing data collection tools, the teachers and advisors found it difficult to move beyond the use of questionnaires to gather the perspectives of the school community. Lengthy questionnaires were developed for use with students, teachers and parents which proved difficult to use in practice, and led to the collection of large amounts of data which were too challenging for schools to analyse unaided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1365480212450227">
<title>Encouraging openness and honesty</title>
<p>The project team had also made a number of assumptions about the way in which schools could begin discussion groups with the local community. This was partly linked to the development of reflective practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1365480212450227">Stephens (2007)</xref> has identified a number of factors which may be challenging in developing reflexivity in Laos including the aforementioned political context where support and discussion is often interpreted as monitoring, which in turn is viewed as a form of political control. Discussion groups amongst teachers and teachers/parents took time to develop and attention had to be paid to openness, honesty and trust. It appeared that as parents and community representatives who were invited to meetings at the schools, became accustomed to the fact that the school and advisors really did want them to share their opinions, and that there was no expectation of a ‘correct’ answer to questions, they became more able to speak openly. During the first year of the project, there were several instances of parents and members of the local community making clear suggestions about how the school could be improved or, in one case, complaining about the principal. This seemed to confirm that it was possible to encourage local people to share their views but that it was likely to take time to establish the correct conditions.</p>
<p>Therefore those involved in collecting data in such contexts would need to be constantly vigilant concerning ethical protocols. This was an issue which was discussed throughout the project. Ideally, school teams would be able to set out a clear protocol for the ethical collection of data. However, this involved them in making complex political judgements about both themselves and the respondents and they found this challenging. For example, the issue noted above concerning speaking openly in meetings, required teachers to be honest themselves, regarding the political levers affecting parents speaking honestly. In some cases, teachers had a sophisticated understanding of this process and were able to discuss the ethical issues with others on the project team. In other cases there was relatively poor understanding of these issues and we had concerns about the extent to which some schools had collected data from parents in an ethically appropriate way. It seemed likely that in some cases parents may not have clearly understood the purpose of the data collection process and that not enough time was spent developing a trusting and collaborative relationship with them so that they felt safe enough to voice their real views.</p>
<p>In the very early stages of the project it was sometimes difficult to see very much evidence of open dialogue. This was particularly difficult for Peter, as the Western consultant, who was often reminded by Khomvanh, Sitath and other Lao colleagues that the process was very new to the participants and that he should not expect too much too quickly. As we worked with groups of students and parents and observed the teachers and advisors doing the same, the impression was often that there was little dialogue between the different groups. However, as we visited the schools in the project, we began to understand some of the contextual and cultural factors which were affecting the way in which schools were consulting parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1365480212450227">
<title>Understanding the significance of local context: ‘It’s better than catching frogs’</title>
<p>In the workshops we had designed materials which were to be used to consult the views of parents and community members. Therefore, we had assumed that the school was sending out general invitations to parents to attend consultation meetings. After observing and participating in several of these consultation meetings in different schools, we started to realize that the participants were mostly local village committee members. This would usually include the head of the village, his or her deputy and several other prominent and high status figures such as the representative of the Laos Women’s Union. In some instances where the school served several villages, each village head and deputy would attend. These were all participants who were used to working on committees and in meetings in a particular style, used to making themselves ‘heard’ and often with a particular agenda to defend or put forward. For example, it was part of the village committee’s responsibilities to liaise and work closely with the school principal. What had appeared to be a representation of parents was often, in reality, a ‘snapshot’ of local politicians in action.</p>
<p>This led to a review of the way in which the schools in the project consulted with parents and community. We tried to encourage the schools to invite and encourage the attendance of a wider range of parents, including those from disadvantaged groups and parents of those with disabilities. Subsequent discussions enabled us to appreciate the impact of aid agencies, NGOs and the Ministry in implementing policies such as Education For All (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1365480212450227">UNESCO, 1990</xref>). It also helped us to clarify the complexity of the processes we were engaged in together. The assumption that schools would automatically invite a range of parents was not a shared one. Furthermore, it raised the question of how the democratic ideals driving the project, as we imagined them, were being interpreted by schools. We understood from this, that certain concepts were not as transferable as we had thought. This included concepts which to us appeared reasonably simple and straightforward, such as the notion that if we were to talk to a group of parents then those parents should be broadly representative of the parent community.</p>
<p>Where dialogue was established it gradually became clear that meaning and interpretation was being constructed at a local level and did not necessarily conform to any sense of national cultural stereotypes. Once we began to get ‘real’ parents attending consultation meetings, we began to appreciate another set of constraints to our assumptions about the transferability of inclusive concepts. The parents who came to consultation meetings in Laos were not used to being asked what they thought and we observed that any questions about ‘inclusivity’ or ‘quality’ were very challenging for them to answer. The project had to develop starting points which were based on simpler questions than the ones we had initially expected the schools to explore. For example, a question such as ‘What do you think is good about this school?’ usually elicited little response from parents. We had to use questions such as ‘Do your children like coming to school?’ and ‘What sorts of things do they like to do in school?’ Whilst we did get responses it soon became clear that many parents did not really know what went on in school and did not have conversations with their children about school or learning. Education was seen as something which was ‘done’ by the school. Parents mostly appeared grateful that the children were able to attend a school and to be ‘learning’. This is perhaps typified by the response from the grandmother who came to a parents’ consultation in Champasack, in the south of Laos in November 2005:<disp-quote>
<p>Peter: Do your grandchildren enjoy coming to school?</p>
<p>Grandmother: Oh yes, of course they do.</p>
<p>Peter: Why is that?</p>
<p>Grandmother: Well it’s better than catching frogs isn’t it?</p>
<attrib>(Peter’s field notes, 2005)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This was the first time we had heard such a response and when we shared this with our Lao colleagues in the project team they were also very interested in the perspective being offered. After some discussion with both parents and local teachers and advisors, we were able to establish that some children in this particular district, if they didn’t go to school, would be sent into the fields to work or catch food – in this instance, frogs. Incidents such as this highlighted that the way in which reality is interpreted by individuals at a local level may differ greatly from not only the interpretations of a Western consultant, but also from those of colleagues in a national NGO.</p>
<p>Parents were not used to being asked what they thought about the school and the same was true of the children. However, the longer we worked with the schools, there was greater opportunity to talk with participants in a variety of different contexts and to understand the issues from a range of different perspectives. As we did so, Peter, in particular, as an outsider to Laos culture, realized that he had been viewing the process from a perspective which only recognized that which was familiar. In reality there was a great deal of dialogue between the different members of the school community but it was simply taking place in a form which he did not recognize. In some schools, there was a poor relationship between school and parents and the parents who met members of the project team during visits took the opportunity to complain that the principal did not meet with the parents or the local community members. In other schools, parents reported that they felt the school communicated with them well and that they knew if, for example, their child was not achieving as expected in school. There were in reality a set of structures for parent-school-community partnership working which were facilitated by the socio-political structure. For example, schools and local committees had a political responsibility to plan and collaborate to support both the school and also the local village. This might take the form of the village and school working together to raise funds to buy new equipment or to patrol the school at night to make sure it was not broken into. Children were expected to keep the school grounds tidy and clean and it was during these cleaning periods each day that we observed a significant amount of interaction between teachers and children, which was of a different nature to that observed in the classrooms. We also learned to appreciate that the local context and culture could differ greatly between villages, even within the same province. This affected the ways in which schools and communities learned to work together. The significance of the phrase, ‘it’s better than catching frogs’ can only be understood with a detailed knowledge of the local context in that particular area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1365480212450227">
<title>Positive outcomes</title>
<p>Despite the challenges, there was also evidence of positive outcomes in all nine schools. During visits to each school to evaluate the impact of the pilot, the project management team found that all the schools had action plans in place with clear priorities for development, related to indicators from the self-evaluation tool. In each school, at least one of the priorities related to teachers’ classroom practice and the quality of teaching and learning. There was also clear evidence in all schools that they had been actively working to improve their practice in the priority areas. It was noted that the greatest improvements occurred in schools where there had been close collaboration between the school co-ordination team and the rest of the staff, so that a sense of ownership of the school improvement process had developed. In successful examples, this tended to be supported by local district advisors working closely alongside the teachers. The greatest improvement occurred in the school which was originally identified as the weakest school in the project. The project had acted as a lever for change in the school enabling stronger more experienced staff to focus on developing more effective classroom practice throughout the school by supporting weaker or less experienced colleagues. In this school the project had enabled the development of close community links where none had existed before and this was identified by both teachers and parents as the most significant outcome of the project. This partly reflects findings from research into similar projects in England (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1365480212450227">Ainscow et al., 2006</xref>) whereby schools have been able to make significant progress in developing collaborative and inclusive relationships with the community and other schools, when this has been facilitated through an approach based on inclusive values. In this case, the significance of the project team’s understanding of the importance of local context in influencing this development cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>In some schools there was evidence that the school coordination team had engaged in detailed analysis of data such as grade results, dropout rates, enrolment, etc., and had used this to identify those students most vulnerable to school failure. One interesting aspect of this was the creative way in which schools had approached strategic action. For example, in one school where achievement in Grade 3 was a cause for concern, detailed data analysis indicated that a substantial number of those performing at levels below average came from a particular village. Discussions with students and villagers revealed that there was an issue around learning support at home. A strategic plan was drawn up with the local community to pilot the development of study groups at home supported by older brothers and sisters and some of the literate community members. This led to improved performance by all students taking part and the school then began to plan extension of the scheme to other villages. The significant aspect of this example, seemed to be that the school felt enabled to make decisions for themselves; they were enabled to respond locally to issues which they had identified themselves.</p>
<p>To conclude this discussion, the words of one of the participants, a deputy principal, seem to summarize the views of many:<disp-quote>
<p>We had to acknowledge in our school that there were some things we had to improve. We know things aren’t perfect – some things we can’t change, like the buildings; but we could think about our teaching and how we work with the children and the parents. We know we haven’t always tried to include everybody in discussions about the school and that’s not good enough. We have really made a difference this year – the school is a different place; a better place for children and teachers to learn in together. (Deputy principal, Pakse Province, Lao PDR)</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article we have attempted to explore some of the findings which have emerged from the introduction of a self-evaluation/school improvement approach in Lao PDR. Some of our findings seem clear: if theories of this kind are to be applied to non-Western settings, certain assumptions need to be challenged. Many of the concepts are new to teachers and officials in South-East Asia and some of the processes may be challenging on a number of different levels, including politically. There must be strategic planning and partnership working with development agencies and the Ministry of Education, through to local advisors and school based level or it seems likely that many participants will remain unconvinced or confused about the way in which self-evaluation is supposed to work. In addition, it should be recognized that there are a variety of factors rooted in the local context which can impact on the way in which local actors are able to engage with and make sense of new initiatives. Policy initiatives designed to support the development of more inclusive schools and introduce new ways of working in schools, must allow for the creation of space at local levels for meanings to be constructed which will support teachers in developing their own sense of agency and making changes in their practice of which they have ownership. Where this can be achieved, given time and collaboration it appears that this grassroots approach may have a positive impact on the sustainable development of quality inclusive education. Perhaps one of the most revealing pieces of evidence to emerge from the Laos project was that following the pilot project ending in 2007, reorganization of the Ministry of Education meant that the project was not systematically introduced to new areas of the country. However, without funding or centralized support from either the Ministry or NGOs, two of the three provinces who participated in the pilot project continued to introduce the tool to different schools, using it as a vehicle for community/school partnership working, and introducing local learning networks. They saw the project as a way of supporting teachers to develop their own practice in an inclusive way which responded to student diversity. Whilst it is clearly a problematic approach, self-evaluation appears to offer some positive ways forward to those countries seeking to find sustainable ways to develop inclusive schools, and one which can help to enable quality education for all children in the local community.</p>
