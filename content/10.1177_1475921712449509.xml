<p>Cracks are one of the primary forms of damage that can lead to the catastrophic failure of metallic structures. This study focuses on the application of epoxy nanocomposite thin film sensors for continuous monitoring of crack evolution in metallic structures. The core approach was to monitor the current (or resistance) change in these nanocomposite films, as cracks develop and propagate in the metallic host structure. Based on optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of epoxy resins modified with different contents of single-walled carbon nanotubes, two different nanocomposites (with 0.3 and 1.0 wt%) were chosen for the development of a crack sensor. The performance of the nanocomposite sensors was evaluated under tension–tension fatigue tests, on aluminum coupons with centrally located through thickness electrical discharge machining notches. Crack growth in the aluminum was found to transfer to the nanocomposite films in a stable mode. Once the crack was established, a linear correlation was found between the measured current and crack length with a slope of −10<sup>−11</sup> and −10<sup>−8</sup> A/mm for 0.3 and 1.0 wt% nanocomposites, respectively. Contact between the asperities formed on the crack surfaces in the nanocomposite film while the crack was closed at small loads (&lt;30% of maximum load) was found to be an important limiting factor causing a large variation in measured currents during each fatigue cycle. Hence, a normalized variable based upon current change during each cycle was defined, providing a more accurate measurement of the crack size, with a crack gauge factor of ∼0.04 mm<sup>−1</sup>. In summary, the nanocomposite thin film sensor developed in this study offers both continuous crack growth monitoring and the possibility of strain sensing. The sensor is also suitable for visual inspection of the host structure due to the transparency of the developed nanocomposite film.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metallic structures are generally susceptible to failure in fatigue loading due to crack formation and propagation. Monitoring and assessing the evolution of such cracks in these structures could prevent costly and catastrophic failures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475921712449509">1</xref></sup> Currently, structural health monitoring (SHM) approaches that rely on the detection and monitoring of cracks employ complicated, unreliable systems, and often have unproven performance in the desired operational environment. Hence, there is a need to develop SHM techniques and systems that are reliable, autonomous, and practical for implementation in real situations.</p>
<p>Sensors capable of detecting surface cracks have already been developed. As example of this is the comparative vacuum monitoring (CVM) technology, which consists of a silicon rubber sensor with a series of capillary tubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475921712449509">2</xref></sup> maintained alternately at atmospheric pressure and low vacuum, referred to as air and vacuum galleries. As a crack forms in the host substrate, the vacuum gallery is breached and a loss of vacuum occurs, which is indicative of the presence of a crack at that location. The CVM system has several advantages, such as simplicity and not requiring electricity to function. The main disadvantage of this technology is that the silicon sensors need to be custom manufactured for the specific section of a structure and are not practical for monitoring rotating aerospace components. Bonded strain and crack gauges have also been applied for crack detection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475921712449509">3</xref></sup> However, the debonding of the gauges from the structures, mainly at high strains, is the main disadvantage of these sensors. Also, due to stiffness mismatch between the sensor and the substrate, the sensor may either develop cracks before the substrate or remain intact and bridge the crack in the substrate. Surface mountable crack detection system (SMCDS) has also been developed for crack detection in aerospace and other structural applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475921712449509">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have shown a potential for sensing and monitoring the health of structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475921712449509">5</xref></sup> CNT networks are piezoresistive, meaning that at low strains, below any damage threshold, changes in electrical resistance can be directly related to changes in strain. Different forms of CNT materials have successfully been evaluated for this purpose including CNT film (buckypaper),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475921712449509">6</xref></sup> CNT-modified polymers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475921712449509">7</xref></sup> CNT-enhanced laminate composites,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475921712449509">8</xref></sup> layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of CNT,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475921712449509">9</xref></sup> and CNT fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475921712449509">10</xref></sup> The effects of crack formation and large strains on resistance and capacitance of CNT polymer thin films were investigated by Kang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475921712449509">11</xref></sup> Continuous conductivity networks formed throughout resins via the addition of CNT have also been used to detect the onset and growth of different matrix-dominated damage modes in polymer matrix composite structures. The formation and propagation of matrix cracks and delamination will disrupt these networks and will manifest themselves via a monotonic increase in the overall volumetric resistance. CNT offers several advantages for this application as compared to other conductive nanofillers, such as metallic particles or carbon flakes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475921712449509">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475921712449509">13</xref></sup> Their extremely small sizes and high length-to-diameter ratios (a few nanometers and microns in diameter and length, respectively) imply that only a very small content of CNT (typically less than 0.5 wt% by weight) is required to form a uniform network throughout the matrix, resulting in the potential of minimum changes to resin processability and other resin and composite properties. The success of the resistance–damage detection technique has already been examined using several tests, such as tensile and bending tests,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475921712449509">8</xref></sup> fatigue and dynamic tests,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475921712449509">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475921712449509">15</xref></sup> and tests of mechanically fastened composite joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475921712449509">16</xref></sup> Using CNT for SHM of metallic structures has also been examined in the literature. For example, the potential of using CNT-based skins for corrosion monitoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475921712449509">17</xref></sup> and impact damage detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475921712449509">18</xref></sup> was recently studied.</p>
<p>This study examines the possibility of using the conductive nanocomposite thin films for monitoring cracks in metallic structures. This CNT-based thin film sensor has the potential to provide continuous monitoring of crack propagation by employing resistance-based damage detection techniques. The basic approach behind this study is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921712449509">Figure 1</xref>. A thin insulating layer, separating the thin film from the metallic structure, is mounted on the metallic structure. A CNT-modified epoxy thin film, referred to as sensor, is then mounted on the insulating layer. As a crack develops in the metallic host structure, a continuous rupture occurs in the insulating layer and conductive nanocomposite film, inducing a monotonic increase in the measured resistance. The success of this approach largely depends on the successful transfer of the crack from the host structure to the sensitive conductive nanocomposite film through the insulating layer. In an ideal case, the crack on the nanocomposite sensor should exactly follow the crack on the metallic substrate. As an added benefit to this sensing approach, the developed sensor also can be used for monitoring strain by exploiting the piezoresistive characteristics of CNT networks. The desired electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity of this sensor can be achieved with the introduction of relatively small amounts of CNT (less than 1 wt%). This permits the retention of the transparency of the carrier polymer to allow visual inspection of developing cracks under the sensor. In addition to demonstrating the concept of using nanocomposite thin film sensors for the crack detection application, the effects of different variables on the performance of the nanocomposite sensor will be shown. These variables include CNT content, the type and configuration of insulating layer, and the configuration of the conductive film (either mounted or painted).</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>The low-viscosity, room-temperature curing 105 Epoxy Resin and the 206 Slow Hardener (West System) combined in a five-part resin to one-part hardener ratio were used as the polymeric matrix precursor. The epoxy resin and curing agent were used as-received without any further purification or processing.</p>
<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were used as the conductive filler to develop the conductive epoxy. SWCNTs were synthesized by the two-laser method as reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475921712449509">19</xref></sup> The as-produced material was purified using an in-house method based on successive flotation and centrifugation steps that do not introduce additional defects to the SWCNT wall, as determined by multiple characterization techniques, including absorption and Raman spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and thermogravimetry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475921712449509">20</xref></sup> The concentration of residual catalysts (Ni and Co) in the purified SWCNT was less than 6 wt% as determined by thermogravimetric analysis. Absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the carbonaceous purity of the purified SWCNT material. The estimated purity was 78% following the method described by Itkis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475921712449509">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>SWCNTs were incorporated into the 105 Epoxy Resin by a solution processing method. A suspension of SWCNT in tetrahydrofurane (THF) was formed with the aid of a sonication bath. The desired amount of epoxy resin was added to the SWCNT/THF suspension followed by a 1-h bath sonication and high-shear mixing for 10 min. The THF was removed at room temperature by sparging the mixture with air overnight and then drying it in a vacuum oven at 80°C for 4 h.</p>

<title>Preparation of SWCNT-modified epoxy films</title>
<p>Thin films of the epoxy nanocomposites with different contents of SWCNT (0–1 wt%) were prepared for electrical, optical, and mechanical characterizations. The nanomodified epoxy was first mixed with the hardener, at room temperature. After thorough hand-mixing of the two components, the resin was degassed at −90 kPa and room temperature for 30 min before it became too viscous for proper application. Using a glass substrate already coated with a release agent and metallic shims with appropriate thickness, the resin was then spread uniformly into a film and cured for 10–15 h to form free-standing thin films of 20 mm wide, 0.12 mm thick, and greater than 100 mm in length.</p>

<title>Characterization of SWCNT-modified epoxy</title>
<p>The electrical conductivities of the SWCNT/105 Epoxy Resin thin films, with various SWCNT contents, were measured by obtaining the voltage versus current curves of the films using a Keithley 2635A SourceMeter. The specimen thickness was first measured at several points using a flat anvil Mitutoyo micrometer with an accuracy of ±1 µm. Silver conductive epoxy (MG Chemicals) and wires were applied to the planar surfaces of the nanocomposite films, to serve as electrodes. The planar areas of the specimens were then measured by planimetry using a stereoscopic optical microscope. The source voltage was then swept from 0 to 1 V for each specimen, and the current was measured and recorded. The maximum voltage was set low to prevent damaging the film from overheating.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the transparency level of nanocomposite thin films, their total light transmittance in the wavelength range from 200 to 800 nm was measured using a Cary 5000 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer equipped with a film sample holder. The area of sample exposed for the analysis was 2.5 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The mechanical properties of the nanocomposite thin films were determined by testing free-standing specimens under tension, until failure. A microtensile test frame (Fullam Substage Test Frame) was used to measure Young’s modulus (<italic>E</italic>), ultimate tensile strength (<italic>UTS</italic>), ultimate tensile strain (ε<sub><italic>max</italic></sub>), and toughness (<italic>G</italic>) of the baseline epoxy and nanocomposite thin films. At least five strips of each material, approximately 5 mm wide and 25 mm long, were tested and the results were averaged. A displacement rate of 1 mm/min was used for all tensile tests.</p>

<title>Design of nanocomposite crack detection sensors</title>
<p>Two nanocomposite films with 0.3 and 1 wt% contents of SWCNT were chosen to develop the nanocomposite film sensors. The sensors were separated from the conductive host structure by an insulating layer. The thickness of both insulating layer and nanocomposite sensor was optimized to allow crack transfer from the substrate to the sensor. If the thicknesses are too thick, the layers will not fail and instead they will bridge the crack on the host structure. If the thicknesses are too thin, this also causes practical difficulties during the application and installation of the layers. As a result, a thickness of ∼100–125 µm was chosen as a compromise. As a crack propagates through the substrate as well as the sensor, the resistivity of the thin film continuously would increase due to a reduction in cross-sectional area, as reflected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921712449509">Figure 1(a)</xref>. This change in resistance (or current) can be directly correlated with the change in crack length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921712449509">Figure 1(b)</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1475921712449509">equation (2)</xref>, a linear correlation is expected between the current reduction and the crack length increase. For both 0.3 and 1 wt% SWCNT content nanocomposite films, two methods of sensor installation were examined. The first method (Design 1) involved in situ curing of two layers of the 105 system pure epoxy and a nanocomposite thin film on the host substrate, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475921712449509">Figure 2(a)</xref> (painted sensor). A section of the substrate was first abraded using 600 grit sand paper and cleaned using alcohol. The area was then bordered using 125-µm tapes to control the thickness of the thin film. The pure epoxy resin was hand-mixed with the hardener and uniformly spread onto the surface prepped area. Once the insulating layer had cured, another 125-µm layer of nanocomposite thin film (2 cm × 2 cm) was applied and cured on top of the first layer.</p>

</fig>
<p>The second method (Design 2), different from the previous one, used a thin cement insulating interface layer and a cured CNT-modified epoxy thin film sensor layer (mounted sensor), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475921712449509">Figure 2(b)</xref>. A section of the metallic host substrate had its surface prepared in a similar fashion to Design 1. The high-temperature insulating cement was mixed and applied onto the host substrate using shims to control the insulating layer thickness. This layer should be sufficiently thick, to provide a medium with no visible pores. It was established that the nanocomposite layer cannot be cured in situ in this case, as the cured cement layer contained microscopic pores, which permit the conductive resin to seep through the insulating layer, short-circuiting the sensor. A free-standing nanocomposite thin film was fabricated, as discussed in Section “Preparation of SWCNT-modified epoxy films,” and mounted onto the cement layer using M-Bond 200 strain gauge adhesive. For both designs, electrodes and wires were attached to the sensor layer using silver conductive epoxy (MG Chemicals).</p>

<title>Sensors evaluation under fatigue tests</title>
<p>The proposed nanocomposite sensors were evaluated for the detection and monitoring of a crack propagating using an aluminum test coupon, under fatigue loading. A 10.2 cm × 55.9-cm 7075-T6 aluminum plate was used as the test coupon. The coupon had a central hole of 0.32 cm in diameter, with electrical discharge machining (EDM) end notches, and 0.25 cm in length, on both sides of the hole. The EDM end notches were used to produce stress concentrations that would facilitate the development of symmetric cracks on both sides of the starter notches as the coupons underwent fatigue cycling.</p>
<p>Each sensor design was incorporated on opposite sides of the central hole, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1475921712449509">Figure 3</xref>. All nanocomposite thin film sensors had an area of approximately 2cm×2cm. A 10-V potential was applied across each sensor, for a few minutes, to ensure the proper functioning of the insulating layer (e.g. to establish that there was no current leakage through the insulating layer or overheating of the sensor). The instrumented test coupon was installed in an MTS load frame, and a tension–tension fatigue load, cycling between 4.5 and 45kN (<italic>R</italic> = <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>min</italic></sub>/<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> = 0.1), was applied at a frequency of 5Hz. A Keithley 2635A SourceMeter was used to provide a 10-V potential across each of the nanocomposite thin film sensors and used to acquire current and time data at a sampling rate of 20 Hz.</p>
<fig id="fig3-1475921712449509" position="float">

</fig>
<p>In addition to the recorded load versus displacement data, two sets of sensor output data were recorded during the fatigue test. One set was obtained dynamically and online as the coupon underwent fatigue cycling. The other was obtained off-line under static loading. The online dynamic readings were only recorded for the Design 1 sensors. Off-line electrical data were obtained at intervals of 2500 cycles, while the test coupon was statically loaded at both no load and a maximum load of 45 kN. These off-line static data were acquired for both sensor designs by switching the source meter leads back and forth. In addition to the two sets of electrical readings mentioned earlier, off-line electrical conductivity data were also recorded from no load up to the maximum load (45 kN) at 4.5 kN in increments at 20,000, 50,000, and 70,000 cycles. As explained in Section “Results and discussion,” these additional data were used to study the sensitivity of the sensor output to crack closure (contact of crack surface asperities in the sensor) and strain variations. In order to evaluate the strain sensing capability of the nanocomposite thin film sensors, two standard precision strain gauges (Vishay Micro-Measurements) were applied to the back of the aluminum coupon.</p>
<p>Two traveling microscopes with attached calipers were setup in the front and back of the test coupon to monitor and measure crack growth visually during the tests. A traveling camera (Sony Digital Interface DFW-SX900) was also used to take images. Initially, the test coupon was dynamically loaded for 20,000 cycles until cracks were observed to emerge from both ends of the EDM notches. Measurements were stopped when the crack tips completely propagated through both nanocomposite sensors. Crack growth measurements and off-line electrical data were then taken every 2,500 cycles, until the crack tips had completely propagated through both nanocomposite sensors.</p>

<title>Characterization of nanomodified resin</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1475921712449509">Figure 4</xref> shows the results from the electrical conductivity and optical transparency of nanocomposite thin films with 0–1 wt% content of SWCNT. It can be seen from the results that the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite thin films improved significantly (greater than three orders of magnitude improvement) between 0.3 and 0.5 wt% SWCNT content after which no considerable increase in conductivity was found. It is expected that the percolation threshold, that is, the formation of SWCNT conductive network, could be achieved at a SWCNT content of less than 0.5 wt%. This agreed well with the results of other SWCNT-modified epoxy resins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475921712449509">22</xref></sup> The increase in conductivity continued for higher SWCNT content samples as well but not as notably as in the percolation threshold region. Surprisingly, it is found that the 0.8 wt% nanocomposite had a slightly lower conductivity than the 0.5 wt% nanocomposite. This may be the result of poor dispersion of CNT within the resin due to the absence of any chemical functionalization scheme during CNT and resin mixing.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the optical transmittance of the produced nanocomposite thin films decreased considerably with an increase in the SWCNT content. In fact, samples above 0.3 wt% nanocomposites were almost 100% opaque. Based on these findings, two nanocomposite materials were chosen for the development of the sensors of Designs 1 and 2: a semitransparent 0.3wt% nanocomposite (with a low conductivity), and an opaque 1wt% nanocomposite (with the highest electrical conductivity). A thin film with relatively high electrical conductivity would be preferred for the crack detection sensor design, as it would provide a strong signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), particularly at measurements close to the resolution of the equipment used. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475921712449509">Table 1</xref> summarizes the four different nanocomposite thin film sensors with different design parameters used in this study.</p>

<p>The tensile properties of nanocomposite materials with 0.3 and 1 wt% of SWCNT, chosen for the development of sensors, are compared with those of baseline resin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921712449509">Figure 5</xref>. For the 0.3 wt% nanocomposite, a 14% increase in Young’s modulus was obtained as compared to the pure epoxy. This increment was in agreement with the theoretical predictions based on Mori-Tanaka for randomly oriented SWCNT composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475921712449509">23</xref></sup> However, the ultimate tensile strength (<italic>UTS</italic>), ultimate tensile strain (ε<sub><italic>max</italic></sub>), and toughness (<italic>G</italic>) remained unaffected. The 1% SWCNT content, on the other hand, caused a significant reduction in the mechanical properties of the thin films (except Young’s modulus). The <italic>UTS</italic> and ε<sub><italic>max</italic></sub> were reduced by almost 35% and 53%, respectively, as compared to the pure epoxy. This can be explained by the fact that no chemical functionalization was used for resin–SWCNT integration resulting in low resin–SWCNT load transfer. A poor dispersion of SWCNT within the epoxy and the formation of small agglomerates (more specifically for 1 wt% nanocomposite) can also explain the lower mechanical properties. As a result, increased SWCNT content contributed to the reduction of the material properties as compared to the pure resin. For crack detection purposes, this reduction might be favorable as the material did not show bridging across the crack. In particular, the brittleness of the nanocomposite films while maintaining stiffness is a desired characteristic. When used as sensors, any crack propagating along the host substrate should develop and progress similarly in the thin film.</p>

<title>Multifunctional crack detecting sensors</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1475921712449509">Figure 6</xref> shows the current stability of the various sensor designs as a function of time before the tests were conducted. A reliable design should be able to maintain a stable output with no evidence of a current drop. A gradual drop in the current across the sensor would be an indication of current leakage and a defective sensor. This phenomenon is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1475921712449509">Figure 6</xref>, in which the nanocomposite thin film was directly cured in situ onto a cement insulating interface. Due to the microscopic pores of the cement insulating layer and in situ process, the nanocomposite resin seeped onto the conductive aluminum substrate compromising the insulating layer. This design was deemed unreliable, as any current drop could not necessarily be attributed to crack formation and growth, and as such was not considered for further evaluation. Only the two designs presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475921712449509">Figure 2</xref> were considered in this study since both designs offered a stable current for an extended period of time with no observed current leakage. In Design 1, the pure epoxy insulating interface was easily made pores free, so in situ curing of the nanocomposite thin film did not result in current leakage. In Design 2, the cement insulating interface was protected, from the mounted nanocomposite thin film by an extra thin adhesive layer to prevent any thin film leakage into the cement layer.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712449509">Figure 8</xref> provides evidence of crack formation and propagation in the nanocomposite sensors for both Designs 1 and 2. During the initial stage of the fatigue test, crack growth was monitored on both sides of the EDM notches. The crack tips reached the insulating interfaces of both sensors at approximately 27,500 cycles. For Sensor 2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475921712449509">Table 1</xref>), the crack in the epoxy interface had a delay (&lt;1 mm) and offset (&lt;0.2 mm) from the crack in aluminum substrate, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712449509">Figure 8(a)</xref>. Disbonding of the epoxy interface from the aluminum substrate was suspected to be responsible for this offset and delay. Otherwise, no disbonding of the sensor from the substrate was detected up to 1000 µε (the maximum strain applied to the sensors as a part of this study). With further fatigue cycling, the two cracks quickly merged into one before entering the nanocomposite layer—a good indication of accuracy in monitoring the crack length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712449509">Figure 8(b)</xref>). This was achieved after the crack propagated about 3 mm into the insulating layer. The crack then entered the nanocomposite sensor and grew in a stable fashion until exiting the opposite end of the sensor. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712449509">Figure 8(c)</xref>, Sensor 2 (with 1 wt% of SWCNT) was totally opaque, so differences between crack length in the aluminum substrate and the sensor could not be seen visually. For Design 1 (with 0.3 wt% SWCNT), however, the underlying structure could still be visually monitored, as the nanocomposite was semitransparent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712449509">Figure 8(d)</xref> shows a crack entering Sensor 1. In this case, no insulating layer was applied intentionally to evaluate the transparency of this sensor. Similar to Sensor 2, two separate cracks were initially observed (one on the sensor and the other on the substrate). The two cracks merged into one after 1.5 mm of growth in the sensor.</p>

<p>For Design 2 (Sensors 3 and 4), no visual verification of crack length difference between the host aluminum substrate and the sensors was possible due to cement opacity. For these two sensors, the crack started to grow gradually through the cement until it reached the nanocomposite sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712449509">Figure 8(e)</xref>). However, the crack transfer from the insulating layer to the sensor was not immediate and took almost 20,000 cycles, and included a sudden crack formation and propagation of about 3 mm. From this point, the crack progressed in the nanocomposite in a stable manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712449509">Figure 8(f)</xref>), following the crack in the aluminum substrate. It is worth noting that the progress of the crack on the aluminum substrate was successfully monitored from the reverse side of the test coupon. It is possible that the adhesive used to install the nanocomposite sensor absorbed some energy causing a delay in the early stages of crack formation in the sensor.</p>

<title>Crack growth monitoring using off-line (static) data</title>
<p>It is expected that the crack growth, hence reduction of the nanocomposite cross-sectional area, would be linearly proportional to the current drop (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1475921712449509">equation (2)</xref>). As a result, instead of resistance change, the change in current was implemented as the sensing parameter. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1475921712449509">Figure 9</xref> illustrates the current change in nanocomposite sensors (Sensors 2 and 4) as well as the crack growth as a function of the number of fatigue cycles. These data were based on off-line current measurements for two extreme cases (crack open at maximum applied load, 45kN, and crack closed at zero load). This graph presents the results when the cracks started entering the 1wt% of SWCNT nanocomposite sensors (both designs) after 43,000 cycles. At zero load, there was no significant change of the current with crack growth. This was most likely the result of crack closure at this loading condition, permitting current flow through contact of asperities in the failed surfaces of the nanocomposite film. It was also noted that despite the crack propagation through the nanocomposite films, current initially increased. We are not certain why this phenomenon occurred. One hypothesis for this increase was the formation of a plastic zone in front of the crack tip, before the formation of cracks in the sensors. It was possible that the SWCNT located in this plastic zone experienced a slight alignment perpendicular to the direction of crack propagation, increasing the sensor conductivity and hence the output current. This increase was higher for Design 1 (Sensor 2) than Design 2 (Sensor 4). It is speculated that the adhesive layer in Design 2 reduced the size of the plastic zone as a result of its energy absorption capacity. For Design 2, the drop of conductivity, observed at 60,000 cycles (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1475921712449509">Figure 9</xref> by an arrow), is the result of sudden crack formation in the nanocomposite film, as explained previously in Section “Multifunctional crack detecting sensors.”</p>

In all cases, the sensor current outputs did not immediately drop after the crack entered the nanocomposite thin films. The sensors became sensitive to crack growth only after the crack had propagated approximately 10% of the total sensor length. We can deduce that the nanocomposite thin film sensors have a threshold, after which a linear output response can be obtained. As explained previously, this threshold can be related to the conductivity change of the nanocomposites due to plastic deformations.</p>

<p>For the 1% SWCNT content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1475921712449509">Figure 10(a)</xref>), both sensor designs showed an almost perfect linear response, with a coefficient of determination of 0.98, to crack length after the threshold. Despite being prepared and installed using two different techniques, both sensors provided a linear current versus crack length relationship of −1.7 × 10<sup>−8</sup> A/mm. For 0.3 wt% SWCNT content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1475921712449509">Figure 10(b)</xref>), there was a sensitivity difference between the two sensors (Sensors 1 and 3). The linearity coefficient for Sensor 1 was −4 × 10<sup>−11</sup> A/mm with a very high coefficient of determination of 0.99. The linearity coefficient for Sensor 3 was lower by almost an order of magnitude (−6 × 10<sup>−12</sup> A/mm), and the coefficient of determination was also lower (∼0.9) than for Sensor 1. For the linearity coefficient variation, because the nanocomposite is near the percolation threshold value (the content at which SWCNT conductivity networks first form inside the epoxy resin), it is expected that the resin conductivity changes from one batch to another; more specifically, the two nanocomposite sensors were prepared using two different techniques and no functionalization was implemented. For the coefficient of determination variation, the lower confidence factor for Sensor 4 can be attributed to low SNR (about 1-nA signals). The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1475921712449509">Figure 10</xref> suggest that the linear correlation between current and crack length would allow monitoring of cracks once the threshold (about 10% of sensor length) had been achieved. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1475921712449509">Figure 9</xref> also showed a sharp drop in sensor output and deviation from linearity when the crack exited the sensors.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449509">Figure 11</xref> shows the results of in situ conductivity measurements as a function of the number of cycles for Sensor 2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449509">Figure 11(a)</xref> presents all 400,000 points collected; whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449509">Figure 11(b)</xref> presents a reduced set of data points, representative of maximum, minimum, and average current measurements per cycle over 1000 cycles.

In both loading modes, there was an initial increase in current followed by a decrease once the crack was formed and propagated. The large range of current variation per cycle, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449509">Figure 11(a)</xref>, can be partly due to the crack closure and contact of the sensor asperities across the crack at low loads and partly due to piezo-resistive behavior of nanocomposites. In order to find out the importance of these two factors, the sensitivity of the current to strain change and crack closure/asperity contact was investigated. For this purpose, the sensor was gradually loaded from zero load up to 45 kN (maximum) in increments of 4.5 kN while the current change was monitored.</p>

It was observed that the sensitivity of the current to the applied load (strain) was very low at 25,000 cycles (when the crack had not reached the sensor layer), as compared to the 70,000 cycles condition (when the crack was closed; i.e. when the sensor asperities were in contact during the portion of the load cycle when the load was less than 60% of <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub>). The inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921712449509">Figure 12</xref> shows the linear correlation between the current and load (or strain) change at 25,000 cycles due to the piezoresistive behavior of CNT network, but this sensitivity was very low as compared to the crack opening (70,000 cycles). As a result, sensor failure surface asperity contact is believed to be mainly responsible for the large current variation reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449509">Figure 11</xref>. It is also clear that current variation range increased as the crack propagated further along the sensor. Additionally, it was noted that crack opening considerably reduced the current ratio (<italic>i/i</italic><sub><italic>P</italic><italic>=</italic>0</sub>) in the range of 10%–40% of the maximum load. After 40% of maximum load, the crack was mostly open with no sensor failure surface asperity contact, and no additional current drop was detected by increasing the load any further. This furthermore confirms the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449509">Figure 11(b)</xref> in which the average current in each cycle was closer to the minimum current (the current when the crack was open), leading to a conclusion that the average current per cycle is more effective than using the maximum current at zero load for crack detection purposes as demonstrated in the previous section for static (off-line) data. Ideally, current measurements with the cracks fully opened would provide the highest fidelity results.</p>

<title>A new sensing parameter: normalized current difference</title>
<p>It was shown that for both dynamic (online) and static (off-line) measurements, two external sources (crack closure/sensor asperity contact and an initial increase of conductivity before crack stabilization) affect the performance of crack detection sensors. If the source of this initial increase was due to the formation of a plastic zone in front of the crack tip, the change in the current output should remain the same upon unloading of the coupon. Due to the fact that no considerable current drop was detected when the crack was closed at zero load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1475921712449509">Figure 9</xref>), we can conclude that the difference between the maximum current (at zero load or when sensor asperities were in contact, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>P</italic>=<italic>min</italic></sub>) and the minimum current (at 45 kN or when the crack was open, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>P</italic>=<italic>max</italic></sub>) at each fatigue cycle should be purely a function of crack length. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1475921712449509">Figure 13</xref> shows the normalized current difference in the sensing parameter, (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>P=min</italic></sub>−<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>P=max</italic></sub>)/<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>P=min</italic></sub>, as a function of crack length. As can be seen, this parameter, unlike the minimum current used in Sections “Crack growth monitoring using off-line (static) data” and “Crack growth monitoring using online (dynamic) data,” showed a linear decrease as soon as the crack formed and started to propagate in the nanocomposite sensors, eliminating the sensitivity to crack closure and sensor asperity contact. This parameter was linearly proportional to the crack length, and hence, it is suggested as a better variable than the actual current drop at maximum load (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>P=max</italic></sub>) to measure the crack length. Using this parameter, the crack gauge factor (<italic>s</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>) can be defined as the slope of the normalized current difference versus crack length, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1475921712449509">Figure 13</xref>.</p>

<p>For the 1 wt% nanocomposite sensors, the formula gave <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> of 0.048 and 0.044 from off-line static data for Designs 1 and 2, respectively. The dynamic result of the Design 1 sensor gave a comparable sensitivity factor of 0.038. For nanocomposites with 0.3 wt% of SWCNT, <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> were 0.041 and 0.017 for Designs 1 and 2, respectively. In this figure, it is shown that a few data from the cement interface show an initial deviation from linearity, as also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1475921712449509">Figure 13</xref> by a dashed ellipse. This deviation can be correlated with crack instability as it began to form (see Section “Multifunctional crack detecting sensors”). Each nanocomposite sensor was approximately 20 mm in length. As a result, every 1-mm crack growth ideally caused a 5% reduction to the effective area. This value was close to the crack gauge factors obtained for each design. The only exception was the 0.3 wt% nanocomposite (Design 2), which can be justified by the electrical noise involved with current measurements being in the order of nanoampere, which was also the level of signal strength.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>SWCNT-modified epoxy thin films were successfully used for the monitoring of crack propagation in an aluminum substrate. The core approach was to monitor the current (or resistance) change in these thin films as a crack indicating parameter when the crack in metallic substrate was successfully transferred to the SWCNT-modified epoxy thin films through an intermediate insulating layer. Different designs using two insulating materials, two methods of nanocomposite installations, and different nanocomposite thin films (with two contents of SWCNT) were successfully implemented for the development of the crack length measurement sensors. The developed sensors allowed the monitoring of the crack length with a high level of consistency. This monitoring of cracks offers a significant advantage by enabling less conservative, damage tolerant designs. Secondly, the same sensors offer the possibility of strain monitoring, hence providing a multi-sensing capability. Finally, a semitransparent design with 0.3 wt% nanocomposite was found to provide the possibility of visual inspection of cracks in the sensor and substrate to confirm the electrical measurements. Among the different designs of the nanocomposite sensors, Design 1 (with an epoxy interface) provided a better performance, as the crack transfer to the nanocomposite sensor layer was achieved almost immediately and in a more stable manner. However, Design 2, with a mountable sensor, had a better field ability as compared to Design 1, since the application of paint-on resins on structures may be problematic in the field. In such a case, SWCNT-modified resins with very high viscosity (with SWCNT content of &gt;1%) might be a more practical solution. The comparison between sensors with 0.3 and 1 wt% nanocomposites demonstrated that the former provided the ability of designing a semitransparent sensor while the latter offered better reproducibility and precision, as the tested conductivity was much higher than for the 0.3 wt% nanocomposites. Finally, for all nanocomposite sensors, the application of a normalized current factor was proven to be more accurate than the actual current value as the sensing parameter. Unlike the absolute current values, this parameter changed immediately in a linear fashion once the crack entered the sensor, and it remained effective until it exited the nanocomposite film. As a drawback, the sensors developed in this study might not be effective to detect cracks that grow perpendicular to the electrodes due to minimal disruption of CNT network that can be measured by the electrical setup. These sensors, hence, are more effective in cases where prior knowledge (through previous experiments or numerical modeling) on the relative direction of crack growth is available, in order to install the sensor in an optimal location. It is important to note that the sensors developed in this study are at their early stage. The sensors described in this article are yet to be tested under realistic operational environments (temperature and humidity) in order to examine their performance and reliability. In future studies, it will also be important to consider their performance under multicrack scenarios and the fact that under high strain values, these sensors may disbond. While the design of the sensors was currently limited to a rectangular sensor, the nature of these sensors provides a possibility to modify the area under study and general shape of the sensor (e.g. an arc and spiral vs rectangular), which might provide a better performance in specific applications, such as sensing a crack emanating from fastener holes.</p>
