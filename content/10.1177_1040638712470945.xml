<abstract>
<p>Brucellosis has emerged as a disease of concern in marine mammals in the last 2 decades. Molecular detection techniques have the potential to address limitations of other methods for detecting infection with <italic>Brucella</italic> in these species. Presented herein is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method targeting the <italic>Brucella</italic> genus–specific <italic>bcsp31</italic> gene. The method also includes a target to a conserved region of the eukaryotic mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA gene to assess suitability of extracted DNA and a plasmid-based internal control to detect failure of PCR due to inhibition. This method was optimized and validated to detect <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. in multiple sample matrices, including fresh or frozen tissue, blood, and feces. The analytical limit of detection was low, with 95% amplification at 24 fg, or an estimated 7 bacterial genomic copies. When <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. were experimentally added to tissue or fecal homogenates, the assay detected an estimated 1–5 bacteria/µl. An experiment simulating tissue autolysis showed relative persistence of bacterial DNA compared to host mitochondrial DNA. When used to screen 1,658 field-collected marine mammal tissues in comparison to microbial culture, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 70.4% and 98.3%, respectively. In addition to amplification in fresh and frozen tissues, <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. were detected in feces and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from culture-positive animals. Results indicate the utility of this real-time PCR for the detection of <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. in marine species, which may have applications in surveillance or epidemiologic investigations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Distinct marine mammal-associated strains of <italic>Brucella</italic> were first isolated in 1994 from both Atlantic and Pacific Ocean species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638712470945">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1040638712470945">29</xref></sup> In subsequent years, these pathogenic bacteria have been found to have worldwide distribution, with exposure to, or infection with, <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. documented in many cetacean, pinniped, and marine carnivore species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638712470945">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1040638712470945">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1040638712470945">27</xref></sup> <italic>Brucella pinnipedialis</italic> and <italic>Brucella ceti</italic> have been proposed as formal names for isolates from pinnipeds and cetaceans, respectively, based on metabolic differences in culture and genetic analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638712470945">11</xref></sup> Other genetic studies support 3 distinct lineages with associated host preferences for pinnipeds, dolphins, and porpoises, although host specificity is not absolute.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638712470945">13</xref></sup> Information about exposure and disease prevalence in potentially vulnerable marine mammal populations is growing; however, many questions have yet to be answered, including the specifics of transmission, pathogenicity, and susceptibility.</p>
<p>Numerous serologic methods have been used to assess exposure to <italic>Brucella</italic>, with variable rates of seropositivity reported in a number of species of North Atlantic and Pacific marine mammals, suggestive of enzootic exposure in some populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638712470945">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1040638712470945">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1040638712470945">30</xref></sup> Clinical manifestations of brucellosis in marine mammals are so far described only in cetaceans, with abortion and placentitis, orchitis, visceral and blubber abscesses, musculoskeletal lesions, and meningoencephalitis reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638712470945">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638712470945">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1040638712470945">27</xref></sup> High levels of seropositivity are frequently reported in pinnipeds, and microbiologic isolation is reported in many pinniped species. To date, however, no definitive evidence of associated pathologic change has been described in this taxonomic group, suggesting that the presence or absence of <italic>Brucella</italic>-specific antibodies alone may not adequately assess infection status in individuals or populations of pinnipeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1040638712470945">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1040638712470945">31</xref></sup> Inconsistent seroconversion with known infection has been observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1040638712470945">18</xref></sup> Clinical interpretation of positive titers in stranded pinnipeds during rehabilitation or in captive populations is obfuscated by the absence of detectable disease.</p>
<p>Microbiologic culture is considered the “gold standard” for diagnosis of brucellosis, but drawbacks include availability of suitable premortem tissue samples, requirement of specialized media, long incubation times, and the potential for exposure of laboratory personnel to this zoonotic agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712470945">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638712470945">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712470945">7</xref></sup> Poor postmortem carcass condition and prolonged storage of tissues from marine mammal species may also be hypothesized to reduce the success of attempts to isolate these fastidious organisms. Focal infections may also not avail themselves to standard isolation techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1040638712470945">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Molecular techniques, including conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, are being used with greater frequency for species identification of <italic>Brucella</italic> culture isolates, as well as for diagnostic testing of clinical samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712470945">7</xref></sup> In human diagnostics, PCR techniques have been found to be more sensitive than serologic tests and are considered useful for confirmation of acute or relapsing illness due to <italic>Brucella</italic> in cases where serology or culture have been nondiagnostic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638712470945">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638712470945">21</xref></sup> Veterinary diagnostic applications of PCR have been developed for blood-, milk-, and tissue-based detection of <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. in domestic species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1040638712470945">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638712470945">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Published studies where PCR has been used to survey for <italic>Brucella</italic> in marine mammal tissues, with or without microbiological culture, are uncommon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1040638712470945">27</xref></sup> Molecular detection techniques have the potential to address shortcomings associated with other methods of diagnostic testing for <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. in marine mammals, including questions of sample access, quality and quantity, and limited availability of host species–specific antibody detection reagents. Presented herein is a real-time PCR method developed for rapid screening of marine mammal tissues. The PCR targets the <italic>Brucella</italic> genus–specific <italic>bcsp31</italic> gene and includes 2 quality control targets to assess the suitability of extracted DNA for amplification and the presence of inhibitors of PCR.</p>

Serial dilutions were made of DNA from <italic>B. pinnipedialis</italic>; 4 µl of each dilution were used as template, with final concentrations of 500 fg, 100 fg, 50 fg, 10 fg, and 5 fg bacterial DNA per reaction. To test for amplification competition, 3 combinations of template DNA were compared: bacterial DNA only, bacterial DNA and internal control plasmid (1 fg), and bacterial DNA, internal control plasmid (1 fg), and harbor seal genomic DNA (100 ng).</p>
<p>Baseline fluorescence data for each real-time PCR assay were manually adjusted to values averaged between 15 and 27 cycles. A fluorescence threshold was chosen within the exponential phase of amplification that maximized the correlation coefficients of the standard curves, and this value was used for all validation runs. Regression lines were compared using linear models and a test for slope heterogeneity. Finding that the slopes of the 3 lines did not differ significantly, analysis of covariance and comparison of least square means were used to compare intercepts. Comparison of percentage amplification was done by χ<sup>2</sup> analysis. The limit of detection (LOD; i.e., concentration of bacterial DNA resulting in amplification 95% of the time) was calculated by interpolation of the linear regression of percentage amplification versus log transformed concentration at the 3 lowest concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1040638712470945">t</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1040638712470945">u</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1040638712470945">v</xref></sup></p>

<p>To assess the ability of the assay to detect <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. in a variety of sample matrices, experimental addition of methanol-killed bacteria to tissue, blood, or feces was performed. A homogenate of 1:1 sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1040638712470945">w</xref></sup> and culture-negative spleen from a harbor seal was prepared by maceration<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1040638712470945">x</xref></sup> and spiked with killed <italic>B. pinnipedialis</italic>. Aliquots of PBS were spiked with the same numbers of bacteria. Aliquots (25 µl) of spleen homogenates or PBS were extracted as previously described. To examine degradation of the mitochondrial target with tissue autolysis, spiked aliquots of homogenates were incubated at room temperature, and samples were taken for extraction at 2, 4, 8, and 16 days after preparation. Freshly drawn whole blood was spiked with killed harbor seal–origin <italic>Brucella</italic> bacteria and incubated while rocking at room temperature for 1 hr. Aliquots of 50 μl of whole blood were collected, and the remaining blood was centrifuged to separate plasma, buffy coat, and packed red blood cells to examine possible sample partitioning. Total DNA was extracted separately from 50 μl of each blood component. Feces from a seronegative wild-caught harp seal (<italic>Phoca groenlandica</italic>) were diluted 1:1 with sterile PBS and spiked with killed bacteria, as previously described. DNA was extracted from 100-μl fecal aliquots, including a negative control.</p>
<p>To evaluate the function of the assay’s plasmid-based inhibition control, substances inhibitory to PCR were added to reactions also containing 1 fg of plasmid, 100 ng of harbor seal splenic DNA extract, and 50 fg of <italic>B. pinnipedialis</italic> DNA. To simulate incomplete removal of anticoagulants (potassium EDTA and sodium heparin), solutions made from blood collection tubes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1040638712470945">g</xref></sup> filled to volume with water were added, representing final concentrations of 0.27 M EDTA and 5.7 U/ml heparin.

<title>Performance and interpretation of amplification controls</title>
<p>Both mitochondrial 16S and plasmid targets were always positive under normal conditions, with Ct cut-off values of 30 and 40, respectively. If the mitochondrial 16S control target failed to amplify, but the plasmid beta-globin target was positive, the sample was designated as “failed” due to insufficient amplifiable mitochondrial DNA. If the sample amplified the mitochondrial 16S control target but did not amplify the plasmid beta-globin target, the sample was designated as “failed” due to partial inhibition of amplification. Because the plasmid concentration was low, resulting in high Ct values for this target, and mitochondrial DNA was typically abundant, partial but not complete amplification inhibition frequently prevented amplification of the plasmid but allowed amplification of the latter target at a higher Ct. If both controls were positive but the <italic>bcsp31</italic> target did not amplify, the sample was considered negative.</p>

<p>The objective of the current study was to design a robust but sensitive PCR assay suitable for high-throughput screening of clinical and necropsy samples from marine mammals for the presence of <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. genomic DNA. The chosen <italic>Brucella</italic>-specific target, <italic>bcsp31</italic>, is a conserved single-copy gene coding a 31-kDa outer membrane protein found in all strains of <italic>Brucella</italic> to date, including marine species. A genus-specific target was chosen to check for all possible species of <italic>Brucella</italic> in marine animals, for the widest possible utility, with further identification of individual species and strains possible after PCR screening. The described primer-probe combination has been extensively tested for bacterial target specificity against 59 non–<italic>Brucella</italic> bacteria with no positive amplification. The <italic>bcsp31</italic> gene is a commonly used target for detection of <italic>Brucella</italic> by PCR, and the small size of the amplicon (151 bp) facilitates its use in real-time PCR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712470945">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712470945">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638712470945">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1040638712470945">29</xref></sup></p>

The calculated LOD is comparable to, or better than, that reported from other assays developed for the detection of <italic>Brucella</italic> from clinical samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712470945">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1040638712470945">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1040638712470945">28</xref></sup> Reaction conditions for this assay were optimized for detection of a putatively low copy-number <italic>Brucella</italic> target against a background of host genomic and plasmid DNA, accounting for competitive binding of primers to both plasmid and <italic>Brucella</italic> DNA targets. Although standard curve parameters were subtly altered with addition of plasmid and genomic DNA, there was no reduction in percentage amplification at very low bacterial DNA concentrations that would significantly affect LOD.</p>
<p>Previously described inhibitors to PCR include hemoglobin, heparin, EDTA, and excess DNA concentrations, which can result from incomplete purification of DNA extracts or inaccurate DNA quantification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712470945">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1040638712470945">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1040638712470945">32</xref></sup> The authenticity of a negative PCR result is supported by knowing amplification is possible using the same bacterial target primers in the same reaction tube. Using this plasmid-based amplification target, complete inhibition due to heparin was detected, but not EDTA. Results of the present study differ from those of a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1040638712470945">24</xref></sup> that found decreased sensitivity in PCR reactions with addition of human genomic DNA; however, another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638712470945">15</xref></sup> found similar results, suggesting that concentrations of DNA below a certain threshold may not inhibit PCR amplification.</p>
<p>The mitochondrial DNA quality control target was included to detect failure of a reaction due to insufficient or degraded sample, considered likely in samples from wild-stranded marine mammal carcasses that may have undergone significant autolysis. Although the variable number of mitochondria in different organs precludes absolute comparisons of DNA quantity, this target has utility as an indicator of the absolute ability of the sample to support PCR. In the tissue studies described herein, adequate amounts of DNA were detected in samples from whole tissues, swabs, feces, and blood components of low cellularity such as plasma, although smaller amounts were present in extracts from swabs or fluid samples, as compared to solid tissues. Because Ct values for this target were generally low (i.e., host DNA concentrations were high), this target amplified even when inhibition was detected in the other 2 channels, except with addition of heparin to reaction mixtures where total inhibition was seen. In practice, the failure rate of the mitochondrial target was negligible, reflecting pipetting errors rather than tissue degradation or low DNA concentration.</p>
<p>Amplification of host and bacterial DNA was possible even in the face of significant degradation, as was demonstrated in the simulation of postmortem autolysis. Mitochondrial DNA did not show measurable loss until 8 days of incubation, and there was no effective loss of <italic>Brucella</italic> DNA amplification over the entire 16-day experiment. These results may reflect the relative stability of bacterial DNA compared to that of the host, suggesting that bacterial PCR may be successful even in situations of poor tissue quality. Because the mitochondrial target does not act as a surrogate for bacterial DNA quality, inclusion of this target may not be necessary for that purpose.</p>
<p>Percentage detection of whole cell bacteria varied by tissue, with experimental detection of an estimated 1–5 bacteria/µl in several sample matrices (e.g., tissue, blood, and feces). Because this process includes DNA extraction, differences in extraction efficiency between methods may affect recovery and detection of bacteria. High levels of recovery of spiked bacteria were seen, particularly at low concentrations. The examples of a calculated recovery of &gt;100% are attributed to the variability in Ct values used to generate these values. An additional explanation is the use of estimated counts in killed bacterial suspensions to derive spiked numbers of bacteria.</p>
<p>Amplification was only observed in the plasma fraction of blood. Phagocytosis of bacteria by leukocytes and subsequent concentration in the buffy coat has been reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638712470945">21</xref></sup> but improved sensitivity of PCR has also been observed in human serum compared to whole blood samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638712470945">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1040638712470945">32</xref></sup> The experimental goal of the current study was to show the possibility of amplification from blood and blood components, and killed bacteria were used in the experiments for reasons of availability and safety of laboratory personnel. The in vitro partitioning of killed bacteria in blood may differ from that of live bacteria; additional studies may be warranted.</p>
<p>When used with field-collected tissues, the assay described in the present study agrees with results of microbial culture, the “gold standard,” in the majority of cases. The calculated diagnostic sensitivity may not reflect true utility of this test to detect <italic>Brucella</italic>. In cases where PCR results were negative in the face of a positive culture, discrepancies may be explained by differences in sampling of potentially low-level or focal infections, as homogenates of large tissue blocks (approximately 5 g) were used for culture, while DNA was extracted from 10 to 25 mg of solid tissue. Field samples found to be PCR-positive but culture-negative were frequently from animals with other culture- or PCR-positive tissues, suggesting not “false positives,” but infection not detected by culture. Amounts of bacterial DNA detected in PCR-positive and culture-negative tissues were generally low, close to the LOD. Suboptimal or prolonged storage of frozen tissues may have decreased bacterial viability, limiting successful culture. Alternately, real false positives may have occurred from cross-contamination of tissues with bacteria during necropsy tissue collection or storage.</p>
<p>Blood cultures were not performed in large numbers of field cases tested in the current study. No blood or blood component was positive by PCR by the assay. Only 2 culture-positive animals had blood and tissues submitted, and both individuals were negative. Most of the blood samples came from wild, presumptively healthy animals, which would not be expected to have bacteremia. Fecal culture for <italic>Brucella</italic> was problematic due to overgrowth by fecal flora and was not pursued further. Four animals positive by PCR and culture of tissues were also positive by fecal PCR, but fecal shedding was not consistently seen. The assay also successfully amplified <italic>Brucella</italic> DNA from culture-positive, paraffin-embedded tissues, although detection was most successful when multiple paraffin blocks from the same animal were tested.</p>
<p>Comparison of the technique described herein with serology was not possible because very small numbers of submissions to the current study included both serum and tissues from an individual animal. While serology has clear utility in assessing rates of exposure to <italic>Brucella</italic> in populations, known deficits of serologic testing underline the necessity for direct identification of <italic>Brucella</italic> sp. by either culture or PCR for definitive diagnosis in an individual case.</p>
<p>In summary, the described method is a sensitive, specific, real-time PCR technique for detection of <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. bacteria in a variety of sample matrices. The assay has the benefit of improved speed and safety compared to culture and identifies the direct presence of the organism. Although intended and validated for use with marine mammal tissues and marine-origin <italic>Brucella</italic> spp., previous studies have shown utility of this primer-probe combination for all recognized species of <italic>Brucella</italic>. Field use of this assay indicates that replicate testing of multiple tissues from an individual provides the most accurate evaluation of infection status.</p>
