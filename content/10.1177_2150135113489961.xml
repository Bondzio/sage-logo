<title>Surgical Technique </title>
<p>Surgical techniques at our institute evolved over the study period. Currently, the surgical technique includes detailed preoperative assessment of the functional anatomy of the anterior and the posterior valve leaflets utilizing two- and three-dimensional echocardiography. A clear picture of which leaflet segments have elongated chordae is sought. This allows the surgeon to plan how much the chordae should be shortened for anterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse, either directly or with insertion of prosthetic tissue. Wedge resection is used for posterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse. Thickening of the posterior mitral valve leaflet can be peeled away. Most repairs include the insertion of a full rigid annuloplasty ring that restores the correct size and oval shape of the inlet. Following repair, if transesophageal echocardiography indicates greater than 6 mm Hg mitral valve gradient or greater than mild mitral regurgitation, the repair is revised unless the surgeon judges that the repair cannot be improved.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Indication for surgery was severe mitral valve regurgitation in 71 (86.4%), severe mitral valve stenosis in five (4.9%), and mixed mitral valve disease in five (8.6%); 15 of the 81 (18.5%) patients had surgery during the acute phase of rheumatic fever. An additional 9 (11.1%) patients had surgery when their acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) had normalized. The remainder had chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the 21st century, RHD is a disease of the impoverished. Although there are increasing numbers of surgical reports demonstrating excellent long-term surgical outcomes following valvular surgery for RHD, this is not the case for the majority. Most patients with RHD disease simply do not have access to cardiac surgery. It has been estimated that in Africa alone, up to 100,000 individuals would require life-saving cardiac surgery for RHD, yet only 1,800 are performed per annum. The available cardiac surgical facilities are clearly unable to meet global demands. Those who are fortunate enough to undergo cardiac surgery and then return to the place of origin may face challenges that include poor access to primary health care, cardiac services, cardiac medication, and anticoagulation monitoring. In these settings, cardiac surgery can be considered palliative.</p>
<p>With our results showing improved survival, less morbidity, and no loss of durability relative to mitral valve replacement, mitral valve repair is the procedure of choice for rheumatic mitral valve disease in the young. The global shortage of cardiac surgeons able to perform satisfactory rheumatic valve repair must be addressed. This needs to be paralleled with the establishment of comprehensive register-based rheumatic heart disease control programs to halt disease progression.</p>
