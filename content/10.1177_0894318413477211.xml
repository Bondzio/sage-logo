<p>At an international nursing conference focusing on quantitative and qualitative research, the question arose regarding what is appropriate evidence to guide nursing practice. Inasmuch as evidence-based practice originated with medicine, what does that have to do with nursing? It is interesting to note that there are many linguistic permutations when the commonly used construct <italic>evidence-based practice</italic> is discussed in light of nursing. The various phrases that surfaced in the discussion with nurse scholars from Canada, Greece, Switzerland, and the United States included the following: evidence-based practice, research-guided practice, practice-based research, science-based practice, knowledge-based practice, and others. Each of these phrases had a slightly different meaning, but no clear definition or discerning distinction among the constructs surfaced from the discussion. The phrases as related to nursing seemed to be <italic>buzz words</italic>, and this became very clear in the discussion about what research findings should be considered evidence worthy of guiding practice. Unfortunately the discussion showed that much of the evidence used to guide nursing practice worldwide does not arise from findings arrived at through rigorous research studies but, rather, often from studies with faulty protocols, manipulated statistics, no frames of reference, no supported hypotheses, and with other egregious conceptual and methodological violations. Further, participants at the meeting shared information surrounding the curriculum of baccalaureate and higher degree nursing programs. What surfaced was the fact that frequently faculty in these programs were mandated to add to all course outlines the words <italic>evidence-based practice</italic>, because accrediting agencies had added these words to the criteria for evaluation of nursing programs. According to those reporting, this often happened without discussion among faculty members or any change in course content. Participants also reported that the persons receiving nursing care are most often not taken into consideration, since the relentless drive for research evidence places importance on aggregate data. What meaning does person-centered care have in light of evidence-based practice? How does nursing-theory as a guide to practice connect with evidence-based practice? Is there lack of clarity about the many meanings of evidence-based nursing practice?</p>
<p>To qualify as evidence worthy to guide nursing practice, research findings must arise from rigorous conduction of qualitative and quantitative research. This means that there must be a completed research study with a clearly stated phenomenon related to nursing science, a formal research design with a research question stated in interrogatory form, a nursing framework, related literature, an appropriate design to answer the question, appropriate data collection procedures, and accurate analysis-synthesis of data with findings related to the nursing frame of reference that guided the study. Before any research findings are used in practice, a critique of the studies must include the aforementioned criteria.</p>
<p>Two scholarly articles are published in this issue of <italic>Nursing Science Quarterly</italic>. Each author offers a different view of research as evidence. Since there are so many permutations, uses, and misuses of the construct evidence-based practice, and so many questions about the use of evidence as related to person-centered care, it behooves nurse scholars and nurse leaders in education and healthcare institutions to clarify what is meant by the construct. Judicious monitoring is required so that only appropriate evidence is used to guide nursing practice to insure the care and safety of the persons served by nurses.</p>
