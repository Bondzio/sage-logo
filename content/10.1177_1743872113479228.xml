<p>Colin Dayan relates a Haitian story about how bad magic can revive the spirit of a dead human ancestor and trap it in the skin of a spectral white dog, doomed to roam at night and “steal your soul, tear at your flesh, and thieve your mind.” (252) This ghost-dog, she shows us through a breath-taking tour through legal and cultural contexts richly and passionately portrayed, is what the law is. What does it mean for her to say that the <italic>law</italic> is a white dog?</p>
<p>According to Dayan, it means, first, that a hidden past haunts the law, despite “white” (white-washed and racially-biased) veneers of legal progress. It means, second, that fiction and irrationality haunt the law, despite “white” (clear and “bright line”) claims of legal rationality. It means, finally, that law, as a practice, can, sorcery-like, make and unmake persons, transform fictions into facts, and even “make men dogs and dogs trash.” (241)</p>
<p>Dayan aspires to do more than debunk the “rationality” of law; she cries out against the injustice and violence that law’s word-twisting makes both possible and invisible. The book’s strength is its close attention to two rhetorically connected areas of law’s “haunting:” imprisonment (39–112), and slave law (113–176). Her descriptions and accounts of civil death, force-feeding, mind-killing solitary confinement, and slavery and its inheritors, should be required reading. She asks the reader to pay close attention to the legal language used to describe and defend these practices and to how that legal language twists everyday words, torques moral categories, and turns metaphors into realities. These images of legal zombies – legally imprisoned or enslaved bodies deprived of spirit – will certainly haunt the reader, and they should.</p>
<p>But leaving those parts of the book to speak for themselves, as they do so well, I want to attend here to the mode of her argument – for she does mean to persuade as well as to describe. Dayan’s first claim, that the past haunts the law, is not a surprising claim, at least to lawyers. It would be a naïve theory of law that fully ascribed to Blackstone’s metaphor of law’s “working itself pure” in a kind of constant progress, though Dayan reminds us that such august legal characters as John Wigmore (288 n. 7) and Oliver Wendell Holmes made claims like this. But lawyers know better. Just as <italic>Ex parte Quirin</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1743872113479228">1</xref></sup> a 1942 case from World War II, long dead and forgotten in the U.S. Reports, springs back to life in 2004 to resurrect a category of “illegal enemy combatants” purportedly outlawed from the 1949 Geneva Conventions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1743872113479228">2</xref></sup> or <italic>Mullaney v. Wilbur</italic> revives from being nearly moribund to helping to take down the Federal Sentencing Guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1743872113479228">3</xref></sup> past law is never dead and buried, but comes anachronistically to life again as soon as analogical argument calls it up from Lethe. But, as the last case illustrates, though sometimes the past revives in defense of government police power, sometimes it revives in defiance of it. While Dayan is right to point to the way the past “haunts” the law, the past doesn’t always “steal souls, tear flesh, or thieve minds” – sometimes it protects them. Legal reasoning proceeds by analogy – and those analogies must always be drawn from past cases. Law is a trans-historical moral argument in which the past is always haunting the present, for good or evil. As Dayan notes: “Legal language makes possible such a compulsion for analogy; its choice of images, its reiterated terms and punishing effects. It is through the law that persons gain or lose definition, become victims of discrimination or inheritors of privilege.” (246)</p>
<p>But Dayan, I think, means to say more than merely that the past haunts the law. It is the past we think we have repudiated, the “irrational” “primitive” “magical” past, that haunts the law and in ways that allow us to suck the souls out of people and create “things” – slaves, ghost detainees, inmates, ‘‘animals’’ – bereft of legal protection, speech, and capacity for action. She traces the “haunting” analogical relation from deodand (an “evil doing” thing that early common law required to be “destroyed” for the harm it caused – whether slippery rock or shifty sword) to civil death and attainder (the ancient practice of outlawry that denied all legal protection to the felon who became to law the equivalent of a wild animal) to Southern-style slavery (which, Dayan claims, remade men into deodands, legally incapable, except of crime) to indefinite solitary confinement (which, she argues, revives the practice of civil death by turning men into mere bodies to be (force)fed and clothed without need for rights of free speech or association). In this regression, law draws on ancient superstition – enspirited things and zombie-like spiritless men – to justify modern repression. For example, Dayan argues, the logic of “attainder” that visited punishment on offenders’ progeny, became the background “haunting” analogy of “tainted blood” that later justified slavery and that itself haunts the racialized and inter-generational penal conditions of the present.</p>
<p>Though she presents these conceptual links with vivid historical, literary, and legal evidence, the argument she gives is not traditional, chronological intellectual history. Nor is her argument “objective” or “balanced,” indeed, it leaves out much of what might be said in defense of some of the legal cases she disembowels.</p>
<p>For example, in Chapter 6 she argues that “intent” requirements for officials who abuse prisoners are unfair protections of government actors. While her charge of government hypocrisy is not unfounded, she brushes over the difference between a civil suit against an individual prison guard (in which the individual officer is being sued for damages), and suits for prospective injunctive relief against the state (in which the intent of a government actor shouldn’t matter), and criminal prosecutions against soldiers for torture (in which case intent should matter, since the soldier is facing prison). The distinction between injunctive relief, damages, and imprisonment, and the requirement of mens rea before the government imposes the latter, is not mere government hypocrisy, but a rule that counter-balances “police power” in many other contexts.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7, she also notes the change in the status of stray dogs from “wild animals” subject to summary execution, to pets whose humans have a good deal of property rights over them. “Ferocity,” Dayan writes of the early period of dog law in the 1850s, “could at any time break through what some courts judged as nothing more than the veneer of tameness. … Appeals courts upheld canine-control ordinances based on the principle that the state’s police power to manage, sequester, and dispatch dogs was virtually unlimited.” (236) She seeks to use this example of unlimited police power as a bridge to her discussion of slave law and, in turn, its relation to contemporary incarceration: “The aftereffects of slavery cast a long shadow over dog law.” (239) Though she is quite right that in the 1960s “when dogs became pets, the law was quick to make amends for previous judgments about their character,” (247) her implicit connection between dog rights and civil rights is interesting rhetorically, but ignores an important historical point. Dayan doesn’t mention that by the 1960s the threat of certain death from a dog bite had been all but eliminated by the invention of the rabies vaccine. It may not be just the civil rights movement that elevated the status of dogs, but the conquest of rabies.</p>
<p>In sum, to take this book as history or intellectual history would be to find it less than convincing. However, as an account of the law’s often unconscious and allusive rhetorical connections, the ways in which the words we use charm and seduce us, it is very powerful.</p>
<p>What is Dayan’s method here? Her connections are suggestive, analogical. Her exposition takes us from case to case, skipping back and forth between places and centuries. She makes a case for “overruling” these “bad magic” precedents because of their repressive and immoral contexts, antecedents and effects. As in legal argument, it is not primarily the chronology, but the closeness of the analogy and the “reason” of the case that matters. The irony of Dayan’s book is that her argument is itself a quasi-legal one, normative not descriptive, pointing us to cases that set up moral tent-poles of certainty in the messy continuum of the law (“zombies are superstition,” “deodand and attainder are irrational,” “slavery is wrong”), and then asking us to draw analogies to our own practices of detention and imprisonment and declare those wrong and irrational, too, by analogy. However, if Dayan’s point is that law’s analogical reasoning is capable <italic>only</italic> of twisting and morphing, haunting and hiding, then we haven’t really found a less “superstitious,” or more “rational” way to decide cases.</p>
<p>Perhaps a better interpretation of Dayan’s effort here comes from her first chapter. Dayan says: “If there is a remedy for the bad magic, the damages of law, we must try to describe what such a healing metamorphosis would look like. The dread of threat and stigma can be countered by a healing that is not so much segregation as coalescence.” (36) To explain, she draws upon the story of Apollonius, who tells a boy bitten by a rabid white dog to seek healing from the dog itself. The dog licks the wound, and both boy and dog are healed. Perhaps, as Dayan hints in her opening chapter, the healing must come from the same source as the injury. The only cure for harmful analogies, perhaps, is better analogies, more care for the logical and moral consequences and inconsistencies we may create, and more attention to the resonance and provenance of the words we say – a more thoughtful law. In other words, the hair of the dog that bit us. <italic>The Law is a White Dog</italic> is an important and powerful contribution to that effort.</p>
