<abstract>
<p>This study investigated the effects of participating in a book reading club on improving parents’ positive interactions with children and positive thinking. A total of 85 parent volunteers were randomized into the experimental or comparison group. The Parent Questionnaire was used to measure positive thinking and interaction with children. Additionally interview results were used to triangulate and elucidate the findings. The findings revealed a positive impact on parents’ positive thinking and interaction with children and that these were significant predictors of parents’ positive thinking. Implications and recommendations are presented.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A large body of research has documented parental influence on children’s cognitive and affective development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311413481">Gecas and Schwalbe, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311413481">Halloran et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1359105311413481">Zhou et al., 2002</xref>). For instance, Gecas and Schwalbe found parental support and positive interaction with children to be an important influence on children’s self-esteem and self-worth development because family is where the initial sense of oneself is formed. Zhou et al. revealed that parents play a large role in the social and emotional behaviors a child will possess during childhood and later in life; Halloran et al. claimed that parental connectedness was protective against many adolescent health risks including emotional health.</p>
<p>Therefore, parents have the necessity to learn parenting learning strategies from some effective learning environment. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311413481">Greenfield (2009)</xref>, informal learning environments have widespread impact including the development of adults’ cognitive skills and their abilities to solve social problems. Adults learn most of what they know about through free-choice learning using informal education resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311413481">Falk et al., 2007</xref>). While there are ample studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311413481">Fantuzzo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311413481">Fraser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311413481">Hong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311413481">Hong et al., 2008</xref>) that focus on children’s cognition, emotion, and technological learning, there are few studies that focus on adult learning. Because parents are an important determinant of children’s social and emotional development, it is important to pay more attention to adult learning, especially if the adults are parents of school-aged children.</p>
<sec id="section2-1359105311413481">
<title>Parental influence on children and parental learning strategies</title>
<p>In the past five decades, many family function studies have focused on how different parenting practices influence children’s psychological development and social behavior (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311413481">Baumrind, 1991</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311413481">Baumrind (1991)</xref> found that good adjustment in children was associated with parents who used firm, consistent discipline with warmth and support, a combination she labeled ‘Authoritative’. Researchers have pointed out that father–child interactions are more physical and more likely to engage rough and tumble play while mother–child interactions are more likely to be verbal and to involve more conventional play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311413481">Le Camus, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311413481">Paquette, 2004</xref>). Because of the fact that parent behavior is associated with children’s development, such as children’s gender identity development, these findings are noteworthy because it is one of the most consistent socio-environmental variables to be associated with children’s cognitive, communicative, and social-emotional functioning through the early childhood years, even for children with developmental vulnerabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311413481">Spiker et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>For most parents, parenting classes are traditionally school based, but other sources like parenting classes or talking to their children’s teachers, may either complement information from family and friends or act as an exclusive source of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311413481">Ateah, 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105311413481">Walsh (2002)</xref> parents seem to recognize the importance of effective parenting, and parents demonstrate this partly by seeking information on effective parenting techniques. For instance, parents have expressed interest in learning how to encourage children’s learning and how to establish disciplinary procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105311413481">Walsh, 2002</xref>). Studies found that between 31 percent and 34 percent of parents reported having attended parenting classes or workshops (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105311413481">Young et al., 1998</xref>), and one study of Canadian parents showed 60 percent had attended some sort of parenting group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311413481">Koepke and Williams, 1989</xref>). Therefore, in this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311413481">Marks’ (2010)</xref> publication guidelines for intervention studies were applied and the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs (TREND) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311413481">Des Jarlais et al., 2004</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.TREND-statement.org">http://www.TREND-statement.org</ext-link>) followed. We designed a book reading club intervention for parents; we focused on developing parents’ positive thinking and positive interactions with children with carefully selected content. It is not the typical book reading club where people select books and read them.</p>

<title>The movement of positive thinking</title>
<p>There has been little attention given to the role of positive experiences in mental health and well-being, especially in comparison to research on negative experiences and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311413481">Diener et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311413481">Luthans, 2002</xref>). For example, a literature search in psychology as a whole found approximately 200,000 published articles on the treatment of mental illness; 80,000 on depression; 65,000 on anxiety; 20,000 on fear; and 10,000 on anger; but only about 1000 on positive concepts and capabilities of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311413481">Luthans, 2002</xref>). The ratio of articles examined negative psychological states to those examining positive states 17 to 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311413481">Diener et al., 1999</xref>). This situation reflects the prevailing view in health research generally. As remarked by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311413481">Seligman (2002)</xref>, much of the task of prevention in this new century should be to create a science of human strength with the mission of understanding and learning how to foster the virtues and skills of young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311413481">Caprara et al., 2006</xref>). A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311413481">Schmidt et al. (2011)</xref> indicates that positive psychology is having an increasing influence on the content and approach of health psychology studies. The new branch of positive psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311413481">Seligman, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311413481">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311413481">Seligman and Csikszentimihalyi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311413481">Sheldon and King, 2001</xref>) calls for theoretical conceptualizations and practical initiatives directed toward promoting well-being and wellness for all people, given the assumption that even problematic aspects of individual functioning may be better addressed by strengthening the positives. Led by Seligman and a core group of positive psychologists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311413481">Diener (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311413481">Peterson (2000)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311413481">Snyder (2000)</xref>, the purpose of positive psychology is to shift the emphasis away from what is wrong with people to what is right with people, to focus on strengths, to be interested in resilience, and to be concerned with enhancing and developing wellness, prosperity, and the good life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311413481">Seligman and Csikszentimihalyi (2000)</xref> summarize positive psychology approaches on the subjective level (i.e. positive subjective experience such as well-being and contentment with the past, flow and happiness in the present, and hope and optimism into the future); the micro, individual level (i.e. love, courage, aesthetic sensibility, perseverance, forgiveness, spirituality, high talent, and wisdom); and macro group and institutional level (i.e. responsibility, altruism, civility, moderation, tolerance, and a strong work ethic).</p>
<p>In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311413481">Sasson (2010)</xref> revealed that positive thinking is a mental attitude that permits into the mind thoughts, words, images, and behaviors that are conductive to growth, expansion, and success. A positive global expectation about the future has been linked to desirable and successful outcomes in various settings as well as to better physical health and greater longevity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311413481">Carver and Scheier, 2002</xref>). Many recent studies have shown interesting relationships between hope, optimism, and positive attitudes and health outcomes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311413481">Ai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311413481">Berg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105311413481">Von Lengerke, 2006</xref>). Thus, a major objective of this study was to investigate a book reading club intervention’s effect on improving parents’ positive thinking scores and interaction with children. Three major research questions were investigated: (1) What are the significant differences in parents’ positive thinking scores for arents with different occupations, educational levels, and interaction times with children? (2) What are the significant determinants of arents’ positive thinking? (3) How does experimental group parents’ thinking change after articipating in the book reading club?</p>

<title>Participants and setting</title>
<p>This study took place in a suburb of Southern Taiwan where a total of 100 parents were asked to participate in this quasi-experimental study. Parents were selected because they lived near the investigators’ university. Despite being selected for convenience, the parents are a diverse population. After learning the purpose of the study and being invited to participate, 31 parents (14 fathers and 17 mothers) agreed to join the book reading club intervention and 54 parents (18 fathers and 36 mothers) agreed they would complete the pre- and post-tests but not participate in the intervention. The largest percentage of experimental group parents were self-employed (32.3%), with college degrees (64.5%), who reported spending 36–42 hours per week interacting with their children (35.5%). In contrast, the largest percentage of comparison group parents were homemakers (29.6%), with a junior/senior high school level of education (75.9%), but the largest percentage also reported spending 36–42 hours per week interacting with their children (31.5%). The mean age of experimental group parents is 41.03 (SD = 3.89, range from 36 to 52), while the mean age of comparison group parents is 40.08 (SD = 8.23, range from 25 to 67).</p>

<title>Treatment and procedure</title>
<p>In this quasi-experiment design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311413481">Schaefer and Kornienko, 2009</xref>) the 31 experimental group parents came to the authors’ university at a group-counseling room once a month for a two-hour book reading club intervention from September 2009 to May 2010. The 31 experimental group parents were randomly assigned into six small teams; each small team had five to six parents. All parents engaged in an intervention initiated by the investigators who served as coordinators during the book reading club intervention. The two-hour intervention included the following elements: (1) cooperative learning in which parents read books together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311413481">Johnson and Johnson, 1999</xref>); (2) watching parent–child interaction/positive thinking-related movies; (3) small group discussion in which parents disclosed their feelings and thinking within small teams; (4) reflective interaction by peers that challenged parents’ interaction with children and their perceptions; (5) oral sharing in whole-group discussions based on findings from small team discussions. All participants completed the Parent Questionnaire (PQ) in September 2009 (pretest) and May 2010 (posttest). In addition, the experimental group parents were individually interviewed by the first author in June 2010. The follow-up interview was designed to triangulate and elucidate the quantitative results.</p>

<sec id="section8-1359105311413481">
<title>Parent Questionnaire (PQ)</title>
<p>All participants completed the Parent Questionnaire, a 61-item investigator-developed questionnaire that consists of two sections. Three experts in educational assessment and evaluation and two parents (i.e. one father and one mother) reviewed the items of the questionnaire drafts to determine how essential these positive thinking scale items were. It was found that these experts’ agreement on the PQ content validity ration (CVR) was .99; they fit with the requirements of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311413481">Lawshe’s (1975)</xref> theory. In addition, two adults were randomly selected to read items of the PQ to assure their readability and understanding. The PQ includes demographic items and positive thinking scales.</p>
<p>The first section elicits all respondent demographics (i.e. gender, occupation, educational levels, parent–child interaction time, and family member activities).</p>
<p>The second section includes the 55- item Chinese version of Positive Thinking Scale (PTS) (developed by the first author; some items derived from the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311413481">Derogatis et al., 1974</xref>)). All participants were asked to rate each item using a four-point scale where ‘4’ represented ‘always’ and ‘1’ represented ‘never’. Parents’ responses to the 55-item PTS were analyzed as follows. First, the spread of responses to each item was determined and only those items with a standard deviation greater than 0.6 were retained. All items’ SD were higher than 0.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311413481">Hong and Lin, 2011</xref>). The internal consistency of the items was found to be high (Cronbach’s α = 0.95). Then we performed a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO) and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity that showed a moderate–high KMO = 0.607 and a significant difference of all items (approximate Chi-square = 3513.424, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, d.f. = 1485) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359105311413481">Tabachnick and Fidell, 2001</xref>). Moreover, we performed a Varimax with Kaiser Normalization factor analysis and found four-factor components. If an item loaded on more than one factor, we assigned the item to the factor with a higher factor loading. Taken together, the four factors accounted for 58 percent of the variance. The first factor (named <italic>Optimistic</italic>) included 28 items with a total score range from 28–112 and accounted for 29.4 percent of the variance; a sample item is ‘I can handle my life.’ The second factor (named <italic>Anxiety/depression</italic>) included 15 items with a total score range from 15–60 and accounted for 19.09 percent of the variance; a sample item is ‘I cry easily’ (i.e. these items have been reversed scored). The third factor (named <italic>Self-confidence</italic>) included six items with a total score range from 6–24 and accounted for 4.98 percent of the variance; a sample item is ‘I am comfortable being a success.’ The fourth factor (named <italic>Pessimistic</italic>) included six items with a total score range from 6–24 and accounted for 4.53 percent of the variance; a sample item is ‘I have feelings of worthlessness’ (i.e. these items have been reverse scored). The ratings for all items on each scale are summed; the total score ranges from 55 to 220. A higher total score indicates more positive thinking. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311413481">Table 1</xref> presents means, standard deviations, factor loadings, correlations, and Cronbach’s α result on the 55 items. It can be seen that all items fit within the three indices recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311413481">Cohen (1988)</xref> (i.e. standard deviation higher than 0.6; factor loading bigger than 0.4; and correlation with total score greater than 0.25). The above results indicate that the instrument has an adequate construct validity and internal reliability.</p>

<title>Individual interviews</title>
<p>To further investigate the effects of this intervention, all the experimental group parents were recruited for individual interviews by the first author. Each parent was interviewed for 20–30 minutes using a semi-structured interview protocol one month after the ending of the intervention. All interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. A sample parent interview question is: ‘Do you perceive any differences in your thinking style after joining the book reading club?’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1359105311413481">
<title>Data analyses</title>
<p>First, we performed ANOVAs to determine if there were any significant differences in positive thinking for parents with different occupations, educational levels, and interaction time with children. Second, a forward regression was conducted to measure the determinants of parents’ positive thinking. Third, we conducted paired <italic>t</italic>-tests and ANCOVAs to compare parents’ positive thinking between experimental and comparison group parents. Finally, content theme analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311413481">Patton, 2002</xref>) was used to analyze the individual interview results from experimental group parents.</p>

<title>What are the significant differences in parents’ positive thinking scores for parents with different occupations, educational levels, and interaction times with children?</title>
<p>The results of one-way ANOVAs using data from all of the parents showed positive thinking mean scores on the pretest was significantly different for parents with different occupations (<italic>F</italic> (8, 77) = 3.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The results of Bonferroni post hoc comparisons with different occupations show that parents with professional and self-employed occupations (<italic>M</italic> = 184.13, SD = 23.00) have significantly higher positive thinking scores than the parents who are unemployed (<italic>M</italic> = 148.71, SD = 9.01). In addition, it showed that parents’ positive thinking mean scores on the posttest was significantly different for interaction time with children (<italic>F</italic> (2, 83) = 6.895, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The results of Bonferroni post hoc comparisons showed that parents with high interaction times with children (i.e. 29–42 hours per week) (<italic>M</italic> =177.57, SD = 19.78) have significantly higher positive thinking scores than parents with moderate times with children (15–28 hours per week) (<italic>M</italic> =160.74, SD = 19.28) and parents with low interaction times with children (1–14 hours per week) (<italic>M</italic> =156.60, SD = 21.10).</p>

<sec id="section13-1359105311413481">
<title>What are the significant determinants of parents’ positive thinking?</title>
<p>First, we utilized Pearson correlations to explore significant relationships between the independent variables and parents’ positive thinking on the pretest. The results indicate that group membership and parents’ educational levels have significant correlations with parents’ positive thinking. Second, forward regression results indicate that the group membership explained 16.1 percent of the variance on the pretest of positive thinking (<italic>F</italic> change = 13.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The intervention explained 21.9 percent of the variance on posttest of parents’ positive thinking (<italic>F</italic> change = 17.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In addition, we surprisingly found that parent–child interaction times with children per week explained 2.9 percent of the variance parents’ positive thinking posttest scores (<italic>F</italic> change = 4.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Together the two significant predictors explained 24.8 percent on posttest of parents’ positive thinking total scores.</p>

<p>I am a homemaker, because I felt this was a great opportunity; I joined this book reading club. We read many meaningful books and articles together. We took turns to disclose our thinking and feeling with team members within the book reading club. I learned many great teaching strategies and fostering strategies from coordinators and my team members. I found that not only I made improvement, but also my son Chia-Chen had big changes in his way of communication with me. He found that his thinking changed to be more positive than before.

<p>I graduated from a junior high school. Because my son is a fisherman, he was married at the age of 20, and divorced at the age of 22, so I need to take care of my granddaughter for him. My family economic status is quite a hardship, so we didn’t have any money to send my granddaughter to attend outdoor activities. I always felt I am so unlucky and unfortunate. Whereas, after attending this book reading club with all parents sharing feelings and thoughts with team members, I learned how to educate and communicate with my granddaughter. In addition, the book reading club gradually led me to think positively and built high self-confidence. (8 June 2010).</p>

<title>Positive parent–child interaction</title>
<p>Sam (a father) said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I always believed that education and caring for children are my wife’s responsibilities, I never pay any attention to those things, but in the book reading club all parents discussed and shared with others about their parent–child interactions. I learned how to communicate with children. I found that not only myself changed, but also that my daughter Chia-Yin has more interactions with me. She is getting accustomed to speaking to me gradually, I am so happy and satisfied with these big changes. (11 June 2010)</p>

<p>Eric (a father) said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>After graduating from college, I got married and became a father at the age of 28. I am the breadwinner for my family members, I have never had time to sit down and interact with my children for the past 10 years. I always transferred my father’s practice to my children. While attending the book reading club, we were carefully watching and reviewing movies, for example, ‘October Sky’, ‘Front of the Class’, ‘Legally Blonde’. All parents discussed and shared their perspectives. I learned how to treat and support my children and others from there. I feel that I think more positively and have decreased my anxiety and depression. (8 June 2010)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The <italic>t</italic>-test and ANCOVA results showed that the experimental group had higher posttest scores in positive thinking than the comparison group even after taking the pretest scores into consideration. This shows that participating in the intervention had a positive effect. These gains were experienced across educational levels, occupations, and interactions with children. The experimental group parents obtained higher means on the posttest of positive thinking than their pretest. For example, we found that 35.5 percent of parents with low educational levels (i.e. elementary/secondary school) made significant gains on the PTS from pretest to posttest as was the case for 35.7 percent of parents with lower income occupations (i.e. service personnel/unemployed/other) and 19.05 percent of parents with moderate interaction times with children and 14.29 percent of parents with low interaction times with children.</p>
<p>These findings provide support for the feasibility of implementing book reading club activities for parents, including low educational level and low income parents, when appropriate cooperative learning and reflective peer-assessment procedures are integrated into the treatment and motivating strategies are used for the parents. Especially, we found that the dimensions of optimism and self-confidence were significantly different between the experimental and comparison parent groups. This study suggests that the treatment is feasible and effective for all parents even those with low income or education. It seems that the book reading club has strong effects on promoting parents’ internal positive emotions and thinking styles. As remarked by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311413481">Seligman (2002)</xref>, the task of prevention in the new century should be to create a science of human strength with the mission of understanding and learning how to foster the virtues and skills of young people.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that the book reading club significantly enlightened the parents, therefore providing evidence that a positive, respectful, and supportive learning environment as well as a practical initiative can be effective in promoting well-being and wellness. We conclude that the book reading club was a powerful intervention in which the parents’ active and enthusiastic involvement was the most important element in producing the effects. The experimental group parents were encouraged to communicate their own ideas among peers and to reflect on their own original beliefs and thoughts. In an effort to encourage two-way interactive activities, this study not only focused on promoting parents’ internal reflections on the improvement of positive thinking, but also on providing opportunities for them to interact with their children.</p>
<sec id="section18-1359105311413481">
<title>Implication and recommendations</title>
<p>In general, the PTS instrument worked well: the response rate was high; most participants could read and understand the items; the scales showed adequate internal consistency and evidence of convergent and discriminate validity was promising. The intervention appears to have promoted positive results. These results are due to the parents reading the books and viewing the films as well as to the interactions and discussions with the coordinators and the other parents. We highly recommend this type of book reading club to promote parents’ positive thinking and interaction with their children.</p>
<p>Additionally, and surprisingly, we found that educational levels, occupations, and gender were not predictive of posttest parents’ positive thinking; but intervention and parent–child interaction time were. These findings echo the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311413481">Hales (1990)</xref> who found that parents’ interaction with children is a significant psychological and social resource because they control the atmosphere in which children have their first experience as social beings. Although both experimental and comparison group parents came from diverse backgrounds, it is possible that the people who chose to participate in the study were more motivated to enhance their positive thinking. Also they were different from the comparison parents in terms of education, occupation, and initial levels of positive thinking. In addition, the treatment effect might have been confounded with the attention effect: the responses of the experimental group parents may have been influenced by different features of the intervention. It is possible that just the act of participation may have produced an effect regardless of the elements of intervention (e.g. potential Hawthorne effects; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311413481">McCarney et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study found that a structured book reading club significantly promoted parents’ positive thinking and positive parent–child interaction. This suggests that the elements of the intervention – heterogeneous grouping, reflective peer-assessment, wide topic of book selection, watching related to positive thinking movies, and reflective peer-assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311413481">Lin et al., in press</xref>) – are all potentially important components in enhancing parents’ positive thinking. Teasing apart the importance of these components individually requires further careful evaluative research. A structured book reading club could serve as an alternative for adult education teachers and educators who are interested in developing innovative teaching strategies.</p>
