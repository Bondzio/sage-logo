<abstract>
<p>In this article, the fatigue behaviour of self-piercing riveted joints in 2024-T6 aluminium sheets and carbon fibre composite panels is studied through experimental tests and numerical simulations. This study, aimed to evaluate the best process conditions and the mechanical behaviour of the joint itself, can be divided into few phases: the first one in which the static mechanical behaviour was investigated in order to evaluate the best process conditions (such as the best value of oil pressure of the riveting system) and the second one which had the purpose to determine the fatigue behaviour of the joint. Finally, a finite element method analysis of the riveting process was developed in order to compare the obtained results with the experimental ones. The joining process was simulated using a finite element method code specific for plastic deformation processes, namely DEFORM™, to predict the deformed shape and mechanical fastening mechanism. Results showed how this procedure can be a powerful tool to carry out a proper computer-aided process engineering. The experimental tests showed that the hybrid joint (metal/composite) has good mechanical characteristics both under static and fatigue loads.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1464420712443753" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is well known that fibre composite laminates have a number of advantages over monolithic metals and other materials, such as high strength/weight and stiffness/weight ratios, etc., and are becoming more and more widely used in new products manufacturing.</p>
<p>Carbon fibre is used for the manufacturing of high-performance composites and it is distinguished by its high modulus of elasticity and tensile strength.</p>
<p>In spite of the high strength and fatigue behaviour, composite materials are still very carefully used as assembled structures. It should be observed that in those cases, high reliability and safety must be assured and joining techniques should be carefully chosen in order to avoid failures and breakages.</p>
<p>In this study, the fatigue behaviour of aluminium/carbon fibre joints obtained by self-piercing riveting (SPR) is investigated.</p>
<p>The SPR is an accepted joining process of automobile body panels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464420712443753">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464420712443753">2</xref></sup> and in general, it is used in the transportation industries. In the latter, in the past years, several new joining technologies were introduced with the aim of manufacturing lightweight parts and vehicles. Therefore, the SPR technique offers a solution to the automotive industry as the increasing use of lightweight aluminium alloys for automobile body-in-white applications needs to be balanced against the well-known problems characterizing spot-welding processes of aluminium alloys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464420712443753">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464420712443753">4</xref></sup> In the latter cited papers, an overview of the joining techniques in the transportation industries is given, highlighting the potential failures which can arise.</p>
<p>Since the actual riveted joints in a vehicle can be made of different materials and can undergo complex loading conditions, any SPR strength characterization must also consider different material combinations and loading conditions. It is important for the automotive design engineers to understand the mechanical behaviours of SPR joints and to take into account the static, impact and fatigue strength of these joints in the design of the whole assembly or vehicle. This technique creates the connection between two structural components through a plastic deformation process. In other words, the rivet is pressed, under the action of a considerable load (40 kN), against the elements to be connected; by drilling in this way, the material of the upper plate that ends with the warp in the bottom is held in place by the action of a die.</p>
<p>In the SPR process, there is no need to pre-drill holes for the sheets to be joined in contrast to the classic riveting process.</p>
<p>In Bokhari,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464420712443753">5</xref></sup> the process mechanics is described together with the necessary equipment; furthermore, in Di Lorenzo and Landolfo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464420712443753">6</xref></sup> and Fu and Mallick,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464420712443753">7</xref></sup> the effect of the most relevant process variables is shown considering as objective function the shear resistance of the obtained joints. It should be observed that the riveting process is made as a single operation. There are many variables in a riveted connection, which must be considered in order to get an accurate study to fully understand the structural behaviour of such connections and maximize its mechanical resistance. Experimental tests on joints made by SPR compared with other types of connections show the influence of some process parameters on static and fatigue behaviours of joints in an aluminium alloy. Parameters influencing the mechanical behaviour of the joints are the geometric characteristics of the joint, number and size of the rivets, distance from the edges, thickness of the sheets and also process parameters such as the die pressure, pre-clamping force and die shape, as shown in Pickin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464420712443753">8</xref></sup> and Porcaro et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464420712443753">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the past years, there have been a few studies on the static and fatigue properties of SPR joints. Krause and Chernenkoff<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464420712443753">10</xref></sup> conducted fatigue tests to compare the performance of SPR joints vis-a-vis spot-welded joints in 2 mm thick aluminium alloy blanks. Their study shows that the SPR joints perform much better in fatigue tests, in fact at 10<sup>6</sup> cycles, the fatigue strength of SPR joints is twice that of spot-welded joints. Hahn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464420712443753">11</xref></sup> considered fatigue performances of SPR joints as well as a combination of SPR and adhesive bonding in aluminium alloy with various surface pre-treatments and coatings. Their studies show that the combination produced a much stronger joint than the rivets themselves in both static and fatigue tests. Fu and Mallick<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464420712443753">12</xref></sup> studied the effects of rivet and die dimensions on the static and fatigue properties of SPR joints in an aluminium alloy.</p>
<p>Also, the fatigue behaviour of the joints was investigated (see, for instance, works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464420712443753">13</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464420712443753">15</xref></sup>). In addition, the possibility of joining dissimilar materials was considered by Abe et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464420712443753">16</xref></sup> and Sun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464420712443753">17</xref></sup>: this latter opportunity makes the SPR technique particularly effective without any metallurgical shortcoming.</p>
<p>Overall, on the basis of the available scientific literature, it can be stated that the development of an effective joint must meet certain fundamental conditions:
<list id="list1-1464420712443753" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the surface of the rivet head should appear parallel to the surface sheet (certain geometric conditions between rivet head and sheet must be guaranteed);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the die does not generate cracks on sheet.</p></list-item>
</list>There are also some disadvantages related to the use of this joining technique:
<list id="list2-1464420712443753" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>possibility of galvanic corrosion between metal plates of different materials and sheet metals and rivet;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>weight gain due to the presence of the rivet itself.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Also, some variations with respect to the traditional SPR process were proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464420712443753">18</xref></sup> by adding to the well-known process mechanics further plastic deformation to the joint after its development in order to increase the mechanical fastening effect.</p>
<p>In addition, this research, as already mentioned, has been conducted to study the static and fatigue behaviours of hybrid joints (metal/composite) using SPR process, highlighting the lack of relevant knowledge in this specific field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464420712443753">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464420712443753">20</xref></sup> In particular, Di Franco et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464420712443753">20</xref></sup> presented preliminary results regarding the static behaviour of metal–composite joints obtained through the SPR process.</p>
<p>In this article, a comprehensive experimental and numerical approach is developed in order to highlight the mechanisms involved in the SPR process of aluminium blanks and carbon fibre composite panels, with the aim of setting up a powerful tool for joint engineering. In particular, a few case studies were considered by varying the process parameters. The strength of joints obtained was tested using static and fatigue tests under tensile load spectrum; the appropriate macro analyses of the cross sections of the joints, to evaluate the quality of the riveting process, were also carried out.</p>
<p>Experimental results were also combined with the ones derived from a finite element method (FEM) model in order to analyse the mechanisms of joint formation and mechanical fastening and to carry out a proper process engineering, with the final aim of maximizing the mechanical performance of the joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464420712443753">21</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464420712443753">23</xref></sup></p>

<p>The mechanical connection is realized through austenitic stainless steel rivets with countersunk flat produced by Henrob Ltd Company. The Fastriv designation for the rivets used in the experimental activity is FBC4865001A01; this type of self-piercing rivets is designed to join sheets that have a total thickness of 4–5 mm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464420712443753">Figure 1</xref> shows the geometry of the rivet–die.

<p>The aluminium alloy was AA2024-T6 received in 1 × 2 m<sup>2</sup> blanks of 2.7 mm thickness. From the aluminium alloy sheet and carbon fibre composite panels, 25 × 100 mm<sup>2</sup> specimens were obtained and used for the SPR process.</p>
<p>The aluminium blanks were also tested through tensile tests, obtaining a yield stress of 350 MPa and an ultimate tensile stress of 440 MPa and showing an elastic Young modulus of 65,800 MPa.</p>
<p>In order to obtain the composite layer, an epoxy resin (C.SYSTEM 1010 CFS ‘A’, Cecchi), a cure agent (C.SYSTEM 1010 CFS ‘B’, Cecchi) and carbon fibre type BATAVIA 0°/90° with a superficial density of 200 g/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464420712443753">Figure 2</xref>) were used. The sequence of packing was [0°/±45°]<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> and the final thickness of carbon fibre composite panels 1.5 mm. The composite materials were obtained by vacuum bagging to prevent the air inclusions and improve the density of the layers of fibre in order to increase the mechanical strength of the laminate. The composite panels underwent a depression of 0.8 atm for 8 h, were cured at about 20 °C for 16 h and finally were heated at 60 °C for 12 h. From the composite panel and the aluminium sheet, specimens with dimensions 25 × 150 mm<sup>2</sup> were obtained.

<p>In order to minimize coupon bending and ensure alignment of the load paths, end tabs (shims) of various thicknesses were used at both ends of the lap shear samples to balance the thickness differences of the two gripped regions such that a minimum bending moment is applied to the joint area. Dimensions for the specimens used in the lap shear tests are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1464420712443753">Figure 3</xref>.

<p>In order to get some information regarding the elastic properties of the obtained composite panels, some preliminary tensile tests were carried out. The ASTM D3039/3039 M-93 standard was used to determine the mechanical properties of the composite materials. An average Young modulus of 28.1 GPa was obtained.

<p>Static tension tests aimed to determine the shear strength of the joints were conducted on a 50 ton Instron machine with a load cell of ±30 kN. The tests were conducted by setting a constant crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min; such a low value of the head speed was chosen in order to follow the evolution of the tests in detail.</p>
<p>Previous studies about the possibility to join metallic and composite materials have shown that to obtain a greater joint strength, the composite panel should be located at the top of the joint and the aluminium alloy sheet at the bottom.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464420712443753">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fatigue tests were carried out on a series of joints obtained with an oil pressure of 300 bar, the one corresponding to the best static resistance of the investigated joint.</p>
<p>Load-controlled fatigue tests were performed on an MTS servo hydraulic testing machine using a sinusoidal waveform and in a tension–tension mode. The ratio of the minimum load to the maximum one or <italic>R</italic>-ratio was 0.1 and the test frequency 15 Hz in all the tests; the specimens were tested until visible failure occurred. In order to reduce the bending deformation of the joints due to the lap specimens, 1 mm thick aluminium end tabs were taped at each end of the specimens. The specimens were placed in the grips of the testing machine with 25 mm length at each end clamped between the serrated jaws of the grips. In the fatigue tests carried out with a constant amplitude load, the maximum load was set at five different load levels.

<p>A total of 25 tensile tests were conducted in order to determine the maximum peak load by changing the oil pressure of the riveting system. Five tensile tests were carried out for each type of specimen in order to verify the repeatability of the obtained results. Each type of specimen presented a different load vs displacement curve with a different peak load.</p>
<p>The load–displacement histories were recorded during tests and the displacement measured from the machine was representative of the displacement of the test specimen. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1464420712443753">Figure 4</xref> shows typical load–displacement curves for the specimen (equipment oil pressure of 300 bar); in the curves, an increase of the load value is found out until the maximum load is transferred by the joint. The latter depends on the pressure of the riveting process used to create the joint between the composite material and the aluminium sheet.
<fig id="fig4-1464420712443753" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Load vs displacement (equipment oil pressure of 300 bar).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712443753-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>After the maximum value is reached, the measured load decreases to a plateau until complete failure of the joint is reached. The latter effect is due to the growth of the fracture cracks of the composite layer close to the rivet. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420712443753">Figure 5</xref> shows the interpolation of the values of the maximum load obtained experimentally as a function of the oil pressure during the riveting process. It is possible to deduce that the optimum riveting pressure to make the joint is 300 bar, at which there is the maximum value of the transmitted load. As expected, the mechanical behaviour of the joint is strictly influenced by the riveter oil pressure. This fact is due to the force applied in the riveting process which determines a different deformation of the rivet, composite panel and aluminium alloy blank within the die. In particular, with increase in the oil pressure in the riveting system, the mechanical fastening between the composite panel and the aluminium blank enhances. It should be observed that as a pressure threshold is reached, some cracks are impressed by the rivet head action during the SPR process on the composite panel; such cracks reduce the joint mechanical resistance.
<fig id="fig5-1464420712443753" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>The maximum load vs oil pressure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712443753-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1464420712443753">Figure 6</xref>, the macro image of the transverse section of a riveted joint obtained with an oil pressure of 300 bar is shown. The rivet penetrates the carbon fibre composite panel and then deforms the aluminium blank against the die. It should be noticed that the composite material is blocked inside the rivet, and such material does not plastically deform, limiting as a consequence the plastic deformation of the rivet itself. The experimental evidence highlights that – at least for the investigated values of the equipment oil pressure – the best mechanical fastening mechanism is obtained for the equipment oil pressure of 300 bar.
<fig id="fig6-1464420712443753" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>The transverse section of riveted joints.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712443753-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>All the considered specimens presented the same failure mode. The failure mechanism observed for the investigated hybrid joints was basically the bearing one, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1464420712443753">Figure 7</xref>. The latter depends on the ratio between the rivet diameter and the specimen’s width. When the joint starts to be damaged, the rivet head enters the laminate, cutting the carbon fibre around the hole. In particular, the laminate bends under the action of the rivet head until the carbon fibre composite panel is pulled out.
<fig id="fig7-1464420712443753" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>The bearing failure mechanism.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712443753-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The rivet is more rigid than the sheets and it applies a compressive force that leads to damage in the contact area: the rivet head penetrates the upper sheet and material of the lower sheet is pushed ahead of the rivet, forming a relief on the sheet surface. The average maximum shear load was 3600 N, making the SPR process competitive.</p>
<p>The failure mechanism observed for the investigated hybrid joints was fundamentally the bearing one, highlighting the good interaction and clamping mechanics between the rivet itself and the two parts to be joined, namely the aluminium blank and the composite panel. In static tests, the failure occurred only in the upper sheet (composite panels).</p>

Also, it should be observed that a scattering of the results was obtained. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1464420712443753">Figure 9</xref>, the Wőhler curve is shown. The experimental tests showed large values of fatigue strength of the joint, even for values of imposed loads close to the static tensile strength; in turn, as already mentioned, a quite large scattering of the results was observed.

<p>In this way, a further research activity is required in order to definitively highlight the fatigue characteristics and resistance of the investigated joint.</p>
<p>Failure modes under repeated loading of the single-rivet joints are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1464420712443753">Figure 10</xref>(a) and (b). Two modes were observed:

<list-item><p>debonding of composite panels which occurred due to cracking of the top substrate around the rivet head in the area where it folded to accommodate rivet punching during the SPR process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1464420712443753">Figure 10</xref>(a));</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>net section cracking of the aluminium sheet was observed for a fatigue life over 200,000 cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1464420712443753">Figure 10</xref>(b)); the crack, caused by the fatigue load, propagated across the blank, perpendicular to the loading direction.</p></list-item>

<p>In this way, a relation can be set up between the fatigue life and, in particular, the load level during the fatigue tests and the failure mode of the joints. Especially, cracking of the top substrate of the composite panel around the rivet head was observed for a fatigue life under 200,000 cycles, i.e. for large values of fatigue load; in turn, net section cracking of the aluminium sheet was found out as low values of fatigue loads were applied.</p>
<p>The failure of the riveted joint during fatigue tests then localized either in the aluminium blank or in the composite panel, while during the static tests, the failure occurred in the composite layer.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1464420712443753"><title>Numerical modelling</title>
<p>Numerical simulations of the SPR process were done using the finite element code DEFORM™ (two-dimensional (2D) version). The FEM analyses were aimed to highlight the process mechanics as hybrid joints are considered. In particular, a 2D axisymmetric model was generated including the two sheets to be joined, the rivet and the tool. Dies were modelled as rigid contact surfaces while rivet and sheets as deformable parts.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the effect of the element dimension on the simulation of the process mechanics, a sensitivity analysis was carried out, varying the average dimension of the elements used in the FEM model. The final configuration after four different trials is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1464420712443753">Figure 11</xref>. The finer the mesh, the earlier the deformation limit was reached and the element destroyed.

<p>A correct identification of the contact condition for all sliding parts and especially at the rivet–sheet interface is key to the success of the simulation.</p>

<p>The numerical cross section showed good features: proper rivet leg thickening and flaring and a complete die filling. This last characteristic is particularly interesting since it plays a fundamental role in the mechanical behaviour of the rivet. A very good agreement was found between numerical predictions and experimental verifications, which gives confidence on the numerical model reliability. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1464420712443753">Figure 13</xref>, the force–displacement curve is compared with the corresponding experimental one in three steps of the process. As the punch stroke increases, the load increases, particularly a sharp increase was observed in the end stage. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1464420712443753">Figure 14</xref>, the maximum principal stresses in the carbon fibre composite panels and the aluminium blank are shown at the end of the riveting process.

<p>It can be observed that the simulation is able to capture the key phases of the joining process: the filling of the rivet hole and then the flaring. The model reached an appropriate level of detail and approximation in reproducing the complex multi-physics of the riveting process.</p>
<p>It should be observed that further developments are necessary on the numerical simulation of the proposed hybrid joints riveting. First of all, a more detailed description and modelling of the composite material behaviour must be introduced also considering the actual disposition, i.e. the direction of the fibres in the panel. Also, contact issues must be properly investigated in order to effectively reproduce the process conditions. Finally, the used mesh density is a further numerical aspect to be considered and properly tuned in order to get effective results. It should be observed that a finer mesh would assure better contact conditions, starting from the rivet–blank interface, and as a consequence, a more regular trend of the calculated load vs displacement curve would be obtained (see again <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1464420712443753">Figure 13</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec9-1464420712443753" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The need for new joining methods to join composite material increases as well as the employment of this kind of new material. According to this technique, this article had the purpose to evaluate the possibility to join two different materials such as carbon fibre laminate and an aluminium alloy using SPR joints. The most relevant findings highlighted in this article are recalled.
<list id="list4-1464420712443753" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Preliminary static tests showed that the mechanical behaviour is strictly influenced by the oil pressure magnitude of the electro-hydraulic riveting system. The failure of the joint presented the same characteristics for all the static tests carried out: the head of the rivet entered the hole, cutting the carbon fibre until the failure of the joints.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In addition, a series of fatigue tests at different load levels were carried out. It should be observed that the cycles vs displacement curves presented a similar trend for all the tested specimens. There is a steep field followed by a linear field and another steep field in which the joint breaks. Failure modes of the joint in fatigue tests were observed: in particular, two different modes were observed, namely cracking of the top substrate of the composite panel around the rivet head and net section cracking of the aluminium sheet. The former mode was observed for a fatigue life under 200,000 cycles, i.e. for large values of fatigue load, while the latter was found out as low values of fatigue loads were applied.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The riveting process was examined through a FEM analysis which offered convergent result to the experimental process, presenting almost identical load vs displacement curves. Eventually, crack propagation mode, trunk deformation and die filling were correctly reproduced. An overall good agreement with experimental results was found in terms of joint cross-sectional shape and force–displacement curve. The presented approach to the modelling of the process can be improved by adjusting the mesh size and the overall material modelling. Also, the used approach to model the crack propagation mode during the process (i.e. the fracture criterion) can be improved, permitting to avoid typical discontinuities in the load vs displacement curves.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>This article demonstrated that hybrid joints between carbon fibre laminate sheets and aluminium blanks are truly feasible through the SPR technology. All the process parameters must be chosen accurately in order to achieve the best qualities. It can be concluded that this joining technique will be able to find a number of applications in all industrial fields, which need to employ innovative materials and a cheap and fast joining technique, such as aerospace and aeronautical and automotive industry, which have the need to combine lightweight structures and effective joining techniques.</p>
