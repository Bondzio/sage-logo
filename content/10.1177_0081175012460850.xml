<p>On July 9–10, 2012, Professor Martin Bauer organized a third conference on text mining at the London School of Economics. Invited participants came from computer science and different social science disciplines. They were united by a common interest in texts and the extraction of meaning from those texts. They were divided by the way they approached those texts–-their methods, a marker of more fundamental epistemological differences. Social scientists ranged in their approach. There are the content analysts who rely on CAQDAS packages to deal with text, either qualitatively, employing CAQDAS only as an organizational tool, or quantitatively, querying the codes they produce in CAQDAS for cross-relations, exporting the results, and analyzing these in statistical packages (SPSS, STATA, R), as do <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0081175012460850">Michael White, Maya Judd, and Simone Poliandri (this volume, 2012</xref>:43–76). There are those who distance themselves from the text, relying on semi-automated approaches in the French tradition of <italic>analyse des données</italic> (e.g., using such software as Alceste or Lebart’s Dtm-Vic). The larger the body of text to be analyzed, the more likely social scientists are to look for automatic, quantitative solutions. And that’s where social and computer scientists meet. The textual analysis tools that computer science data miners have developed tend to work well only when dealing with “millions of words,” as Professor Nello Cristianini, a computer scientist at Bristol, UK, put it at the conference: “Modern AI is driven by large text corpora.” Their algorithms do allow them to reveal important properties of content, whether about topic, style, or even narrative structure. It is that narrative structure (the sequence of SVO of actors and their actions), that I painfully extract from text by hand, in my Quantitative Narrative Analysis approach—an approach that falls squarely in the category of those who treat text qualitatively but analyze the results quantitatively. Contrary to purely qualitative scholars, I am hoping (and optimistic) that computer scientists will one day put us out of our misery of hand coding.</p>
<p>Thus, ultimately, I share what the authors write about CAQDAS approaches: that “the researcher always has ready access to the underlying qualitative data (e.g., original text)” (p. 48) and that “quantitative and qualitative analytical processes can be employed iteratively and interactively, allowing the researcher to identify emergent themes and insights, and ultimately produce <italic>results difficult to achieve using one method alone</italic>” (emphasis added, p. 61). I have stressed that same point in several publications and use it (effectively?) as a research strategy in my contribution to this symposium.</p>
<p>I share their view that quantitative analyses of textual material (yet, is a network graph or a GIS map <italic>really</italic> quantitative?) “allow us to observe patterns of response difficult to see using the qualitative software alone” (p. 60). After all, that is the purpose of data analysis (of texts) for social scientists: to draw inferences not about texts as such but of some social reality they represent. In that, we fundamentally differ from linguists, literary critics, and rhetoricians who look at texts <italic>qua</italic> texts.</p>
<p>Finally, I share their pessimistic conclusion that “the advancement of mixed methods and related design has been more elusive than one might otherwise imagine” (p. 61). And for good reasons, speaking from experience. I still remember my bewilderment (and embarrassment, how could I not know this?) at an ASA meeting back in the 1980s. When talking about my project to Roger Gould (<italic>sit tibi terra levis!</italic>) and about my plan to use regression and logistic models for data analysis, he said: “That’s fine. But your data are perfect for network models.” Network models? I had never heard of such things, <italic>despite</italic> my training as a statistician/econometrician. And none of my colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, perhaps the most methodologically sophisticated sociology department in the United States at the time, ever suggested network models to me. If anything, some of them were asking: “What’s Franzosi gonna do with thousands of words in the computer?” It is perhaps ironic that today’s computer scientists should need “millions of words” in their computers. And I certainly still remember the (ongoing) painful climb to learn linguistics and, later, rhetoric. After all, this is what Aaron Cicourel wrote that I <italic>should</italic> focus on rather than Artificial Intelligence in the first review of my “From Words to Numbers” approach (1989, in this same journal). Linguistics? What was that? Indeed, I do wonder what linguists and rhetoricians would think about the social and computer scientists’ dabbling with texts. Alas, they were not present at the conference. Next time!</p>
<p>One can come away from these meetings with the feeling of having been involved in a dialogue if not among deaf, at least among skeptics or, better yet, among scholars who live in different worlds and simply do not understand each other—one good reason for the dialogue to continue, if we want to learn each other’s language, each other’s culture. But also with a feeling of hope, a feeling I first experienced in a whirlwind tour across Europe during the summer of 2012 teaching workshops on QNA. Workshop participants, even when open to a nonqualitative treatment of their data, were often at a loss for information. What’s to be done “with thousands of words in the computer?” The range of tools required, in methodological (and software) expertise, is beyond the tool kit of the average social scientist. Most sociology departments still rely on quantitative training based on standard regression, with a few variants of log-linear modeling, multilevel modeling, or categorical data analysis. But, at least in narrative analysis, the tools required are more likely to be network models (to map the relations between actors via their actions), sequence analysis (to highlight any invariant sequential pattern of actions across events), or even the even more esoteric (for us) GIS tools (geographic information systems, to map in space and time actors’ actions). It is <italic>imperative</italic>, for the sake of a broader adoption of mixed-method approaches, that software developers <italic>directly</italic> connect data results produced in their software with other types of software (particularly open-source software) and with online help on what to do when the software opens up and users find themselves in unfamiliar territory. But if they like what they see, users are likely to become more adventurous and explore the territory. This will at least give the uninformed user an idea of what else is possible. As the authors say: “With the advent of new software, qualitative and mixed-methods approaches may represent a significant opportunity to augment knowledge. . . . It should be easy to brighten this bulb” (p. 66). We can only hope. Unless, as Elton wrote about traditional and scientific historians, qualitative and quantitative historians, we are happy that “each will go to heaven his own way” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081175012460850">1983</xref>:83).</p>
