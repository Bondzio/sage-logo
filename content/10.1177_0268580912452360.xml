<abstract>
<p>These books explore new territories in the scholarly debate on Islamophobia. Each offers a slightly different understanding of the term. However, neither offers a definition and typology that can help scholars to utilize the term ‘Islamophobia’ as a variable in theorizing its causes and consequences. It remains unclear how one can empirically identify and measure the variation of Islamophobia across societies and over time in order to suggest policies to combat it.</p>

<p>The term ‘Islamophobia’ has become commonplace in public discourse in the last decade. Still, scholars hotly contest the term’s meaning and empirical validity. The books reviewed here are rather different in terms of their scope and method but collectively they advance the scholarship on Islamophobia as a concept and public policy issue. However, I do not yet see how the term can be used to compare the level and causes of anti-Muslim and anti-Islamic attitudes and incidents across societies and over time and to develop policies to combat these attitudes and incidents. It seems that the contestation over the term will continue.</p>
<p>Allen’s <italic>Islamophobia</italic> sets out to define Islamophobia as a term that is analytically sound and empirically useful. While Allen’s primary aim is conceptual, he also discusses whether Islamophobia can be traced back into history or is it a relatively new reality. The historical camp provides three historical origins for it: early Christian polemics on the origins of Islam and Islamic expansion; Christian rhetoric in the period of the crusades; and European imperialist and racist discourse during the nineteenth-century colonial encounter. Those who claim that Islamophobia denotes a new social reality claim that contemporary anti-Islamic and anti-Muslim events, incidents, discourse are the result of several relatively recent factors like the 9/11 attacks. Allen splits the differences: ‘history clearly informs, shapes, and provides a frame of reference for understanding without insisting that all such manifestations of anti-Muslim, anti-Islamic phenomena are constant and unchanging’ (p. 34).</p>
<p>To define Islamophobia, Allen further examines the term’s origins and evolution. While its exact genealogy is disputed, its contemporary reformulation is undeniably grounded in the sociopolitical climate of Britain in the 1990s; it was there that Islamophobia was first recognized as a distinct reality and the British Runnymede Report fixed the term’s meaning. Two factors may account for Britain’s special role. First, the Race Relations Act of 1976, which initially did not provide any protection to religious communities, was extended in the 1980s to include mono-ethnic religious communities, i.e., Jews and Sikhs. This extension, which provided these communities a degree of legal protection from anti-Semitic and anti-Sikh hate speech, triggered some early Muslim demand for similar protections. Second, for Muslims, the negative consequences related to the lack of legal protections became more apparent in the political environment surrounding Khomeini’s infamous fatwa against the author Salman Rushdie, when a slew of anti-Muslim and anti-Islamic discourse surfaced in public debates and in the media. This experience further mobilized Islamic groups for legal protection similar to Jews and Sikhs.</p>
<p>In this political environment, the British Runnymede Trust Commission – a policy think tank with a focus on race relations and multiculturalism – was central to the emergence of the term ‘Islamophobia’. The Commission’s conceptualization of Islamophobia, surprisingly, first came out of its 1994 study on anti-Semitism, which alluded to a distinct anti-Islamic and anti-Muslim phenomenon using the term ‘Islamophobia’. Later, its 1997 report <italic>Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All</italic> furnished the term with its contemporary meaning. To the Commission, Islamophobia is ‘the dread, hatred and hostility towards Islam and Muslims perpetuated by a series of closed views that imply and attribute negative and derogatory stereotypes and beliefs to Muslims’. This definition was further shortened, so that Islamophobia became ‘to fear or dislike all or most Muslims’ (p. 51).</p>
<p>The report further identifies several elements of Islamophobia, focusing on a model of ‘closed’ rather than ‘open’ views of Islam: (1) Islam is seen as monolithic and static rather than diverse and dynamic; (2) Islam is seen as other and separate rather than similar and interdependent; (3) Islam is seen as inferior not different; (4) Islam is seen as an enemy not as a partner; (5) Muslims are seen as manipulative not as sincere; (6) discrimination against Muslims is defended rather than challenged; (7) Muslim criticisms of ‘the West’ are rejected not considered; and (8) anti-Muslim discourse is seen as natural and not problematic. The report concludes that, ‘Islamophobic discourse, sometimes blatant but frequently subtle and coded, is part of the fabric of everyday life in Britain in much the same way that anti-Semitic discourse was taken for granted earlier in the century’ (p. 73).</p>
<p>The Commission’s interfaith ethos, and thus its exclusion of voices deemed radical or unhelpful for interfaith dialogue, turned out to be both its strength and weakness. Not surprisingly, supporters of the report were also supporters of interfaith dialogue. Liberal and interfaith Muslim groups like UKACIA, Pakistan Forum of Britain, and Muslim National Trust supported the report while, at least initially, conservative groups like IHRC, Muslim Parliament, <italic>Muslim News</italic>, and Union of Muslim Organizations criticized it (pp. 55–56). A similar polar reaction also existed in other faith communities: the Churches Commission on Inter-Faith Relations welcomed the report while the evangelical London Bible College criticized it on the grounds that the report did not address the challenge that Islam is posing to Britain. The College increased its criticism of the Islamophobia Report by countering with a report of its own: <italic>The Westphobia Report: Anti-Western and Anti-Christian Stereotyping in British Muslim Publications</italic> (p. 59).</p>
<p>The term itself has drawn much criticism. Some argued that, unlike historical examples, the contemporary fear and hatred of Muslims has very little to do with fear and hatred of Islam as a faith that the term <italic>Islam</italic>ophobia invokes (p. 74). Some others claimed that the term’s description of Islamophobic discourse and actions also appear in extremist Muslim circles, suggesting, paradoxically, that radical Muslims are Islamophobic (p. 79). Also some others hold that the problem with Islamo<italic>phobia</italic> is that it invokes a biological, natural, or cultural pathology that needs ‘to be cured’ (p. 136). These critiques also offered alternative terms: anti-Muslimism, anti-Muslim racism, and anti-Islamic racism. While Allen shares some of the critics’ concerns, he believes that the suggested alternatives are no better, and an advantage Islamophobia has is that it has already ‘acquired a reasonable level of discursive permeation in social and public usage’ (p. 139).</p>
<p>While not willing to give up on the term Islamophobia, Allen is very critical of the Commission’s approach to Islamophobia. He best articulates this point in his chapter ‘Islamophobia: From K.I.S.S. to R.I.P.’ in <italic>Thinking through Islamophobia</italic>, where he faults the Commission’s simplistic approach for failing to explain how to distinguish Islamophobic discrimination from other types of discrimination like racism or class-based discrimination. This failure allowed two opposite approaches in documenting Islamophobia. First, skeptics rejected religious discrimination and explained discrimination against Muslims as being grounded in other factors, like racism or xenophobia. Second, others labeled any discrimination whatsoever against Muslims as evidence of Islamophobia. Belonging to the latter, and using the Commission’s definition, the organization FAIR posited that the number of Islamophobia incidents increased six-fold immediately after 9/11. For Allen such statistics are flawed because the Commission’s broad conceptualization does not offer a clear baseline by which one could distinguish Islamophobia from other types of discrimination. Empirical data about Islamophobia remain murky because the Commission’s simplified definition makes the motivation, cause, product, and consequence indistinguishable.</p>
<p>For a better definition, in <italic>Islamophobia</italic> Allen first distinguishes Islamophobia-as-process and Islamophobia-as-product. This distinction is important. Discriminatory events (products) suffered by Muslims may or may not be the result of Islamophobia; to verify that such discrimination is Islamophobic it is necessary to show that such discrimination was initiated because of Islamophobic discourse (p. 163). ‘Islamophobia is not then any specific action, practice, discrimination or prejudice but more accurately the meaning disseminated that subsequently shapes, determines and initiates actions, practices, discrimination and prejudices’ (p. 169). The counterpart to this is that the absence of discrimination may not prove the absence of Islamophobia, as anti-Muslim and anti-Islamic ideology may be operational without producing an explicit discriminatory practice.</p>
<p>Allen then identifies three elements of the process to clarify Islamophobia-as-process. First, stereotypification: the process of constructing an ‘evaluative hierarchy’ by attributing and fixing in-group and out-group differences. This process grafts and legitimizes ‘meaning and knowledge about certain groups and individuals’ into the ‘mainstream of societal thought and understanding’ (pp. 140–144). Second, representation: the process of embodying meaning and knowledge within visual signs, like identifying <italic>hijab</italic> with fundamentalism. Third, semiology: the mechanism through which representation is correlated with visual identifiers. Through signs and visual identifiers, meaning and knowledge of a particular group and individuals become part of society’s normative fabric, like identifying people who wear <italic>hijab</italic> with the perpetrator of the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>Building on these, Allen defines Islamophobia as ‘an ideology, similar in theory, function and purpose to racism and other similar phenomena, that sustains and perpetuates negatively evaluated meaning about Muslims and Islam in the contemporary setting in similar ways to that which it has historically, although not necessarily as a continuum, subsequently pertaining, influencing and impacting upon social action, interaction, response and so on, shaping and determining understanding, perceptions and attitudes in the social consensus – the shared languages and conceptual maps – that inform and construct thinking about Muslims and Islam as Other’ (p. 190).</p>
<p>Allen provides a timely analysis about the origins of and debates around ‘Islamophobia’. Admittedly, the conceptual clarity, analytical coherence, and empirical validity are much needed. His attempt to fix the term’s meaning in abstract may be analytically sound, and his distinction between process and product is important. Yet it is not clear how one can empirically distinguish a political statement as a part of process or product. Likewise, it is not clear how one can measure Islamophobia-as-process, or how one can decide if Islamophobia is rising or residing within a given society or across time.</p>
<p>Many contributors, except Cessari, of <italic>Islamophobia: The Challenge of Pluralism in the 21st Century</italic> rely on the Runnymede Trust Commission’s Islamophobia definition uncritically. Concerned with empirical and normative questions, the volume focuses on the growth of Islamophobia in the domestic and foreign policy, media, and culture in the West. While a few contributors introduce original empirical data, most analyze Islamophobia via hate-crime statistics; complaints of anti-Muslim harassment, violence, and discriminatory treatment collected by NGOs and various UN and EU agencies. The contributors extensively use media accounts and polls that document negative feelings, prejudices, and attitudes toward Muslims. A significant amount of empirical evidence remains anecdotal, i.e., quotes from politicians, pundits, Christian leaders and groups, anti-mosque groups, and newspaper editorials.</p>
<p>Best articulated by Kalin, the volume’s normative stand is that Islamophobia is essentially a manifestation of anti-pluralist and racist attitudes in the West and it sustains a West-centric illusion by preventing Muslim participation in the Western and global public spheres. Thus Islamophobia systematically marginalizes, disenfranchises, and thus frustrates non-Western communities (p. 17). Arguing that these exclusionary practices violate Muslims’ human rights and threaten the possibility of global coexistence, Kalin appeals to Western liberals to move away from classical liberalism, with its West-centric assumptions and universalizing demands, to a multicultural liberalism that accommodates multicultural realities of Western democracies and international society.</p>
<p>Cassari’s chapter is a good representative of the volume’s empirical approach and message. In her comparative overview of Islamophobia in America and Europe, two differences appear significant. First, unlike American Muslims, European Muslims are mostly immigrants and socioeconomically marginalized; this ‘European underclass’ experiences high unemployment and low education rates (p. 25). Because of this marginalization, Cessari believes, class rather than religion explains much of the discrimination against Muslims. Second, a European understanding of secularism, best illustrated with the French <italic>laïcité</italic>, worsens Islamophobia there because some Muslim practices challenge strict exclusion of religion from the public sphere (p. 39). Thus, while having strong traditions of tolerance and multiculturalism, Europeans fall short to accommodate non-European norms and values (p. 41).</p>
<p>The rest of the chapters are divided into two: cases and manifestations. Some of the case studies cover Islamophobia in the Netherlands, Austria, Germany and the UK. Others compare Islamophobia and anti-Americanism and analyze racism in American Islamophobia. The second section, which presents some fresh data, discusses Islamophobia in relation to Orientalism and imperialism. The main theme is that the process that gave rise to Orientalism in the nineteenth century is also responsible for the rise of Islamophobia now. Essentially, Islamophobia, like Orientalism, is an imperial tool of ‘othering’ that is used to delegitimize ‘the concerns of non-Western societies [and] to legitimize Western military, political, and cultural domination’ (p. 122).</p>
<p>Art, culture, and gender issues are the focus of the last three chapters. Al-Shaikh-Ali argues that the enduring derogatory images of Islam and Muslims found in classical works of art and literature that were produced during the Age of Empires ‘continue to have tremendous influence on Western views, attitudes, and policies towards Muslims’ (p. 147). In this context, Zebiri focuses on the experience of Muslim women. Her interviews with British Muslim converts led Zebiri to argue that the <italic>hijab</italic>, like other visual symbols, provides a stimulus for feelings of hostility because it creates a symbol for what some in the West believe to be the Islamic cultural and moral resistance to Western universalism (p. 186). This hostility has intensified as a result of the rapid changes, increasing diversity, and insecurity brought by globalization. According to Zebiri, the creation of out-group and in-group stereotypes is especially appealing because the representations of Muslims as barbaric, cruel, irrational, backward, repressive of women, irredeemable, and alien and the West as modern, progressive, rational, civilized, humane, and liberal provide a sense of moral superiority in a time of political, economic, and social uncertainty.</p>
<p>Unlike Allen, who finds the term’s ambiguity a liability, the contributors of <italic>Thinking Through Islamophobia: Global Perspectives</italic> embrace its ambiguity. Rather than fixing the meaning of the term in the abstract that in a way Allen advocates, they view it within a particular context by exploring variations of Islamophobia, with particular attention to the variety of Muslim presence and agency in each context (p. 3). The varieties of Islamophobia have overlapping similarities, akin to family resemblances. To explore Islamophobia and its role in defining Muslim presence and political agency in diverse contexts, the editors brought together a geographically and disciplinarily diverse group of contributors (p. 2).</p>
<p>In part as a result of this diversity, the volume discusses Islamophobia in 27 chapters: some lengthy chapters, i.e., longer than 20 pages, construct large and sustained arguments; some brief excursions, as short as three pages, illustrate a particular theme regarding Islamophobia. This wide net reveals some familiar catches – i.e., topics also presented in <italic>Islamophobia: The Challenge of Pluralism in the 21st Century</italic> – but some unfamiliar ones too. For example, Islamophobia appears in some familiar areas, i.e., in neoconservative narratives, debates about face-veiling in the Netherlands, the War on Terror, literature, the British government’s action plan Preventing Violent Extremism, and in some unfamiliar areas, i.e., in the online virtual reality game Second Life, homosexual discourse, the anti-coffee (Turkish) discourse in sixteenth-century London, the Sikh community in the UK, and among soccer fans, adherents to a Hellenophile worldview, and Belgian leftist politicians and intellectuals. In this volume, Islamophobia also appears in familiar geographies, i.e., North America and Western Europe, but also in some unfamiliar geographies, i.e., Russia, China, India, Thailand, Greece (countries with significant minority Muslim communities who are not recent immigrants), and Turkey (a majority Muslim country). Islamophobia also appears in familiar intellectual contexts, i.e., American neoconservativism, Hindutva, Turkish secularism, European racism and xenophobia, but also some unfamiliar ideologies, i.e., liberalism, feminism, and the gay-rights movement.</p>
<p>In addition to a family resemblance, a postcolonial framework unites these amalgams of experiences. These experiences serve to sustain a ‘violent hierarchy’ between the West and Islam; this hierarchy has been challenged, on the one hand, by globalization and the West’s declining power and on the other by the increased presence and agency of Muslims in the West and globally (p. 3). Thus, Islamophobia (as discourse and practice) seeks to discipline Muslim autonomy. It does so via a two-track process. On the one hand, it denies Muslims’ claims to self-definition and political agency. On the other, it labels and devalues the Muslim presence and agency in a framework that privileges Western discourses, interests, and values. Essentially, for many of these contributors, Islamophobia and the response to it are manifestations of a global struggle between the West and Islam.</p>
<p>The volume aims to deepen the conceptual debate by bringing the issue of power to the discussion. Unlike Allen, who seeks an objective definition of Islamophobia, Vakil sees the debates about the definition as part of an ontological struggle over the description of social reality. This struggle can have tremendous implications for discursive, ideological, and legal power. As a result, while the Islamophobic discourse and attitudes construe Islam and Muslims as a problem, the spread and legitimacy of the term Islamophobia as a social category are signs of increasing Muslim agency and power. In effect, Muslims are attempting to reverse current trends by questioning and shaming the discourse and attitudes that construe Islam and Muslims as a problem (pp. 23–24).</p>
<p>A prominent theme in the volume is the local–global connections concerning Islamophobia. Local dynamics are important. The nation-state system and powerful nation-building forces tend to nationalize any frame of reference in the international system. For example, Greek Islamophobia drew on its Ottoman past; for Serbian Islamophobia, the Battle of Kosovo is central; Turkish Islamophobia carries the Kemalist imprint; European Islamophobia often focuses on the ‘in-assimilability of Muslims’ to the requirements of the nation-states; and Hindutva’s Islamophobia is intertwined with struggles over different histories, narratives, and symbols of the Indian subcontinent. All these national framings, however, also have strong transnational and global linkages. For example, Hindutva’s Islamophobia has been significantly shaped by British colonial historiography of India and thus in part reproduces segments of colonial understanding and discourse (p. 32). Or take Yasin Aktay’s analysis of Turkish Islamophobia: ‘Non-Muslim Islamophobia cites this Kemalist Islamophobia as a way of legitimizing their Islamophobia, while many of the tropes of Kemalist Islamophobia are based upon a recycling of themes associated with Western globalized expressions of Islamophobia’ (p. 205). Three factors in particular have shaped Islamophobia as a global phenomenon. First, the nineteenth-century Orientalist discourse has embedded itself within a wide variety of different geographies. Second, the contemporary transnational power of the Western frame of references has had a tremendous influence on the perception of Muslim presence and agency globally. Finally, in diverse national contexts, anxieties about globalization manifest themselves in the form of Islamophobia as Muslim minorities can be imagined as the threatening global other (p. 165).</p>
<p>Collectively, these books explore new territories in terms of scholarly debate on Islamophobia and each offers a slightly different understanding of the term. None, however, offers a definition and typology that can help scholars to utilize the term ‘Islamophobia’ as a variable in theorizing its causes and consequences. Similarly, it is not clear how one can empirically identify and measure the variation of Islamophobia across societies and over time in order to suggest policies to combat Islamophobia.</p>
