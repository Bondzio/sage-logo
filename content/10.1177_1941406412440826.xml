<title>Melinda, 5 years old, lives with both parents and 2 siblings. She’s been referred to your agency for weight management (&gt;97th percentile). Melinda was breastfed for her first 3 months. Ms Catalan transitioned to formula when she thought her milk had “run out.” Ms Catalan introduced solids at 8 months but Melinda had difficulty making the transition to solids. She would gag and refuse foods with coarser textures. To ensure that Melinda is getting real food, Ms Catalan adds pureed foods to formula or milk and widens the nipple. At 5 years of age, Melinda is starting to eat table food with the rest of the family. She still takes 2 bottles of milk at night. Please describe in detail what you do to help this family. What are some of the key problems you have identified? What types of resources are available to help?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Cialone:</speaker>
<p>Melinda has delayed self- feeding skills and oral motor skills. Her mother has adopted inappropriate feeding practices such as putting food in the bottle to make sure that Melinda is “eating enough.” Melinda and her family would benefit from an initial assessment with a registered dietitian to assess her nutritional status. An occupational therapist could provide an oral motor assessment. A family assessment by a social worker could assess how well the family interacts, especially around the issue of feeding Melinda.</p>
<p>As the registered dietitian, I would provide a complete nutrition assessment of Melinda and focus on the concerns of the parent(s). I would try to assess parent(s) knowledge level of age-appropriate feeding skills; if Melinda has siblings, I would learn about their feeding skills and practices.</p>
<p>It’s important to establish a trusting relationship with Melinda’s mom and family. Understanding the cultural, religious, or family influences on Melinda’s feeding history and current practices will be critical. I would also assess Melinda’s awareness of cues for hunger and satiety and the ability of her family to read those cues. A home visit where an observation of family mealtime could occur would be ideal. This would allow insights into the family dynamics during mealtime. A home visit would also offer information about the levels of physical activity by Melinda and other family members in the household.</p>
<p>If it is determined that it is safe to feed age-appropriate foods to Melinda (based on an oral motor assessment completed by an occupational therapist), I would establish goals with Melinda, her mom, and other family members. The overall goal would be to move Melinda toward age-appropriate feeding.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hes:</speaker>
<p>To start, I would commend Ms Catalan for coming to a weight management clinic with her daughter. I would explain to her that we are not here to place blame on her parenting or make her feel guilty. The fact that she has made this appointment means that she is ready to make a change for her family and that is the most encouraging piece for me as a physician. I would acknowledge how wonderful it is that she breastfed Melinda, even if it was only for 3 months.</p>
<p>Clearly, a 5 year old should not be drinking from a bottle. A baby bottle should be weaned by 18 months of age. We have a huge problem in this country that children drink the majority of their calories. Many parents do not realize how many calories come from drinks, whether it is juice or a soda. The fact that Melinda has a problem chewing or eating solids makes this case more difficult. I would have to tease out whether this is a true swallowing issue or is this just a learned behavior.</p>
<p>Assuming that Melinda has no physical impairment preventing her from chewing solids, I would tell her mother that she has to cut out the bottle and the pureed foods cold turkey. Melinda can drink 3 cups of milk per day, provided that she drinks from a cup and the milk is low fat, either 1% or skim. This will give her the vitamin D and calcium she needs but none of the extra calories from whole milk.</p>
<p>If there were a behavioral component, I would recommend using a “star” chart or a positive reinforcement calendar to reward Melinda every time she ate a healthy solid. If she earns a certain number of stars, she could get a non–food reward, such as a sticker, tattoo, or book.</p>
<p>I would also need a detailed food diary. Does Melinda only eat pureed and bottle food at home? What happens when she is at school or without her family? It is important to know who is preparing all of this pureed food as well. I would explain to Ms Catalan that Melinda has gained an enormous amount of weight at such a young age because she received an excessive amount of calories from her food in a bottle. I would reassure her that, during this process, if Melinda skipped a meal or refused to eat a meal, she would be all right. Since Melinda has no problem with liquids, Ms Catalan has to learn to offer her water with each meal.</p>
<p>I am going to assume that there will be somewhat of a struggle during this transition period, but the family has to agree as a whole that they are making this change for Melinda’s health.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Bodison:</speaker>
<p>One of the first areas of concern relate to the difficulty Melinda had in transitioning to solid foods at the age of 8 months. Although it may be typical for children to approach and avoid new foods as they are presented and demonstrate a gag response on occasion, neither of those factors would limit the child’s ability to successfully transition to solid foods. The gagging and unsuccessful transition at such a young age makes me wonder if there are serious sensory sensitivities that are limiting Melinda’s ability to eat textured foods. Abrupt discontinuation of the bottle may not be appropriate. Having the parents complete a sensory history and explore Melinda’s sensory sensitivity during an occupational therapy evaluation could help rule out that concern.</p>
<p>The second issue relates to Melinda’s limited ability to take table food now—at the age of 5. I would expect that she would no longer need bottles or pureed foods at this age.</p>
<p>I would refer Melinda to a nutritionist for support in assessing her current caloric intake and dietary concerns, a pediatrician to monitor her diet-related health concerns (if any), and an occupational therapist to assess her feeding, eating, and swallowing abilities. Specifically, the OT evaluation should assess the sensory and motor components that are critical to successfully chew and swallow age-appropriate foods.</p>
</speech>

<title>Growth History: Melinda doubled her birth weight by 6 months and quadrupled her birth weight by 12 months. Since that point in time she has averaged 10 lbs per year and now weighs 72 lbs with a body mass index (BMI) of 26 (&gt;97th percentile). From your area of expertise, describe how you would discuss the impact of BMI on Melinda’s health and development. What types of evidence-based interventions could you offer to improve her weight status?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Cialone:</speaker>
<p>I would first determine the level of concern of Melinda and her family about her percentile BMI for age and obtain a family history of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemias, diabetes, and so on. Since Melinda is significantly heavier than most 5-year-old children, I would use motivational interviewing to gain insights into the barriers, readiness for family change, and level of concern. I would request permission to consult with Melinda’s primary health care provider to determine prior interventions and/or any medical concerns.</p>
<p>Based on goals established with the family and Melinda, I would educate the family on basic nutrition needs of a 5 year old. Based on a diet history, we would establish mutually agreed on modifications in the current diet; small incremental changes to support family success would be important to achieving long-term weight management for Melinda. After assessing the physical activity behaviors of Melinda and her family, we would again establish mutually agreed on modification in Melinda’s physical activity and encourage family changes to support Melinda’s success. Initial goals would target weight maintenance with some small increments of weight loss.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hes:</speaker>
<p>Using a CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) growth curve of BMI-based on age and sex, I would show Melinda’s mother exactly what a growth curve is. BMI is probably a concept that Ms Catalan is not familiar with. I would explain to her the definition of BMI and how it is calculated and why it is useful to doctors. I would show her the risk groups for overweight and obese, and demonstrate on the graph how Melinda’s BMI is way off of the chart for her age. Sometimes, when the parents see this visual, it clicks better for them.</p>
<p>I would explain what the goal is for Melinda. The ideal goal is that Melinda lose weight, approximately 10% of her weight in 6 months, which would be about 7 lbs. It would also be acceptable that Melinda just stop gaining weight.</p>
<p>At each visit, I would measure Melinda’s waist circumference and track it in her medical chart. Often, children do not lose weight quickly like adults, but they do lose centimeters off of their waist, and they start to see their clothes becoming loose. This is an easy way to show the parents that all their hard efforts for their child to be healthy are paying off. I always mention that the goal of the program is not to look a certain way, skinny or thin, but it is rather for the child to be healthy on the inside.</p>
<p>I would then go on to discuss all the risk factors of childhood obesity. It would be important to discuss what diabetes is and how this excess weight puts Melinda at risk for diabetes. If Melinda has acanthosis nigricans on her physical exam, showing it to her mother makes the concern more tangible. This skin change can illustrate to Ms Catalan that Melinda is already suffering from insulin resistance and a prediabetic state. I would also inquire about Melinda’s family history for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.</p>
<p>Ms Catalan needs to know that obesity puts Melinda at risk for heart disease, stroke, arthritis, menstrual irregularities or polycystic ovarian syndrome, infertility, obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, depression, anxiety, and bullying, in addition to myriad illnesses.</p>
<p>Using the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) 5210 Guidelines, I would educate Ms Catalan and Melinda about the need to eat at least 5 fruits and vegetables per day, less than 2 hours of screen time per day, 1 hour of vigorous exercise per day, and no sweet drinks. I would start out with small steps for this family. If you set out lofty goals that are too drastic for a family, they may lose faith in your plan and not come back for follow-up. I would ask that mom cut out all white carbohydrates from Melinda’s diet, including but not limited to white rice, potatoes, rice cereal, and white bread.</p>
<p>I would educate the family about the importance of a high-fiber diet, lean proteins, and no frying of food. Of course, all this could not be taught in 1 day, but I would give Ms Catalan some handouts on how she can start making these changes. The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) has a tool called The Power of Choice, and I would use this tool to show her mom what a child’s plate should look like and educate her about portion sizes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Bodison:</speaker>
<p>This is not my area of expertise, and I would refer her to a registered dietitian for specific insight into this. But I can say that a BMI of 26 is very high for 5 year old and predisposes her to a multitude of weight-related disorders such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and potentially joint-related stress issues from excessive weight.</p>
<p>As an occupational therapist, I would recommend that she attend community-based activity programs, go on walks with her family 3 times per week, and follow the nutrition recommendations of the registered dietitian.</p>
</speech>

<title>Social History: Melinda lives with both parents and 2 younger siblings. She attends a morning kindergarten program. She spends the afternoon in the care of her 65-year-old great grandmother until her mother arrives home. Childhood obesity is often described as involving the whole family. Please describe strategies that you have used to get other family members involved in helping Melinda. What types of resources are available within your discipline or area?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Cialone:</speaker>
<p>I would ask if I could meet with Melinda’s great grandmother and speak with her kindergarten teacher. I would attempt to engage them in the agreed on plan. I would try to understand Melinda’s great grandmother’s level of concern and explain the need to support Melinda’s health. I would likely ask a social worker to work with me on this effort.</p>
<p>Recognizing and respecting the important role of the great grandmother, I would determine the family’s interest and willingness to use community-based programs that would support Melinda’s weight loss. These include full-day kindergarten programs, after-school care programs in YMCA or Parks and Recreation. Additionally, I would encourage Melinda’s family to enroll in the “Healthy, Fit and Strong” program (NC weight management program led by registered dietitians based in YMCAs). This program provides group nutrition classes to family members and group physical activities for children.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hes:</speaker>
<p>As a provider working in the urban setting of Brooklyn, New York, I deal with this issue daily. I would stress how physical activity is extremely important in helping to reverse prediabetes and can help prevent cardiovascular disease. Many families use older family members or an older babysitter to look after the kids while the parents are working. If the caregiver truly cannot go outside, I would explore whether Melinda could stay at school for an after-school program until mom comes home from work. Sometimes these programs are subsidized or free. Some, but not all of these, programs offer kids a physical activity after school. I would also inquire whether there is a local YMCA, Boys and Girls Club, or a Police Athletic League in the neighborhood. Sometimes these programs actually come to the school and bring the kids to their site for after-school activities.</p>
<p>If there is truly no after-school option, I would recommend that Melinda’s grandmother take her outside for a walk after school daily, so that she would not be outside alone. If there are stairs available, Melinda’s grandmother can make a game of running or walking the stairs repetitively and timing her. Maybe Melinda and her grandmother can walk home from school. If they take the bus or the subway, they can get off 1 or 2 stops earlier to walk a bit more. If the grandmother cannot do this, I would recommend indoor options such as a hula hooping, jump roping, or just dancing indoors. There are bicycles that plug into the television set and allow the child to play educational video games while pedaling. When the pedaling stops, the game goes off. Melinda can be required to pedal the bike while watching her favorite TV show for a half an hour after school per day.</p>
<p>There are other electronic video consoles that have games designed to get children out of their seats and moving. However, these costs can be prohibitive for some families. Scheduling physical activity over the weekend is also important. Whether it is just walking or participating in sports, I would want Melinda less sedentary. Melinda’s family could explore low-cost or free options in their neighborhood.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Bodison:</speaker>
<p>Older caregivers are often reluctant to encourage young children to be active because they may have limited endurance and mobility themselves. Sometimes it is easier for them to limit the child’s activity so that they have less to do and less to worry about (the child’s safety). In addition, older caregivers aren’t always open to providing kid-friendly foods that are nutritionally balanced and tasty for children. They find it is more work to prepare something that the child may more easily consume.</p>
<p>Ms Catalan would benefit from education on the importance of activity and health, and Dr Hes has provided extensive ideas on ways the older adult and Melinda’s family can increase her activity level.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1941406412440826">
<title>Medical History: Melinda’s family has a history of high cholesterol, type II diabetes, and hypertension. Her last visit to the pediatrician was significant for a cholesterol of 210 mg/dL. What other clinical or medical concerns would you like to investigate? Please explain your concerns and how they may affect Melinda in the future.</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Cialone:</speaker>
<p>Melinda is at high risk for developing other hyperlipidemias, type II diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea. The social stigma of being morbidly obese has a high likelihood of having an emotional impact on Melinda and her acceptance by peers.</p>
<p>My focus would be moving Melinda toward healthier choices by implementing incremental changes in physical activity and food choices. Although explaining the risk of chronic disease would be a part of my discussion with the family, I do not feel that the threat of this would necessarily motivate them to change.</p>
<p>Weight loss over time would reduce Melinda’s risk of these chronic diseases and would likely reduce her cholesterol.</p>
<p>Recommended behaviors changes would focus on the following:</p>
<p><list id="list1-1941406412440826" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Increased physical activity by engaging Melinda and her family in safe and enjoyable activities</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Decrease of sweetened beverages and increased intake of water</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Integration of lower fat choices within the cultural and food preferences of the family</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increase family mealtime at home</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increase intake of fruits and vegetables</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Limit sweet and high-fat snacks</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hes:</speaker>
<p>Most important, a thorough physical exam is needed. I would search for acanthosis nigricans, striae of the skin, note the Tanner staging, and look for any other skin rashes or break down that are often associated with obesity. Many obese children have early signs of puberty due to the estrogen effects of the excess fat and the hormonal effects from the adipokines.</p>
<p>Depending on the patient’s weight and risk factors, I would draw labs to screen for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, anemia, and perhaps hypothyroidism (only if her percentile for height for age on the growth curve was very low). For Melinda, I would order the following tests:</p>
<p><list id="list2-1941406412440826" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Complete blood count</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Liver function tests</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fasting: glucose level, insulin level, and lipid profile</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hemoglobin A1C</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Urinalysis</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Ensure that her blood pressure was measured with a proper-sized cuff for an obese child. An ill-fitting cuff may deliver inaccurate readings.</p>
<p>Based on her elevated total cholesterol, I would start her on a pediatric dosage of omega 3 fish oil supplement. If Melinda were anemic, an iron supplement would also be warranted. The fact that she has consumed so much whole milk may have interfered with her iron absorption.</p>
<p>Finally, it would be important to tie all these physical findings and lab tests back to the comorbidities discussed in the previous section regarding BMI status, as they are all linked together.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Bodison:</speaker>
<p>In addition to BMI, I would be concerned about her heart rate during strenuous activity and joint integrity over time given her lack of exercise and BMI. She needs to lose weight and get moving to improve her health and ensure her muscles and joints are developing adequately. If she remains sedentary, her joint integrity will be challenged by everyday walking and climbing activities from the excessive weight. I would also be concerned about the health of her teeth. If she continues to receive bottles at night, this means that her teeth and gums are exposed to sugars left behind by the bottles that can cause gum and tooth disease. She should see a pediatric dentist to monitor her oral health.</p>

<list-item><p>Implement strategies to increase initiation and duration of breastfeeding. Breastfed infants and children have a lower risk of obesity. This along with other long-term benefits to both the mom and infant makes breastfeeding the best start for all children.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Implement nutrition and physical activity standards in child care and schools with the state.

<speaker>Hes</speaker>
<p><list id="list4-1941406412440826" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Limit or completely stop the intake of sweetened drinks and juice. Children do not need juice. This is a misconception in many cultures. As a pediatrician working in an inner city we see hundreds of children a day coming into the office drinking juice or “sweetened drinks” in their baby bottles or sippy cups. I would recommend to the parents to stop all juice for their children and offer water or milk (whole milk or low fat depending on the age &gt;2 years). I would highly recommend that the child eat fruit and drink water. This would eliminate many excess calories from their diet and improve their overall health and appetite for solid foods.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I would try to work in the community to ensure that children from day care through high school get 1 hour of vigorous exercise a day. This has been a passion of mine since residency, and I have worked tirelessly with schools and community centers to offer low-cost or free programs to children to exercise in a safe venue. There are great opportunities for partnerships between health care systems and community programs such as the YMCA.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As many of our patients received their nutrition via the public school system, I would try to improve the quality of the school food plan. Currently, our New York City schools offer free breakfast and lunch to children from low-income families. Other children pay for their school food, but they are all offered the same menu. Despite the small improvements made in the school food program, the breakfasts are primarily starch-based such as pancakes, waffles, and muffins. Even if a yogurt or healthy whole grain cereal is offered, children are not often savvy enough to make the healthy choice without their parents being present. The quality of the lunch is often very poor and does not offer fresh fruits or vegetables. It relies on too many processed foods and white starches such as potatoes as the only vegetable option. Advocacy needs to be done by the health care providers on the local, state, and federal levels to make these changes happen.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Overcome childhood passivity—too many children sit in front of the TV and snack rather than playing outside or in active games within the home. The occupational therapist can work with the family and child to institute changes in habits and routines to improve everyone’s activity levels. The occupational therapist could teach the children the skills they need to be active and help the family find adapted community-based programs in which to participate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Educate about sensory defensiveness—sometimes children who have obesity, struggle with their food choices because they have aversions to the way some foods feel in their mouth. Often, the foods that are problematic are fruit and vegetable textures. Children with sensitivities tend to prefer crunchy, carbohydrate-based foods that are often high in salts and fat (chips, crackers, breads, etc). By addressing the sensitivity that some children have with foods, the occupational therapist can help expand the child’s food repertoire and support healthier food choices.■</p></list-item>
