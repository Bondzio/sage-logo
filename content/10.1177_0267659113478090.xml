<speech>
<speaker>MR. JOSHUA WALKER (San Antonio, Texas):</speaker>
<p>Are you going to switch to using the Quadrox-i?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. RICHARD M. GINTHER, Jr. (Dallas, Texas):</speaker>
<p>Our team has not decided and that is why we are doing a side-by-side evaluation right now with the Terumo oxygenator. We are still using a Terumo oxygenator on a daily basis.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. IAN SHEARER (Durham, North Carolina):</speaker>
<p>Our pediatric team evaluated this oxygenator and encountered difficulties when it was used during profound hypothermia. The cardiotomy filter could not handle suction blood flow without requiring a venous reservoir change-out. This issue is something to note and I would recommend you evaluate any of those profound extremes that might be encountered during clinical use.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. GINTHER:</speaker>
<p>I heard about that concern from speaking with your colleague, Greg Smigla. It is actually interesting to note that there is a manufacturer’s rating for the cardiotomy inlet flow. I did not realize this issue is something you need to consider. If you have high cardiotomy flow, especially if you are using vacuum, you could possibly pressurize the cardiotomy reservoir.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. JOHN TOOMASIAN (Ann Arbor, Michigan):</speaker>
<p>You generated a large amount of data. What does it mean and how does it compare? I have had the experience of taking a device through Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance. The FDA has established a guidance document and it has many criteria, including heat exchanger efficiency. Manufacturers take a predicate device, which is one that has already been cleared by the FDA, and test it side-by-side with their new product. They follow the guidance document to generate values for vO<sub>2</sub> and vCO<sub>2</sub>. They can then compare data from the new device and submit to the FDA proof that it is substantially equivalent to the predicate device. What it really means is that here is a large amount of data showing CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> transfer per minute that is similar to something that is already on the market. What does that mean to you as a user? It really does not mean anything other than it is comparable to something that is already on the market. What you are doing in this study is an informal <italic>in vivo</italic> test. You actually collect these data under tightly controlled conditions on the bench top. You actually measure CO<sub>2</sub> production using a capnograph and then calculate the oxygen transfer as well. I commend you for what you are doing. I think your study is the closest thing I have seen described as a validation of what is typically done on the bench top. So, you should continue to do what you are doing, but just be aware that it is all done under very controlled conditions. The FDA guidance document is dated, by the way. It does not require animal testing, although oftentimes industry will tell you that they provide <italic>in vitro</italic> animal data when trying to obtain approval from the FDA.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. KEVIN CHARETTE (Piermont, New York):</speaker>
<p>We also used that oxygenator and found that it was adequate. We actually liked the oxygenator. We did not really test the reservoir, but, just ergonomically, we did not like it very much because it comes down to that cone. You cannot see it very well. It is interesting how there is always some other aspect discovered during clinical use and you sometimes wonder, “Why did they do that?” The holder for the oxygenator and reservoir is large. Little things such as these often make a difference in deciding what device to use.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. GINTHER:</speaker>
<p>The reservoir is, theoretically, a great design for air handling. It tapers away from you though and I agree it is difficult to see.</p>

<p>This commentary is taken from the discussion that followed the presentation of the previous paper at the 33rd Annual Seminar of the American Academy of Cardiovascular Perfusion.
