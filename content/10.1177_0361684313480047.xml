<p>
<italic>Gender in the Therapy Hour</italic> is part of a Routledge series of 17 volumes on <italic>Counseling and Psychotherapy with Boys and Men</italic>. Each edited volume focuses on counseling as it relates to a particular issue or subgroup of men. The aim of <italic>Gender in the Therapy Hour</italic> is to address the gap in literature on the topic of female clinicians working with men. Contributors to this volume are an insightful and diverse group of female clinicians with experience in various modalities, ranging from psychodynamic to coaching.</p>
<p>Each chapter includes the clinician’s “personal journey” in the development toward deeper compassion for men and discussion of how her personal relationships with men have impacted her clinical work with male clients. Each author also reflects on the impact of internalized sexism and gender-role norms on herself and her current conceptualization of male clients. For most, there is a critical personal relationship or experience that has led to specialization in working with men. Many have chosen a focus on the psychology of men in order to better “understand the meaning of sexual oppression” (p. 155).</p>
<p>Topics covered in the text include the use of various modalities, issues of transference and countertransference in the male/female therapy dyad, and common factors that should be addressed regardless of modality (e.g., gender-role strain; the necessity of self-reflection around gender stereotyping). The book does not directly address substance addiction and issues relevant to particular subgroups of men (e.g., gay, transsexual, disabled, low socioeconomic status). It does however address, in the context of race and gender privilege and roles, issues relevant to minority men, batterers, and men with post-combat posttraumatic stress disorder. Most chapters contain illustrative clinical case studies of clinical impasses, countertransferences, and lessons learned.</p>
<p>A central theme throughout the book is a new “fourth-wave feminism” that is inclusive of men and compassionate towards both sexes. Authors refer to the societal pressure for men to be invulnerable and therefore guarded in therapy. Therapy can feel unfamiliar and threatening. The clinician is advised for example to assess the male client’s expectations for counseling because it may stray from the therapist’s usual approach; be patient with the “normative male alexithymia” (p. 228) as he begins to access his emotions; and recognize common manifestations of depression (e.g., workaholism and anger). Because many men are socialized to avoid expression of emotion and vulnerability, the therapist may need to use a more didactic than psychodynamic approach.</p>
<p>Most clinical programs do not provide direct clinical training in the psychology of men. This book is an introduction to the topic, particularly for female clinicians. The self-reflection and examination of issues that arise around countertransference and being a female in a position of authority is of interest to the scientist-practitioner. The reader is inspired to pursue further reading on this topic for more instruction and case studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684313480047">Rabinowitz &amp; Cochran, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Some detail could have been edited out of the personal and professional journeys. At times, they became tangential to the focus on clinical work with men, as did chapters heavier in bulleted lists of introductory technique than in illustrative case studies. Inclusion of the personal narratives, however, is an innovative and feminist approach. This approach is valuable to the female clinician seeking validation of her own journey or inspiration and advice on how, whether, and where to proceed in her clinical career with male clients. Terri Morse and others describe, for example, their move from the earliest stages of feminist identity development to understanding how “sexism might harm men as well.” Morse writes, “When I downplay my femininity, this allows men to more comfortably open themselves up … If I present myself in a sexual manner, in <italic>any</italic> way, my work as a gender-aware therapist is compromised … I am embarrassed now by the sexually exploitative behavior I used in the past to distract men in personal and professional settings” (p. 114). Personal experiences like this are informative and less likely to appear in an academic text or casebook.</p>
