<abstract>
<p>This article addresses two questions: First, what explains the very low level of ratifications of the international legal instruments for the protection of the rights of migrant workers? Second, what are the implications for research and policy debates on the rights of migrant workers in practice? The author argues that the key reason for the underratification and limited effectiveness of international migrant rights conventions relates to the perceived and/or real consequences (different types of costs and benefits) of extending rights to migrants for the national interests (however defined) of nation-states. In addition to their intrinsic value, the rights of migrant workers play an important instrumental role in shaping the outcomes of international labor migration for receiving countries, migrants, and their countries of origin. Migrant rights are in practice a core component of nation-states’ labor immigration policies, which involve decisions on the number and type of migrants to be admitted as well as their rights after admission. Consequently, migrant rights cannot be studied in isolation of admission policy, in terms of both positive and normative analysis. To understand why, when, and how countries restrict migrant workers’ rights, and to discuss what rights migrant workers should have, one needs to consider the potential interrelationships between migrant rights, on one hand, and national policies for admitting migrant workers, on the other hand. This opens up a new and important research agenda that has thus far remained largely unexplored.</p>

<p>“Migrant rights are human rights” is a common argument made by migrant rights advocates around the world. In 1990, the United Nations (UN) adopted a new human rights treaty that specifically deals with the rights of migrant workers and their families. After 20 years, fewer than 50 countries, none of them major immigration countries, have ratified this treaty. Even ardent supporters of the human rights approach to migration acknowledge that nation-states’ response to the 1990 convention has been extremely disappointing. The great majority of countries clearly do not consider migrant rights as human rights that should be codified and ratified in domestic law.</p>
<p>This article discusses why so few countries have ratified international legal instruments for the protection of the rights of migrant workers. On the basis of a critical review of the existing literature, I argue that the primary explanation lies with the effects of granting or restricting migrant rights on the national interests (however defined) of migrant-receiving countries. This may sound like an obvious point, but the dearth of discussion about the multifaceted costs and benefits of specific migrant rights for receiving countries—and for migrants and their countries of origin—suggests that this is an important gap in analysis and debate that needs to be urgently addressed.</p>
<p>To more explicitly link the discussion of migrant rights to the role and interests of nation-states, the article makes the case for studying migrant rights as a core component of countries’ labor immigration policies. The design of any labor immigration policy involves simultaneous policy decisions on how to regulate the <italic>number</italic> and <italic>skills</italic> of migrant workers to be admitted and on the <italic>rights</italic> to be granted to migrants after admission. Consequently, migrant rights cannot be studied in isolation of admission policy, in terms of both positive and normative analysis.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002764212443815">
<title>Principles and Content of International Migrant Rights Conventions</title>
<p>The key features and principles of human rights include <italic>universality</italic>, that is, human rights apply everywhere and to everyone (including migrants); <italic>indivisibility</italic>, that is, there is no hierarchy of rights and certain types of rights cannot be separated from others; <italic>inalienability</italic>, that is, human rights cannot be denied to any human being, nor can they be given up voluntarily; and <italic>equality and nondiscrimination</italic>, that is, all individuals are equal as human beings. Human rights derive from a “common humanity” and the “inherent dignity of each human person” rather than from citizenship of a particular country.</p>
<p>The legal and normative basis of the human rights approach to international migration comprises various international human rights treaties and separate legal instruments that specifically relate to migrants (for an overview of the international human rights framework for migrants, see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764212443815">Weissbrodt, 2008</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212443815">Cholewinski, 1997</xref>). The three most significant international legal instruments that address the rights of migrant workers are the UN’s (1990) International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (henceforth “CMW”) and the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Migration of Employment Convention (ILO) and the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (ILO). Together with the more general human rights treaties, these instruments set out a very comprehensive set of civil, political, economic, social, and other rights for migrants, including the right to equal protections under labor laws, antidiscrimination laws, and family laws. The CMW in particular has become a cornerstone of the rights-based approach to migration advocated by many international organizations and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) concerned with the protection of migrant workers.</p>
<p>Briefly, ILO Convention 97 (adopted in 1949) was motivated by a concern to facilitate the movement of surplus labor from Europe to other parts of the world. It encourages countries to sign bilateral recruitment agreements (a model agreement is included in the associated ILO Recommendation 86) and includes measures to regulate the conditions in which migration occurs, general protection provisions, and, for the first time, measures to ensure equal treatment for migrant workers in various aspects of recruitment and employment. Specifically, Article 6 requires each member state for which this convention is in force to grant migrant workers equal treatment with regard to remuneration, membership in trade unions, and enjoyment of the benefits of collective bargaining, accommodation, and social security (subject to certain limitations, most notably, that “there may be appropriate arrangements for the maintenance of acquired rights and rights in course of acquisition”). Article 7 stipulates that any public employment services provided to migrants must be free of charge. Importantly, the protections of ILO Convention 97 apply only to migrant workers who are legally residing and working in the host country.</p>
<p>In light of the radical economic and social changes during the 1960s and early 1970s (including the termination of various guest worker programs throughout Europe), ILO Convention 143 (adopted in 1975) aimed at bringing migration flows under control, focusing on the elimination of irregular migration and suppressing activities of organizers of illegal movements of migrants. The preamble to this convention speaks of the need to “avoid excessive and uncontrolled or unassisted increase of migratory movements,” which clearly reflects the concerns about immigration pressures at the time. Article 10 widens the scope of equality between migrants and nationals of the host state by requiring not only equal treatment but also equality of opportunity in respect of “employment and occupation, of social security, of trade union and cultural rights and of individual and collective freedoms for persons who as migrant workers or as members of their families are lawfully within its territory.” Article 8 stipulates that host countries must not restrict a migrant’s rights to free choice of employment for more than 2 years; that loss of employment shall not, in its own, imply a loss of residence permit; and that all migrants who have legally resided in the host country “shall enjoy equality of treatment with nationals in respect in particular of guarantees of security of employment, the provision of alternative employment, relief work and retraining.” For the first time in international law, ILO Convention 143 also includes some rights for migrants in irregular status, who, according to Article 9, should enjoy equality “in respect of rights arising out of past employment as regards remuneration, social security and other benefits.”</p>
<p>Based on more than a decade of negotiations, the CMW (adopted in 1990) incorporates and builds on ILO Conventions 97 and 143. It sets out a very broad set of rights for migrants, including those living and/or working abroad illegally. The CMW includes 93 articles (compared to 23 articles of ILO Convention 97 and 24 articles of ILO Convention 143) and extends fundamental human rights to all migrant workers, both regular and irregular, with additional rights being recognized for regular migrant workers and members of their families. Importantly, the CMW is based on the principle of equal treatment of migrant and nationals rather than on “minimum standards” characterizing many other international legal instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212443815">Lonnroth, 1991</xref>). Examples of rights stipulated by the CMW for both regular and irregular migrants include</p>
<list id="list1-0002764212443815" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the right to life (Article 9);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the right to be free from forced labor (Article 11);</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>the right not to have identity documents confiscated (Article 21);</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>the right to join and take part in meetings and activities of trades unions (Article 26).</p></list-item></list>
<p>Additional rights of regular migrants include</p>
<list id="list2-0002764212443815" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the right to form associations and trade unions (Article 40);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the right to equal treatment with nationals in relation to access to education institutions, vocational training, housing (including social housing), and social and health services (Article 43);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the right to seek alternative employment in case of termination of work contract prior to expiration of the work permit (Article 51);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the right to freely choose their remunerated activity after 5 years of residence in the host country (Article 52);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the right to equality of treatment with citizens in respect of protection against dismissal, employment benefits, and access to public work schemes intended to combat unemployment (Article 54); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the right to redress in case of violation of the terms of the employment contract (Article 54).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The CMW also deals with the right to family reunification but in a limited and carefully worded way. Article 44 suggests that
<disp-quote>
<p>states parties shall take measures that they deem appropriate and that fall within their competence to facilitate the reunification of migrant workers with their spouses of persons who have with the migrant worker a relationship that, according to applicable law, produces effects equivalent to marriage, as well as with their minor dependent unmarried children.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Importantly, only some of the rights stipulated in the CMW are new rights. Most are included in and derived from the earlier general human rights treaties, including especially the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (both adopted in 1966). Although the rights stipulated in all six core human rights adopted before the CMW (see the list below <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764212443815">Figure 1</xref>) are meant to apply to all people regardless of nationality or citizenship status, their application to non-nationals had generally not been made explicit. The CMW may thus be regarded as a “more precise interpretation of human rights in the case of migrant workers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212443815">de Guchteneire &amp; Pécoud, 2009</xref>, p. 8).</p>

<title>Ratification: Record and Obstacles</title>
<p>In practice, the ratifications of the CMW and ILO conventions on migrant workers by state parties have been very disappointing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764212443815">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0002764212443815">2</xref>), in both absolute terms (i.e., considering the total number of UN and ILO member states) and in relative terms (i.e., compared to the ratifications of other human rights treaties and ILO conventions). With fewer than 50 ratifications by the end of 2010, the CMW is the least-ratified treaty among all major human rights treaties. It has a quarter of the ratifications of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (passed a year before the CMW) and also fewer ratifications than the Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (passed 16 years <italic>after</italic> the CMW). The few countries that have ratified the CMW are predominantly countries of net emigration rather than net immigration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764212443815">1</xref></sup> The average share of migrants in their population is 3%, compared to more than 10% in developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764212443815">UN Population Division [UNPD], 2009</xref>). They are all “low-income” or “middle-income” countries (according to World Bank classifications), with three quarters having a “low” or “medium” human development index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764212443815">UNDP, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>A third of the counties that have ratified the CMW have added reservations. The most common article affected by the reservation is Article 92, Paragraph 1, which provides that any unresolved dispute may be submitted to arbitration or the international court of justice at the request of one of the parties involved.</p>
<p>These figures suggest that although accepting the idea of human rights, the world’s high-income countries—where migrants are most heavily concentrated—clearly do not accept that these rights should also apply to migrants living on their territories. It is also noteworthy, however, that some major sending countries, such as Indonesia, have also not ratified the convention.</p>
<p>Academic and policy analyses of the reasons for nation-states’ reluctance to sign up to international migrant worker conventions, especially to the CMW, have suggested a wide range of obstacles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002764212443815">2</xref></sup> A commonly mentioned factor is a lack of promotion, awareness, and understanding of the CMW in many countries. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764212443815">Taran (2000)</xref> points out that “until 2001, there was not one person anywhere in the world, in any international organization, in any government, or any civil society group engaged with full-time responsibilities related to promoting this Convention” (p. 18). More recent analyses have confirmed that although in some countries, civil society organizations have succeeded in raising the profile of the CMW in the past decade, awareness of its existence and content remains relatively low in most countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212443815">de Guchteneire &amp; Pécoud, 2009</xref>). In her analysis of attitudes toward the CMW in Asia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212443815">Piper (2009)</xref> finds that some countries do not understand all the technical details of the CMW, with many mistakenly assuming, Piper argues, that the convention is an instrument of a liberal immigration policy that significantly limits states’ ability to regulate the admission of migrants.</p>
<p>A second set of obstacles frequently discussed in the existing literature relates to legal issues. One argument is that because of its length and complexity, ratification would in many countries be slow and would often necessitate significant changes in national laws and legislation. For example, only a year after the CMW was adopted, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764212443815">Helton (1991)</xref> discussed the very significant changes in U.S. labor, immigration, and civil rights laws that would be required, thus raising serious doubts about the likelihood of ratification in the United States in the near future. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212443815">Cholewinski (1997)</xref> argues that “technical questions, alone, therefore, may prevent many states from speedily accepting these provisions” (p. 202). Another argument relating to legal issues concerns the overlap of the CMW with both national and international laws, including other migrant workers conventions. Some countries argue that many of the rights stipulated in the CMW are already covered by their national laws. They also point to the significant overlap—and some tensions—between the rights stipulated in the CMW the ILO’s migrant worker conventions and the existing core human rights treaties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212443815">Bohning, 1991</xref>). For example, a 2005 report by Germany’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs suggests that “Germany will continue to work in the United Nations for the strengthening of the protection of human rights for migrants. It is convinced that this protection is thoroughly guaranteed by the implementation of the basic human rights agreements” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764212443815">Hillman &amp; Koppenfels, 2009</xref>, p. 336).</p>
<p>Third, the low level of ratification of the CMW has been partly attributed to various contextual factors, including, for example, an adverse economic and social climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764212443815">Hune &amp; Niessen, 1994</xref>). This argument essentially suggests that economic downturns create various economic and social pressures, such as high unemployment and welfare dependency, that make it difficult for governments in high-income countries to promote the rights of migrant workers. Another contextual factor is a reluctance of “being first” to ratify the convention. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212443815">Piper (2009)</xref> suggests that Japan and Korea are generally reluctant to take leadership in ratifying international conventions, preferring to wait for Europe to take the lead. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212443815">Pécoud and de Guchteneire (2006)</xref> argue that European countries’ unwillingness to ratify the convention also discouraged countries in north Africa and eastern Europe from ratifying. France has claimed that it cannot ratify the convention independently of other EU member states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764212443815">Oger, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Some of these factors have undoubtedly played a role in discouraging high-income countries from ratifying the CMW in the past 20 years. Rather than being fundamental root causes, however, most of these factors are auxiliary issues that reflect and stem from a much more fundamental—and in many ways, obvious—explanation of nation-states’ reluctance to sign up to international migrant worker conventions.</p>
<p>The key underlying factor, now widely accepted among analysts of the CMW, relates to the national interests, however perceived, and politics of nation-states. Rights do not have only intrinsic value, as emphasized by the human rights approach to migration, but they also play an important instrumental role in shaping the effects of migration. Consequently, the rights that major immigration countries are willing to grant to migrant workers critically depend on their impacts on the existing population in the host country. These impacts can involve perceived and/or real benefits and costs that could be economic, social, political, and/or cultural. A number of empirical studies of the CMW have confirmed that a major obstacle to ratification is the perceived cost of granting specific rights to migrant workers. In particular, many immigration countries consider the comprehensive set of rights stipulated in the CMW as being in conflict with their policies of regulating immigration, especially of low- and medium-skilled migrants, through temporary migration programs that restrict some of the rights of migrants, such as the right to free choice of employment, the right to equal access to social welfare benefits, and the right to family reunification.</p>
<p>In Canada, for example, a key obstacle to ratification of the CMW is the government’s view that signing the convention would create serious problems, and may well be incompatible with, Canada’s temporary migration programs for low-skilled migrant workers, especially its ability to the restrict the employment of migrants to specific sectors and occupations that are suffering from labor shortages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764212443815">Piche, Depatie-Pelletier, &amp; Epale, 2009</xref>). Similarly, the U.K. government has made it very explicit that the key reasons for not ratifying the CMW are the associated costs for Britain and the impacts on the government’s ability to manage immigration in the best interest of Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212443815">Ryan, 2009</xref>). The following excerpt from a government statement to the House of Commons Select Committee in International Development illustrates this point:
<disp-quote>
<p>If the UK were to ratify the Convention, we would not be able to restrict the employment that work permit holders can do to that specified on their permit and they would have access to public funds from the date they entered the UK. . . . Giving all migrant workers access to public funds from the date of entry would therefore not only be costly, but also create an unnecessary “pull factor.” (pp. 11-12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Concerns about costs are also at the heart of many countries’ reluctance to grant rights to irregular migrant workers, another major obstacle to ratification of the CMW, which includes rights for both regular and irregular migrants. Although in some countries, the argument against rights for irregular migrants is framed in terms of the importance of maintaining the “rule of law,” it is clear that the perceived costs of granting rights to migrants without legal residence status are an equally important, if not the decisive, obstacle (see, for example, the analysis of Germany’s unwillingness to ratify the CMW by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764212443815">Hillman and Koppenfels, 2009</xref>). The same applies to concerns about potential costs of family reunification, which many countries, rightly or wrongly, believe to be encouraged by the CMW (see the discussion of Japan’s and Korea’s attitudes toward the CMW in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212443815">Piper, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>If so many countries do not ratify the CMW because of the perceived costs of doing so, what explains, one may ask, the complexity, comprehensiveness, and eventual adoption of the CMW by the UN in the first place? The answer lies in the drafting process of the CMW, which lasted for more than a decade. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212443815">Vucetic (2007)</xref>, the CMW was “largely made by developing states for developing states” (p. 418). The drafting process formally began with the establishment of an open-ended working group in 1979, chaired by Mexico and Morocco. Key developing countries had been successful in their attempts to entrust the drafting process to the UN in New York rather than to the ILO in Geneva, partly because of the ILO’s tripartite structure, which means that unlike the UN, there was no automatic majority of developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212443815">Bohning, 1991</xref>). The first complete draft text of a convention was submitted by seven Asian, African, and Latin American countries from the Group of 77 (G77), a coalition of developing nations founded in 1964. Although its first draft was rejected, the G77 remained a powerful group during the negotiations in the 1980s. The other major groups in the negotiations included a small group of major receiving states (including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States), which were concerned about the costs of the CMW and keen on ensuring that the CMW does not interfere with their ability to regulate admission and regularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212443815">Lonroth, 1991</xref>), and the so-called MESCA countries, which originally included Finland, Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and later, Norway. The governments of all of the MESCA countries had, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212443815">Bohning (1991)</xref>, a decidedly “socialist flavoring” in the early 1980s and, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212443815">Vucetic (2007)</xref>, were all sympathetic to the extensive promotion of human rights of migrants. Proposals by the MESCA countries eventually became the basis for the final text of the convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212443815">Lonnroth, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of major high-income countries, including Australia, Germany, Japan, and the United States, indicated during the drafting process that they were unlikely to ratify the convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212443815">Cholewinski, 1997</xref>, p. 203). They used various strategies that enabled them to nevertheless support the eventual adoption of the CMW by consensus. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764212443815">Hillman and Koopenfels (2009)</xref> describe how Germany followed what became known as the “German formula” during the negotiations. This involved proposing alternative workings to points that Germany objected to. After these were rejected, Germany asked for them to be noted in protocol. This strategy enabled Germany to formally support the convention while still being able to refer back to its criticism and concerns throughout the drafting process, thus maintaining its ambiguous position toward the CMW. Japan followed a similar strategy by submitting alternative formulations even after some of the provisions had already been agreed on by consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212443815">Lonroth, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, national interests and impacts—and not concerns about the protection of the human rights of migrants—were at the forefront of the politics of the drafting process of the CMW. In his discussion of the drafting process, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212443815">Bohning (1991)</xref> noted that “it is sadly true that it is not so much the concern of the proponents of international humanitarian law as the constellation of political power relationships which is at the origin of the drafting process of international instruments” (p. 698). It is difficult to disagree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212443815">Vucetic’s (2007)</xref> assessment that “more sensitivity to the potentially disproportional costs of the CMW in the drafting phase would have increased its chances of success” (p. 419).</p>

<title>Effectiveness of the CMW</title>
<p>The gap between the comprehensive set of rights stipulated by the international human rights framework, on one hand, and the rights that most migrant workers enjoy in practice, on the other, should not be taken as a reason for rejecting the human rights approach as ineffective. Even if they are not ratified, international migrant rights treaties can play an important political and strategic role. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764212443815">Wexler (2007)</xref> argues that they can serve nonlegal functions by influencing nonbinding regional processes, contributing to the development and dissemination of best practices, and helping produce and codify a human rights discourse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764212443815">Diaz and Kuhner (2009)</xref> suggest that Mexico’s ratification of the CMW helps its efforts to advocate and promote the rights of Mexican migrants in the United States even though the United States has not ratified the convention. In the United Kingdom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212443815">Ryan (2009)</xref> argues the convention is a useful “authoritative statement of the minimum international standards with respect to migrant workers” (p. 293) that is increasingly used by NGOs and migrant rights advocates and that has become relevant to political debates on migration, even if there is a very low chance that the United Kingdom will ratify the CMW in the short or medium term. It has also been suggested that the CMW can enable civil society organizations to raise awareness and speak more forcefully about the rights of migrant workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212443815">Piper, 2009</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212443815">International Steering Committee for the Campaign for Ratification of the Migrant Rights Convention (2009)</xref> argues that the convention has become “an instrument of reference for States parties and non-ratifying countries, including those that have stated explicitly that they do not wish to ratify it” (p. 7). At a more general level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212443815">Sen (2004)</xref> argues that human rights serve the important function of indicating important ethical demands (rather than direct legal claims and commands) that highlight the significance of considering the freedoms of human beings.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite these potential benefits of the CMW even when not ratified, it is clear that the low levels of ratification and the nonratification by all major immigration countries severely limit the CMW’s applicability and effectiveness in protecting the great majority of migrant workers. The 20th anniversary of the CMW on December 18, 2010, was not a day for celebrating the CMW’s effectiveness in protecting the rights of migrant workers. Given the low levels of ratification in its first 20 years, it is hard to deny that the CMW has been largely unsuccessful in achieving its main stated aim of providing an effective framework for protecting the rights of migrant workers in the global economy. Moreover, there is also a big question mark concerning the implementation of the CMW’s rights among countries that have ratified the treaty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764212443815">Hathaway (2002)</xref> provides evidence suggesting that the ratification of human rights treaties may sometimes lead to a worsening rather than an improvement of human rights practices, especially in countries that are not fully democratic. This is because of the expressive role of human rights treaties. As Hathaway argues,
<disp-quote>
<p>ratifying a human rights treaty can relieve pressure for change imposed by international actors, who may rely more heavily on positions than effects in evaluating countries’ records. This reduction in pressure may in turn lead a country that ratified to improve practices less than it otherwise might. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764212443815">Hathaway, 2002</xref>, p. 202)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although there is no evidence to suggest that this effect generally applies to the CMW, some of the low-income sending countries that have ratified the convention have very poor human rights records. Freedom House carries out annual assessments of the political rights and civil liberties (of all people, not just migrants) in a large number of countries. According to the latest assessment, 10 of the countries that ratified the CMW are “not free,” 21 are “partly free,” and only 12 are classified as “free” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764212443815">Freedom House, 2010</xref>). It is not unreasonable to speculate that some of the low-income sending countries that have ratified the convention primarily use it for campaigning for better rights of their nationals abroad rather than to help improve the situation of migrants in their own countries.</p>

<title>Migrant Rights, Citizenship Rights, and Immigration Policy</title>
<p>The key implication of the foregoing analysis is that the main reason for the failure of existing international conventions to achieve more ratifications and more effectively protect the rights of migrant workers stems from the instrumental role of rights in shaping the impacts of migration for the receiving country. The legal rights that migrant workers enjoy are significantly influenced by their impacts on the national interest (however defined) of the host country. Migrant rights cannot, therefore, be comprehensively analyzed and debated without a discussion of the role and interests of the state in granting and restricting migrant rights.</p>
<p>To link the role and interests of nation-states to the rights of migrant workers, it is useful to conceptualize migrant rights as a subset of citizenship rights. Citizenship can be viewed as a legal status that links individuals to states and that is associated with certain citizenship rights and duties. Like human rights, citizenship rights can be classified in various ways. Citizenship rights may be broadly divided, for example, into civic, political, and social rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764212443815">Marshall, 1965</xref>) and/or classified into more detailed categories, such as economic rights, cultural rights, and gender rights (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764212443815">Castles &amp; Davidson, 2000</xref>). A key characteristic of citizenship rights is that unlike human rights, they derive from a relationship with a particular state rather than from universal notions of “personhood” or “human dignity.”</p>
<p>Many migrants do not have citizenship status in the host country and, consequently, no automatic access to the full set of rights of citizens of their country of employment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764212443815">Hammar’s [1990]</xref> discussion of “denizens”). In practice, nation-states have used their immigration, integration, and naturalization policies to limit and tightly regulate migrants’ access to citizenship status and to specific citizenship rights. The legal rights that migrants enjoy are typically dependent on their immigration and residence status in the host country. The immigration policies of most high-income countries create a number of different types of residence status for different types of migrants, each of which is associated with different rights and restrictions. Most countries make significant distinctions, for example, between the rights of migrants with permanent residence status (who usually enjoy most of the rights of citizens except for the right to vote), temporary migrants (whose economic and social rights are often restricted), and illegally resident migrants (who typically enjoy few rights in most countries). Further distinctions and restrictions of rights based on the migrant’s nationality (e.g., member states of the European Union grant more rights to other EU nationals than to non-EU nationals) and purpose of residence (e.g., work, study, join family, asylum) are common and often contribute to highly complex sets of residence statuses and associated rights and restrictions.</p>
<p>States regulate not only migrants’ access to specific residence statuses and associated rights but also the possibilities for switching between different statuses in the host country. The state may change the legal status and associated access to rights of an individual or group over time. This could be done, for example, by creating new immigration statuses or by moving people within existing statuses, as was the case when the EU enlarged in May 2004, or, more generally, under any regularization of illegally resident migrants or through naturalization policies that grant migrants full citizenship status.</p>
<p>Migrants’ restricted and differentiated access to citizenship rights in practice makes clear that nation-states have and do exercise significant (although not complete) control over the rights of migrant workers on their territories. Policy decisions about the regulation of the rights of different types of migrant workers are, in practice, an integral part of nation-states’ overall labor immigration policies. More specifically, the rights of migrant workers constitute, and can be analyzed as, one of the three core components of labor immigration policy.</p>
<p>The design of labor immigration policy requires nation-states to make three fundamental decisions: (a) how to regulate the <italic>number</italic> of migrants to be admitted (e.g., through quotas or points-based systems), (b) how to <italic>select</italic> migrants (e.g., by skill and/or nationality), and (c) what <italic>rights</italic> to grant migrants after admission (e.g., free choice of employment, access to welfare benefits, temporary of permanent residence, access to citizenship, etc.). The question about rights involves questions about the rights migrants should receive after admission and whether and how these rights should change over time.</p>
<p>A key point of this approach is that migrant rights cannot be studied in isolation from admission policy, in terms of both positive and normative analysis. Immigration challenges nation-states by raising questions about both admission and access to citizenship rights. They are interrelated policy challenges that nation-states address simultaneously. Consequently, to understand why, when, and how countries restrict migrant workers’ rights, and to discuss what rights migrant workers <italic>should</italic> have, one needs to consider the potential interrelationships between migrant rights, on one hand, and national policies for admitting migrant workers, on the other hand.</p>
<p>I suggest the following three hypotheses about the relationships between openness, skills, and migrant rights as useful starting points for research and debate. They draw from the discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764212443815">Ruhs and Martin (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764212443815">Ruhs (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764212443815">2010)</xref> and are more fully developed, and empirically tested, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764212443815">Ruhs (2013)</xref>.</p>
<list id="list3-0002764212443815" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Labor immigration programs in high-income countries are characterized by a positive relationship between openness to admitting migrants and the targeted skill level of the migrant workers; that is, programs that target higher-skilled migrants are more open to labor immigration than those targeting lower-skilled migrants.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>There are at least three reasons for expecting this relationship in high-income countries. First, skilled migrants can be expected to generate greater complementarities with the skills and capital of the existing population (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764212443815">Borjas, 1995</xref>). Second, endogenous growth models emphasize the importance of human capital and knowledge for long-term economic growth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212443815">Lucas, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764212443815">Romer, 1986</xref>). Third, the net fiscal impact of immigration, that is, the difference between the taxes that migrants pay and the costs of public services and benefits that migrants consume, critically depends on migrants’ earnings and thus skills. Everything else being equal, skilled migrants employed in high-skilled jobs will pay more taxes and be eligible for fewer welfare benefits than low-skilled migrants in low-skilled jobs.</p>
<list id="list4-0002764212443815" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Some of the rights of migrant workers are positively related to the skill level targeted by the labor immigration program under which migrants are admitted; that is, higher skilled migrants are given more rights than lower skilled migrants.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764212443815">Holmes and Sunstein (1999)</xref> persuasively argue, rights cannot be protected or enforced without public funding. The costs of rights vary across different types of rights and are likely to be context specific. For example, in most liberal democracies, the cost of protecting one (more) person’s right to free speech can be expected to be lower than the cost of providing one (more) person with free health care. It is also important to add that rights can create costs as well as benefits (economic, social, cultural, and other) in the short, medium, and long run.</p>
<p>If, as argued in this article, migrant rights are instruments and the result of a policy choice (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764212443815">Cox &amp; Posner, 2009</xref>), it is plausible to expect high-income countries with limited budgets to selectively and strategically restrict some of the rights of migrants in a way that maximizes the net benefits for the receiving country. The cost of some rights (e.g., some social rights) is inversely related to the skill level (and, thus, earnings) of the migrant. For example, as described above, low-skilled workers in low-skilled jobs can be expected to make smaller tax contributions and greater demands on the welfare state than higher-skilled workers in higher-paying jobs. This is why some, but not all, of the rights granted to migrants under labor immigration programs can be expected to critically depend on their skills.</p>
<p>It is important to be clear that for many migrant rights, it will be in the interest of the receiving country to grant rather than deny rights. For example, protecting the rights of migrant workers in the labor market can be an important tool for protecting domestic workers by helping ensure that employers do not prefer migrant workers because they can be employed under restricted rights. There are many other examples where the protection rather than restriction of rights for migrants will create net benefits rather than net costs for the residents of the receiving country.</p>
<list id="list5-0002764212443815" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: There can be a trade-off (a negative relationship) between openness and some of the rights of some migrant workers admitted to high-income countries; that is, greater openness to admitting migrant workers will be associated with relatively fewer rights for migrants and vice versa.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The basis for this hypothesis is closely related to the first two: If certain rights for some migrants, for example, those with low or medium skills, create—or are perceived to create—net costs for the receiving country, policy openness to admitting such migrants can be expected to critically depend on the extent to which some of their rights can be restricted. For example, to minimize the fiscal costs of low-skilled migrants for existing residents, high-income countries can be expected to admit either relatively low numbers of low-skilled migrants with full or close-to-full social rights or larger numbers with more restricted rights. Restricting low-skilled migrants’ rights to welfare benefits and public services removes some (but not all) of the arguments for selecting skilled rather than low-skilled migrants in high-income countries.</p>
<p>If these relationships can be observed and can be applied in practice—an important and open question for empirical analysis—they raise important and difficult questions for debates about how to better promote and protect the interests of migrant workers in the global labor market.</p>

<sec id="section5-0002764212443815">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The approach to the analysis of migrant rights suggested in this article is, in my view, critical to fostering a more realistic debate about the protection of migrant workers in the global labor market. It does, however, raise challenging and highly sensitive issues that can easily be misunderstood or misrepresented. It can be argued, for example, that any discussion of the “impacts of rights,” and especially the use of the term <italic>costs of rights</italic>, carries the danger of being misused or misinterpreted to justify or argue for more restrictions of the rights of migrant workers. It is important to emphasize that just because some rights generate net costs for the receiving state does not mean that there is a moral justifications for condoning or even advocating restrictions of these rights. There is also no suggestion in this article that all discussion of migrant rights should be reduced to debates about costs and benefits.</p>
<p>The article engages in a discussion of the instrumental role and consequences of rights because one cannot, in my view, hope to close the gap between human rights and migrant rights in practice unless one understands and takes into account the reasons nation-states grant and restrict certain rights in practice. In other words, the current analysis and debate of what <italic>should b</italic>e needs to be complemented (but not replaced!) by a thorough discussion of what <italic>is</italic>.</p>
