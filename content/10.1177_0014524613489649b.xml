<p>The text known as 2 Maccabees has not received huge attention previously in the form of commentaries. This makes this fresh Hermeneia commentary a welcome addition to scholarship on this fascinating writing. Doran commences his treatment by noting that the title ‘2 Maccabees’ is misleading since it ‘is not a continuation of 1 Maccabees …[and it] is not a history of the Maccabees revolt against their Seleucid overlords’ (p. 1). Rather he sees it as a rhetorical and ideological text that encourages continuance in Jewish ancestral traditions. Problems of dating the text are explored. The account narrates events in Judea between 175 – 164 B.C.E. In part the issue of the dating the two prefixed letters gives a date of the final form of the text. However Doran states that if ‘the narrative is uncoupled from the prefixed letters, it can be dated … almost anywhere is the last 150 years B.C.’ (p. 14). Two major goals of the text are identified. First, ‘the choice of the subgenre of a deity defending his/her temple from attackers.’ (p. 13). This is seen as impressing on readers the high honour of the God of the Jews. Secondly, the narrative serves to emphasize ‘the theme of the Jews as good citizens’ (p. 13).</p>
<p>The commentary treatment is helpful throughout. Readers are given a balanced assessment of the text. There is a detailed treatment of the two prefixed letters (pp. 23-39, 39-64 respectively) before launching into the narrative section. The comments draw upon insights of grammatical, historical and rhetorical criticism, which makes for a rich and nuanced treatment. The textual analysis also includes a brief section on the letters contained in 2 Macc. 11:16-38 (pp. 227-230). This is a major and significant treatment of this often-overlooked text, and it is certain to become a standard reference resource for years to come.</p>
