<p>What counts as global ‘harm’? This article explores this question through critical engagement with Thomas Pogge’s conception of negative duties not to harm. My purpose here is to show that while Pogge is right to orient global moral claims around negative duties not to harm, he is mistaken in departing from the standard understanding of these duties. Pogge ties negative duties to global institutions, but I argue that truly negative duties cannot apply to such institutions. In order to retain the global force of negative duties, we need to <italic>dissociate</italic> these duties from global institutions: each society’s negative duty to stop harming specific other societies ought to be seen as <italic>independent</italic> of global institutional change. In order to establish this thesis, I criticize both the features and the derivation of Pogge’s variant of negative duties. I conclude that one must see global negative duties as applying to the relations between specific sovereign societies as unitary agents rather than to global institutions. I then show how this view of negative duties can yield significant global reform, based on Pogge’s own accusations concerning democracies’ conferral of trading privileges upon dictators who embezzle state resources. After presenting the normative, empirical, and strategic advantages of such reform, I anticipate Poggean objections.</p>

<body>
<p>What does it mean to ‘harm’? This question is particularly important in a global context. Proof that a society is harming non-compatriots is a much stronger trigger for action than the accusation that it is merely failing to help. In the latter case, the excuses are well known: our citizens ought to come first; foreigners’ plight is the result of and should be attended to by their own governments; our ability to help is limited anyway, and the list goes on.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470594X12447784">1</xref>
</sup> Whether or not such excuses withstand close scrutiny, they indicate the added global value of negative duties not to harm, as distinct from positive duties to help. Duties not to harm others do not leave any room for ‘near and dear’ objections, nor do they allow the offender to pass the buck to someone else. If <italic>you</italic> are harming others, it is <italic>you</italic> who ought to stop, and this kind of duty is just as strong abroad as it is at home. An argument from negative duties thus has a strategic advantage at the global level.</p>
<p>Taking this advantage as its point of departure, this article critically engages Thomas Pogge’s unique conception of negative duties, the most important attempt to bring such duties to the heart of the global justice debate. Pogge has been insisting that we, citizens of affluent democracies through our elected governments, impose manifestly unjust global institutions on the world’s poor, and that in doing so we violate our duty of forbearance towards them. Since the 1970s scholars have conceived democracies’ global duties as primarily positive duties to help. We ought to help the global poor, Peter Singer for example famously argued, just as a by-passer ought to help a child drowning in a shallow pond. Pogge, however, has been claiming that we are <italic>not</italic> innocent by-passers: <italic>we</italic> (along with others) threw the child <italic>into</italic> the water. Much before helping, we are morally responsible for extreme poverty because we are <italic>harming</italic> the world’s deprived.</p>
<p>My purpose here is to show that while Pogge is right to orient global moral claims around negative duties not to harm, he is mistaken in departing from the standard understanding of these duties. Pogge ties negative duties to global institutions, but I will argue that truly negative duties cannot apply to such institutions. In order to retain the global force of negative duties, we need to <italic>dissociate</italic> these duties from global institutions: each society’s negative duty to stop harming specific other societies ought to be seen as <italic>independent</italic> of global institutional change.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470594X12447784">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In terms of the (already extensive) ‘Pogge debate’, this claim is significant since while Pogge’s accusations have received much scrutiny, most of his critics have questioned the empirical part of these accusations (concerning the actual causes of global poverty), giving far less attention to the philosophical basis of his position.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470594X12447784">3</xref>
</sup> The few critics who have commented on Pogge’s philosophical underpinnings have tended to dismiss the negative duties strategy as fundamentally misguided, seeing the distinction between positive and negative duties as misleading, irrelevant, or both.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470594X12447784">4</xref>
</sup> Though I agree with the critics that an explicit reliance on positive duties is necessary in very specific cases, I believe they crucially miss the strategic advantages of negative duties.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470594X12447784">5</xref>
</sup> Accordingly, I will argue that the most fundamental problem with Pogge’s account is not that it focuses on negative duties, but rather that it cannot retain their unique force.</p>
<p>However, my critique goes beyond the dispute concerning Pogge’s thesis. If my argument is convincing, then global theory and practice as a whole needs to shift toward an ‘<italic>inward look</italic>’. Each democratic society ought to stop harming for the sake of <italic>its own</italic> moral integrity, <italic>independently</italic> of the victims’ prospects or the conduct of other democracies.</p>
<p>This appeal to self-reform will often take an explicitly Kantian form, specifically following what Pogge has called Kant’s ‘rigorism’. The term, as Pogge uses it and as I will employ it here, refers to a <italic>demand to act that is independent of others’ behavior</italic>. Rigorism is embodied in the categorical imperative’s call, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470594X12447784">Pogge (1981</xref>: 58) put it, to ‘act right here and now as if the world conformed to my ideal of the realm of ends’, even if others do not act in the same fashion. Pogge has claimed (as early as the 1980s) that Kantian rigorism gives excessive attention to our moral stature at the expense of real-world consequences, and that we must ‘attempt to be of practical worth to others, rather than be overly concerned with the moral worth of ourselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 1981</xref>: 64). In contrast, I seek to show that rigorism has profound normative and practical value, mainly since negative <italic>duties are rigorist duties</italic>: much of their strength derives precisely from the demand to avoid certain actions <italic>independently</italic> of how others act. This demand forms the basis of what I will call <italic>rigorist cosmopolitanism</italic>.</p>
<p>The presentation of this cosmopolitanism proceeds as follows. The first section surveys Pogge’s key ideas (subsection 1.1), and then presents two theoretical critiques against Poggean negative duties. One critique (subsection 1.2) concerns their features. Pogge, I will try to show, loses the appeal of negative duties by taking away their rigorist elements. Poggean negative duties are <italic>outcome-oriented</italic>, pointing to a specific state of affairs to be achieved, yet much of the distinct force of negative duties derives from them being <italic>agent-oriented</italic>, pointing to specific actions that each agent ought to avoid and is capable of avoiding independently of the overall state of affairs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470594X12447784">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The other theoretical criticism (subsection 1.3) concerns the logic through which Pogge arrives at his version of negative duties. Pogge claims that agents have a <italic>negative</italic> duty to enact and support just institutions since institutions are necessary to specify their key rights and correlative negative duties. I dispute the idea that global institutions perform such a specification task. The full range of individuals’ rights and duties is already specified by their respective polities, leaving no similar role for global institutions. At the same time, the core rights and correlative negative duties of the body politic itself, as a collective agent vis-a-vis similar agents, can be known independently of global institutions. Both the features and the derivation of Pogge’s negative duties are therefore deficient. This means that in order to preserve the strategic advantage of negative duties we must return to their rigorist original (subsection 1.4): we must see global negative duties as applying to the relations between specific sovereign societies as unitary agents rather than to global institutions.</p>
<p>The second section shows how rigorist duties can ground a call for extensive global reform, based on Pogge’s own accusations concerning democracies’ conferral of trading privileges upon dictators who embezzle state resources. Pogge situates these privileges within his conception of negative duties, yet I argue that democratic complicity in dictators’ theft is essentially a rigorist problem. <italic>Each</italic> democracy ought to boycott embezzling dictators, simply in order to cease its own complicity in such theft, <italic>independently</italic> of broader change in global institutions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470594X12447784">7</xref>
</sup> The third section presents the normative, empirical, and strategic advantages of this rigorist rationale. Here I highlight an ‘overlapping consensus’ between statists and cosmopolitans, and the avoidance of some of Pogge’s key difficulties, including collective action issues and uncertainty about the domestic impact of global rule changes. The fourth section anticipates Poggean objections to the rigorist view concerning indifference to poverty (subsection 4.1), feasibility (subsection 4.2), and (instead of a conclusion) lack of ‘true cosmopolitanism’.</p>
<p>Before moving to the discussion itself, a few prefatory remarks are in order, first regarding Kant. The differences between Pogge’s approach and the rigorist alternative reflect different sources of Kantian inspiration. While Pogge’s basic philosophical commitments have been and remain deeply Kantian, their focus has shifted over the years, emphasizing potential insights from Kant’s political writings and marginalizing the Kantian ethics that motivate the rigorist alternative.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470594X12447784">8</xref>
</sup> What I am challenging is this marginalization, not the accuracy of Pogge’s reading of Kant. The Kantian dispute here is about relevance for contemporary political philosophy, not about the history of ideas.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1470594X12447784">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A second point concerns terminology. Pogge contrasts his ‘institutional’ approach with an ‘interactional’ view that focuses on rules of conduct for specific agents. I largely avoid these terms mainly since my approach is not ‘anti-institutional’ in one important sense: I agree with Pogge that as a unitary <italic>agent</italic> (the institution that is) the democratic body politic can violate negative duties and ought to be held collectively responsible for such violations. But I wish to show that these violations occur <italic>only</italic> through interactions between specific individuals or states, <italic>not</italic> through global institutions. The body politic ‘harms’ only through its conduct toward specific political communities, just as individuals harm other specific individuals.</p>
<p>Finally, this dispute assumes as background two points of agreement with Pogge. One is the stipulation of democracy (free and fair elections with the rule of law) as a standard of legitimacy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1470594X12447784">10</xref>
</sup> The other is the conviction that global political philosophy must be centered on nonideal theory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1470594X12447784">11</xref>
</sup> The content and priorities of this theory, however, remain different, first and foremost because of a different understanding of the ways in which democracies are currently harming other societies.</p>
<sec id="section1-1470594X12447784">
<title>1. Pogge’s negative duties</title>
<sec id="section2-1470594X12447784">
<title>1.1. Pogge’s rationale</title>
<p>Given the pressing problem of extreme poverty, Pogge aims to establish socioeconomic rights as generating negative duties, that is, duties that do not go against ‘the grain of the Anglo-American moral and legal tradition, in which it is often denied that persons have duties to protect and aid other persons in distress’ (1989: 34). In particular, the socioeconomic rights stipulated in the Universal Deceleration of Human Rights (UDHR), including the rights to ‘social security, rest and leisure, adequate standard of living [and] education’, are often seen as triggering only positive duties. Pogge believes that is why these rights are often dismissed (especially by those of libertarian sensitivities) as a vague moral ambition rather than a binding requirement – mere ‘manifesto rights’ (2002c: 64) that cannot be legitimately enforced. Accordingly, a key component of Pogge’s philosophical project since the 1980s has been to show that socioeconomic rights rest on ‘persons’ <italic>negative</italic> claim not to be made victims of unjust institutions’ (1989: 34).</p>
<p>In order for this statement to hold and ground a call for global reform, Pogge must establish the following three claims: (1) that persons have negative rather than positive duties to enact and comply with just institutions; (2) that there is a morally significant analogy between domestic and global institutions; and (3) that there is a minimalist standard of fairness according to which current global institutions can be deemed unjust.</p>
<p>Pogge argues that persons have negative duties to enact and support just institutions since the full content of individual rights and duties cannot be known solely through rules of personal conduct, apart from institutions. If politics means asking ‘who gets what, when, how’,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1470594X12447784">12</xref>
</sup> rules of conduct alone cannot give the answer: individual ethics cannot solve the distribution and coordination problems of the public realm.</p>
<p>The categorical imperative (CI) demonstrates the difficulty: it might be a valuable guide for interactions among individuals, but it is not a useful <italic>political</italic> guide. It is ‘not unfair’, Pogge believes, to attribute to Kant’s ethics the ‘rather naïve hope’ that ‘if only everyone could be brought to make individual practical decisions in terms of the categorical imperative, the problem of social justice would take care of itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 1981</xref>: 58). The CI can secure the ethical behavior of each individual, but this does not mean securing political justice. This is true not only because distributive political questions remain even when all individuals act out of duty, but also because the scope of individual freedom that all must respect remains undefined: ‘the moral law underdetermines the realm of ends’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 1997</xref>: 378).</p>
<p>However, according to Pogge’s reading, Kant’s political writings (in particular, <italic>The Metaphysics of Morals</italic>) avoid the problematic thought that political justice can be reduced to aggregate ethics. Kant is cognizant here that political disputes will remain, ‘however well disposed and law-abiding men might be’ (1996a: 312, Section 44), in the private realm. This recognition generates the idea that institutions are indispensable: even if I wish to act for the sake of duty and fully respect your rights, I do not know how to do this outside of an institutional framework specifying <italic>what</italic> your full rights and my correlative duties are. Pogge can therefore deduce from Kant’s political writings, first, that ‘morality can be realized only in a juridical state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 1997</xref>: 379)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1470594X12447784">13</xref>
</sup> and, second, that this realization is a matter of a <italic>negative</italic> rather than a positive duty: we clearly ‘need shared institutions to avoid invading one another’s freedom. And we [therefore] have a <italic>negative</italic> duty to comply with such existing institutions, whenever non-compliance can succeed only if like non-compliance by others is constrained’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 2002c</xref>: 137, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Once individuals have a negative rather than positive duty toward institutions, they also become right-bearers (and therefore also bearers of negative duties to respect rights) by virtue of cooperating with others under a shared coercive institutional order. For Pogge, this means that human rights represent ‘<italic>moral claims on the organization of one’s society</italic>’. By asserting a human right to X, one is asserting that<disp-quote>
<p>any society or other social system, insofar as this is reasonably possible, ought to be so (re)organized that all its members have secure access to X, with ‘security’ always understood as especially sensitive to person’s risk of being denied X or deprived of X officially: by the government or its agents or officials. Avoiding security of access, beyond certain plausibly attainable thresholds, constitutes official disrespect and stains the society’s human-rights record. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 2002c</xref>: 64)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1470594X12447784">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
The second step consists of applying this institutional understanding of rights and correlative duties to the global level. Unsurprisingly, this step is inspired by Kantian cosmopolitanism. Explicitly evoking Kant’s terms, Pogge asserts that as long as ‘humankind does not enter a “universal cosmopolitan condition”, does not organize itself into a “moral whole” … it shall not be moralized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 1997</xref>: 380; quoting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470594X12447784">Kant, 1991</xref>: 8:21, 8:26, 8:28). It follows that the institutional understanding of human rights cannot be territorially limited – that ‘persons share responsibility for official disrespect of human rights within any coercive institutional order they are involved in upholding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 2002c</xref>: 64). Empirically, this insistence generates claims about global justice since Pogge considers it evident that a coercive institutional global order exists: ‘it is undeniable that, today and in the foreseeable future, there is a global institutional order that importantly affects the options and incentives societies and their rulers face in their relations with one another and even affects profoundly the domestic institutions and cultures of especially the smaller and weaker societies’ (2003–04: 1751–2).</p>
<p>The third and last step relies on the preceding claims to evaluate the present global institutional order as manifestly unjust. Pogge targets global regulations and organizations, from the World Trade Organization (WTO) through the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the G8, as the main foundations of this order, and also as the main culprits skewing it in favor of the global rich against the global poor, in ways ranging from the rules allocating control over national resources (discussed below) to ‘quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, export credits, and huge subsidies to domestic producers … that poor countries are not permitted, or cannot afford, to match’ (2007b: 44). These and other global institutions lock poor nations into a devastating bargaining power disadvantage. Pogge judges this to be <italic>criminal</italic> unfairness on the part of the imposing affluent nations, seeing it as a key contributor to the problem of extreme poverty. Global institutions, he insists, limit, in a clear and foreseeable way, the poor’s access to the provisions of the UDHR, thus sharing much of the blame for the poverty-related death toll that ‘matches, every three years, the entire death toll of World War II, concentration camps and gulags included’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 2007b</xref>: 30). Pogge is adamant we can design a different institutional order that will generate very different outcomes for the global poor, and secure their access to the UDHR provisions, merely through ‘minor modifications in the global order that would entail at most slight reductions in the incomes of the affluent’ (2007b: 30). By failing to do so, we monumentally violate our negative duty of justice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1470594X12447784">
<title>1.2. Missing rigorist features</title>
<p>Having sketched Pogge’s conception of negative duties, I turn to challenge this conception in two main stages. In this subsection, I temporarily assume that Pogge’s derivation of his variant of negative duties succeeds, and question the value of this success. In the next section, I will argue that the derivation itself does not succeed.</p>
<p>Let us begin with what Pogge’s argument fails to achieve. Pogge’s account fails to maintain the distinctive features of negative duties which generate their strategic advantages. More specifically, Pogge deprives negative duties of their distinctiveness by depriving them of their rigorism. Rigorism disappears since Pogge’s negative duties are not <italic>agent-oriented</italic>, but <italic>outcome-oriented</italic>.</p>
<p>To evince the impact of this shift, let us compare two domestic economic cases. One is a familiar negative duty: the agent-oriented duty not to steal. The other is the outcome-oriented responsibility that democratic citizens have to design the basic structure of their society in a way that will ensure their fellow citizens’ access to certain material goods. Pogge argues that the latter responsibility must also be conceived as a <italic>negative</italic> duty.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1470594X12447784">15</xref>
</sup> Yet this responsibility, being outcome-centered rather than agent-centered, lacks at least four rigorist features that give negative duties particular weight.</p>
<p>First, one could argue that negative duties derive much of their distinctiveness from being <italic>agent-specific</italic> in a way that isolates each of their bearers from others’ conduct. One’s negative duty holds independently of what anyone else may or may not do. But, examining our two examples, we find that only the rigorist duty not to steal is agent-specific; the responsibility to design a just basic structure is not. Second, if each agent bearing negative duties can satisfy them independently of others’ behavior, then the duty must be <italic>action-specific</italic>. This feature also applies only to the duty not to steal and not to the institutional responsibility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1470594X12447784">16</xref>
</sup> Jack knows exactly what he must (not) do in order to avoid stealing from Jill. But no specific action on his part can guarantee political institutions that will provide Jill with access to material goods.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1470594X12447784">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Third, concurrently, negative duties also derive much of their force from being <italic>finite</italic>. Jack knows he has satisfied his negative duty once he has avoided theft, regardless of how others behave. But the responsibility to design institutions that secure access to resources cannot be nearly as finite: an endless number of events outside of Jack’s control may alter institutional conditions and, specifically, Jill’s access. Under Pogge’s view, such alterations can make a fulfilled negative duty <italic>un</italic>fulfilled: since the institutional responsibility is to ensure a certain outcome, once the outcome is not present the responsibility is not satisfied. Yet it makes little sense to say that a satisfied negative duty can become unfulfilled because of anything other than the responsible agent’s actions. That other citizens voted to abolish progressive taxation or that a natural disaster has struck (a noninstitutional factor that Pogge’s view arguably cannot conceptualize)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1470594X12447784">18</xref>
</sup> may change Jill’s economic fortunes, but cannot plausibly change the status of Jack’s negative duty toward her, assuming <italic>he</italic> did not change his conduct. We would ordinarily think that whether Jack satisfies his negative duty toward Jill cannot depend on what outcomes Jill enjoys: this question depends <italic>only</italic> on whether Jack himself is harming Jill (here, by stealing from her). Negative duties are especially strong also because only the responsible agent can influence their status.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1470594X12447784">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, one could argue that negative duties are particularly powerful because they are <italic>binary</italic>. I either satisfied my negative duty entirely or not at all: I attacked you or I did not. I cannot ‘semi-assault’ anyone. Jack tries to steal from Jill or he does not. There is no ‘middle category’ here. The institutional responsibility, in contrast, is a continuum rather than a binary matter – it can allow for gradations in a way that a standard negative duty cannot. Jack’s institutional responsibility of justice toward Jill can be <italic>partially</italic> fulfilled.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1470594X12447784">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>These rigorist points should already cast doubt on Pogge’s effort to employ the superior force of negative duties. Even if Pogge’s derivation of his duties succeeds, he still cannot achieve what he needs to achieve.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1470594X12447784">21</xref>
</sup> But in order fully to address Pogge’s negative duties, one must also analyze their derivation – the logic grounding them. I now turn to argue that this logic does not hold.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1470594X12447784">
<title>1.3. Does Pogge’s logic work?</title>
<p>Pogge’s logic, as the presentation above indicates, hinges on the claim that agents cannot know crucial parts of their rights and correlative negative duties without shared institutions. I wish to dispute the relevance of this claim for global institutions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1470594X12447784">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>One important problem with the claim follows from the core value of normative individualism, to which Pogge, like all liberals, is committed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1470594X12447784">23</xref>
</sup> If what we want of institutions is to specify (and enforce) the full range of individuals’ rights and duties, and if this is what domestic institutions do, why do we need global institutions? At the very least, why do we need to assume a direct analogy between the functions of domestic and global institutions? If domestic institutions already ‘take care’ of individuals’ needs, we simply do not need robust global ones.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1470594X12447784">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Now, a Poggean response might be that just as we need a domestic institutional order to know the rights and duties of individuals operating within it, so we need a global institutional order to know the rights and duties of <italic>states</italic> operating within it. I suspect that such a response cannot be reconciled with normative individualism. But even putting this aside, the analogy does not hold. The main reason is the different role that sovereignty plays at the domestic and the global level. I agree with Pogge that sovereign institutions are required to specify the full range of individuals’ rights and correlative duties, particularly when it comes to questions of property that are obviously a central concern here; a sovereign body politic is indeed required to define citizens’ property rights. Yet sovereignty itself represents a claim to property in at least three ways that generate a <italic>disanalogy</italic> between the domestic and the global.</p>
<p>First, if it is the task of sovereign institutions to specify the scope and content of citizens’ property rights, then the sovereign body politic itself must be seen as having prior ownership of the resources within its jurisdiction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1470594X12447784">25</xref>
</sup> Second, this jurisdiction must remain territorially limited. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470594X12447784">Pogge (1992</xref>) argues that we can imagine different modes of sovereignty than those that exist today, for instance, dispersing sovereignty both below and above the level of current states. Yet as long as Pogge (like the vast majority of cosmopolitans) does not defend world government, there can be no global enforcer, and without such an enforcer, separate sovereign powers must remain, protecting separate territories, that is, separate properties.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1470594X12447784">26</xref>
</sup> Third, the property rights embodied in state sovereignty can be known prior to global institutions since they are similar in an important sense to individuals’ bodily rights. We clearly do not need institutions to know that persons have an exclusive right over their body. Infringements upon bodily integrity constitute a <italic>human</italic> right violation – a right that all human beings have qua human beings, independently of any institutions they may or may not share.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1470594X12447784">27</xref>
</sup> Analogously, states’ rights to territorial integrity <italic>precede</italic> global institutions. A body politic does not need to share global institutions with another sovereign community to know that the other community has the right not to be involuntarily deprived of its territory or the resources it contains.</p>
<p>This connection between property and sovereignty will later prove crucial in a very direct manner, but at this point I wish to highlight the fact that sovereignty matters also in a broader sense, relating to democratic global responsibility as a whole. Domestically, sovereign responsibility is active and collective: citizens collectively specify and enforce the full range of their rights and duties as subjects. Globally, however, sovereign responsibility is predominantly passive and individual: a negative duty of forbearance on the part of a unitary agent to avoid impinging upon the autonomy of another such agent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1470594X12447784">28</xref>
</sup> The core of global politics is currently, and is likely to remain (given the enduring lack of a global sovereign), inter<italic>national</italic> politics, that is, <italic>a web of bilateral interactions between unitary agents</italic>.</p>
<p>Concrete examples of this picture follow, but I should first note why this picture is so significant. If it is accurate, then in order to discern global ‘harm’ we ought to take precisely the Kantian step that Pogge has argued we should <italic>not</italic> take: to disaggregate core political questions of global justice into separate questions of individual morality. We need to break down global problems into the separate ethical behavior of each agent, with the relevant agents being not individuals, but democratic states. Such a breakdown would mean returning to <italic>rigorist</italic> duties – ones that are agent-centered rather than outcome-centered. This return, I will now argue through examples, is the only way to employ the distinct global force of negative duties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470594X12447784">
<title>1.4. Global negative duties as aggregate ethics</title>
<p>Negative duties cannot exist unless specific agents are identified as responsible for specific harms. In international affairs, states are held responsible as unitary agents for the harms they cause, and this responsibility is rigorist, agent-oriented, and independent of global institutions. War represents the most classic example. When country X invades country Y with predatory intent, it violates not Pogge’s version of negative duties, but a classic rigorist duty not to harm another specific agent. There is no need for overarching global institutions to define such an act as ‘harm’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1470594X12447784">29</xref>
</sup> But Pogge’s outcome-oriented duties also cannot feature when third-party responsibility is considered. If country X invades country Y, with country Z doing nothing to help the victim, there might be a moral failure here on the part of Z, but it cannot be understood in terms of negative duties, even if the new global order resulting from the aggression is indeed less just. The worsening of the global state of affairs cannot imply a negative-duties problem for the sovereign citizens of country Z. It is simply not <italic>their</italic> government that is the culprit. Not only as multiple individuals, but also as a unitary agent <italic>they</italic> did not act aggressively. They might be violating a positive duty, but not a negative duty: they are failing to help, but they are not <italic>harming</italic>.</p>
<p>Yet Pogge’s account encounters difficulties even if it is one’s own government which is harming. Even here, Pogge’s conclusion would still be different from ‘forbearance’. Imagine you are a citizen of a democratic country that, during the 1980s, decided to boycott the apartheid regime of South Africa, simply in order not to be complicit in any way in the survival of a morally abominable government. Most would think that this step should satisfy any and all possible negative duties. The citizens of the boycotting country, as a collective agent, have decided to withdraw any form of support for a clearly illegitimate regime; therefore they can no longer be held accountable for its presence. Pogge can respond to this scenario in two ways. First, he can accept such a boycott as satisfying negative duties. But this means accepting a <italic>rigorist</italic> duty of forbearance, one that is agent-oriented rather than outcome-oriented. This duty says <italic>nothing</italic> about changing outcomes – it does not require changing other agents’ behavior, broader institutions, or the victim’s condition.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Pogge may insist that the boycotting country does not yet comply with its negative duties. But then his approach seems, yet again, too open-ended. It fails to capture the powerful moral intuition according to which if an agent ceases to violate the rights of another (and, where applicable, offers due compensation), its negative duty not to harm is satisfied, <italic>independently</italic> of any broader change. It might certainly be possible to establish that democracies have a duty to contribute to the reform of regimes they already boycott. But such a duty simply cannot be defined as a <italic>negative</italic> one. Insofar as Pogge wants to appeal only to negative duties, a rigorist duty to disengage from illegitimate regimes will have to do.</p>
<p>Now, Pogge might grant the above points when it comes to issues such as war and peace or particular cases such as an apartheid regime, yet insist on the necessity of his brand of negative duties when it comes to global trade. But if a society’s negative duty can only be to avoid certain actions rather than to bring about a state of affairs, this insistence is also unconvincing. Trade can be seen as a morally neutral possibility, not as a subject of justice. Country X does not have a ‘negative duty’ to trade with country Y, just as you do not have a ‘negative duty’ to trade with your neighbor. Threatening your neighbor <italic>will</italic> be violating negative duties, yet global trade, in Michael Blake’s words, ‘is a matter of offers, not of threats’ (2001: 292).</p>
<p>Pogge will object that many of the patterns of current global trade do amount to threats. If you make your neighbor “an offer he cannot refuse” then you are threatening her in a morally damning way, and this, Pogge argues, is what affluent countries do vis-a-vis the poor nations, for instance, when it comes to WTO rules:<disp-quote>
<p>Poor countries need trade for development. They do not get <italic>fair trading opportunities</italic> under the WTO regime; but one that failed to sign up would find its trading opportunities even more severely curtailed. Any poor country is forced to decide about whether to sign up to the WTO rules against the background of other rules that it cannot escape that make it extremely costly not to sign up. One such rule is, for instance, that the people and firms of poor countries may not freely offer their products and services to people in rich countries [while] the property rights of rich country corporations must be respected and enforced … poor-country governments must help collect rents for [the rich] corporations, thereby driving up the cost of pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs for their own populations … this calamity is due to a rule that the rich countries <italic>impose unilaterally</italic>. (2007b: 43)</p>
</disp-quote>
There is surely much truth in this depiction of global trade. Yet, however accurate factually, this picture, once more, cannot give rise to negative duties in any recognizable sense. The expressions ‘fair trading opportunities’ and ‘impose unilaterally’ show why. Had there been a single sovereign community unilaterally imposing the WTO rules on the world’s deprived, the claim from negative duties might begin to seem more plausible. But given international anarchy, there can be no such single imposer, and therefore no <italic>agent-centered</italic> duty.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1470594X12447784">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Mirroring the domestic criticism offered above, we can add that all of the other features that distinguish negative duties are absent as well, given that ‘fair trade’ for Pogge must ‘secure’ for the world’s poor access to the items listed in the UDHR. The duty to reform global trade so as to fulfill the UDHR criteria for the world’s deprived is <italic>not</italic> action-specific, <italic>not</italic> finite, and <italic>not</italic> binary.</p>
<p>Given the huge number of agents that take part in the global institutional order, the institutional responsibility here is not action-specific, since no particular modification of the global order, surely not by any single agent operating alone, can directly ensure the required state of affairs. Pogge, as noted above, insists that minor modifications in the global order would suffice to fulfill the rights enumerated in the UDHR. Yet several critics continue to maintain that there is little empirical backing for this claim, in particular because it cannot be shown that global reforms would suffice to induce domestic political change.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1470594X12447784">31</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, with a billion persons starving around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 2007b</xref>: 30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1470594X12447784">UN General Assembly, 2009</xref>), the gap between the UDHR standards and current conditions is so enormous that it is far from clear that any specific agent can do nearly ‘enough’, can reach by itself the goal Pogge sets of halving extreme poverty by changing its core causes. Finally, the very possibility of gradations here shows why the institutional responsibility cannot be binary. None of this is to say that many of the reforms Pogge advocates (for instance, regarding the aforementioned trade quotas, tariffs, and subsidies) should not be undertaken with the hope for better outcomes for the poor. But, given all the above, such reforms are much more appropriately seen as positive rather than negative duties.</p>
<p>Let us take stock. We have seen that unlike Pogge’s view, the rigorist position captures the distinctive features of negative duties. We have also seen why global negative duties must be rigorist. This rigorism lays the basis for disaggregating global politics, as a web of bilateral ties, into the distinct interactions of specific states. Now we need to ask what global reform ought to stem from the rigorist view of global politics as aggregate ethics.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-1470594X12447784">
<title>2. Rigorist reform: national property and global theft</title>
<p>I argue that dramatic global change can and should be grounded in rigorist duties. Such change does not require overhauling global institutions. Rather, it consists of affirming in practice a specific right already recognized formally in existing international institutions: a people’s right to control the resources found within its territory. This right is founded on sovereign property in the most direct, literal sense.</p>
<p>The idea that the people legitimately own their state’s resources, including its revenue, its territory, and the natural resources that the territory contains, is pivotal for the basic norms of global politics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1470594X12447784">32</xref>
</sup> These norms also fit simple common judgment: we often say that certain goods and territories rightly ‘belong’ to this or that nation, and when we do so, we necessarily speak in the language of national ownership.</p>
<p>Three points follow. First, national resources cannot be legitimately taken through violence by <italic>anyone</italic> – not by foreigners, but also not by rulers. <italic>National resources belong to the people, not to those who wield effective power.</italic> Unless the body politic legitimately (that is, democratically) transfers ownership over its resources to individual agents, these resources may not be taken from it. Bashar al-Assad, for instance, cannot acquire ownership of the oil of the Syrian people simply because he has enough tanks, any more than I can acquire ownership of your house simply because I manage to keep you out of it. Such cases present not legitimate sale and ownership, but theft, if not armed robbery.</p>
<p>Second, there are significant negative duties imposed here on purchasers. If I sell the house I robbed from you to a millionaire who <italic>knows</italic> I have no valid title to the house, the millionaire, just like me, is violating a negative duty – in his case, not to be materially complicit in theft. Third, both the robbery and the complicity can be understood as rigorist problems. These are violations of a truly negative duty – one that can be satisfied independently of how other agents behave exactly because it is agent-specific, action-specific, finite, and binary.</p>
<p>That is why it is especially important for our purposes that complicity in theft of other peoples’ resources is crucial to Pogge’s <italic>own indictment</italic> of the global economic order. Key to this indictment is the claim that while national property rights are recognized on paper, they are systemically violated in practice. Governments worldwide confer a ‘resource privilege’ on every regime they officially recognize, which ‘includes the power to effect legally valid transfers of ownership rights’, producing a stark contradiction with any tenable understanding of state property as owned by the people:<disp-quote>
<p>A group that overpowers the guards and takes control of a warehouse may be able to give some of the merchandise to others, accepting money in exchange. But the fence who pays them becomes merely the possessor, not the owner, of the loot. Contrast this with a group that overpowers an elected government and takes control of a country. Such a group, too, can give away some of the country’s natural resources, accepting money in exchange. In this case, however, the purchaser acquires not merely possession, but all the rights and liberties of ownership, which are supposed to be – and actually are – protected and enforced by all other states’ courts and police forces. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 2005b</xref>: 737)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This, however, is not just a global problem. It is also, fundamentally, <italic>our</italic> problem. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470594X12447784">Pogge (2008</xref>: 142, 148) put it even more recently:<disp-quote>
<p>We authorize our firms to acquire natural resources from tyrants and we protect their property rights in resources so acquired. We purchase what our firms produce out of such resources and thereby encourage them to act as authorized. In these ways we recognize the authority of tyrants to sell the natural resources of the countries they rule … How [for instance] can there be a moral difference between paying the Saudi clan or General Sani Abacha … and stealing the oil outright?<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1470594X12447784">33</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
We, through our elected governments, therefore harm other nations by illicitly trading in what belongs to them. This charge is simple and powerful. Yet there is no need to base it on Pogge’s variant of negative duties. Rather, the charge can and should be completely grounded in rigorism: <italic>each</italic> body politic as a unitary agent has a duty not to be complicit in theft from another. <italic>Each</italic> affluent democracy ought to outlaw such illicit trade within its jurisdiction – boycotting and refusing to recognize dictators as legitimate in selling their peoples’ resources. This duty holds <italic>independently</italic> of the behavior of other democracies, or the hopes for reform of the boycotted regimes. One ought not to steal, independently of the prospects for improvement in the victim’s condition, and even if others continue stealing. The normative rationale here therefore comes exactly from the Kantian rigorism that Pogge marginalizes: the conviction that there <italic>is</italic> inherent moral value in doing what is right for the sake of duty, even when all others continue to do what is wrong. This is the basis of global rigorist reform.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1470594X12447784">
<title>3. The advantages of global rigorism</title>
<p>There are several normative, empirical, and strategic advantages (joining the arguments already made) to thinking about global reform in rigorist rather than in Pogge’s terms. First, normatively, the insistence throughout that rigorist negative duties are far weightier than institutional responsibilities receives here concrete expression, in the comparison between the problem of fair trade and that of illicit trade. Negotiating unfairly might be wrong, yet, Bertolt Brecht notwithstanding, material complicity in theft (at times even armed robbery) is surely much worse.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1470594X12447784">34</xref>
</sup> This intuitive distinction is strengthened by the fact that while the theft allegation can reasonably be met independently of the fairness problem, the opposite is not true. It can make sense to stop our complicity in the theft of national resources, by prohibiting our corporations from trading with those regimes that clearly rob their population’s resources, even without a renegotiation of WTO and IMF regulations, for instance; but it makes little sense to reform these regulations while at the same time continuing trade with regimes that only use it to get richer at their population’s expense. Whatever ‘fairness’ in global trade might mean, the moral imperative for each democracy to amend its own particular interactions is clearly more immediate: ‘the priority in reforming global commerce’, as Leif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1470594X12447784">Wenar (2008</xref>: 2) eloquently writes, ‘is not to replace “free trade” with “fair trade.” The priority is to create trade where now there is theft.’ Continuing this theft while pursuing fair trade reform is akin to providing water drops to the deprived with one hand while taking their oceans with the other.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1470594X12447784">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To demonstrate the problem of global theft and robbery and to justify these strong terms, it might be useful to consider some all-too-vivid empirical examples. Theft is evident even in supposedly ‘benign’ dictatorships: consider Egypt, where the people are still looking for the fortune that the now-deposed Mubarak stashed in western bank accounts, or Russia, regarding which only the foreign press is free to report that, even under a conservative estimate that has in all likelihood been exceeded already, strongman Vladimir Putin’s holdings are worth US$40 billion, a sum unlikely to have resulted solely from prudent investment policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470594X12447784">Harding, 2007</xref>). Yet our complicity in such massive theft is even worse when considering how it has been intimately connected, in other countries, to some of the most horrific political conditions imaginable. Consider children abducted from schools by the tens of thousands to serve as slaves picking Uzbekistan’s ‘white gold’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470594X12447784">Mathiason, 2009</xref>); child-soldiers in Sierra Leone trained to shoot at the local population and drive it away from diamond fields; Equatorial Guinea’s dictator, richer than the Queen of England, buying personal jets with oil revenue ensured by western corporations while three-quarters of his population is living on less than a dollar a day; the most dreadful atrocities in Darfur, funded by the same ‘black gold’ going to the same corporations; and ‘Africa’s world war’ in the Congo, where women are raped with bayonets and clubs by militiamen who kill more than a thousand people every day, ‘fighting over the minerals used to make chips for cell phones and laptops’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1470594X12447784">Wenar, 2008</xref>: 6; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470594X12447784">Nili, 2011c</xref>).</p>
<p>In all of these cases, so badly stricken by the man-made ‘resource curse’, our violation of basic rigorist duties is dramatically tangible. Moreover, the conviction that this problem should be the focus of our efforts is strengthened, not weakened, by its sheer scale. Employing only the worst category of the Freedom House index to designate the regimes that clearly steal their population’s resources and looking solely at oil imports into the USA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1470594X12447784">Wenar (2008</xref>: 25) finds that<disp-quote>
<p>international corporations illicitly transport into the United States over 600 million barrels of oil each year. This is 12.7 percent of U.S. oil imports: more than one barrel in eight. Most of this petroleum is refined into gasoline and diesel; the rest is used in making a vast range of consumer products from clothing, cosmetics, and medicines to toys, asphalt, and ink. Even under empirical assumptions that are favorable to the international resource corporations, and even within a very permissive construal of the legal rules, it is beyond doubt that there is a massive flow of stolen goods into the United States every year.</p>
</disp-quote>
Now, Pogge would of course endorse a strong commitment to change this condition. Yet focusing on such a commitment (as we should do on rigorist grounds) would seriously marginalize Poggean duties not only philosophically, but also practically.</p>
<p>First, to continue with the empirical dimension, assuming that the urgency of each democracy tending to its own complicity in oppressors’ theft is recognized, it is not clear how much room is left for the kind of reform generated by Pogge’s distinct brand of negative duties. The impact of the elimination of protectionist trade barriers,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1470594X12447784">36</xref>
</sup> for instance, might very well be eclipsed by a democratic decision to boycott robbing regimes worldwide. Second, the rigorist reform manages to bracket the empirical challenge repeatedly posed to Pogge as to whether the changes he advocates will really induce domestic change on the scale to which he aspires. Under the rigorist view this problem does not arise, since the motivation for undertaking reform is fundamentally inward-looking: the demand is to stop stealing simply because stealing is wrong.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1470594X12447784">37</xref>
</sup> This demand no longer hinges on the ability to change others’ condition.</p>
<p>These differences also shift the reform’s strategic focus. First, the rigorist alternative produces a call for drastic change on the basis of premises that statists can accept. Usually, the more ‘statist’ one is in the global justice debate, the more one tends to endorse the status quo. If a call for unprecedented change, in the form of democracies seeking to disengage from dictatorships, can be based on the most statist premises, such as national property, then there is a possibility of an ‘overlapping consensus’ on the need for major global transformation that is more solid than that which Pogge’s version of negative duties can achieve.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1470594X12447784">38</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A second strategic benefit follows directly from the rigorist regaining of the force of negative duties, and has to do with collective action problems. It might be impossible for a single country unilaterally to guarantee any standard of fairness in international commerce as a whole, but it is possible for a single country to decide not to partake in theft. Such rigorism does not play any part in Pogge’s proposal for how to handle the property rights problem, precisely because he conceives the problem in outcome-oriented rather than agent-oriented terms. It follows that the rigorist alternative can push for <italic>immediate steps</italic> more easily than Pogge, since it frees particular democracies from dependence on others’ behavior. Pogge himself (2002c: 128, 212–3) recognizes the threat that the ‘sucker exemption’ (or ‘buck-passing’) problem of collective action poses to his theory: even when all relevant parties agree that ‘something needs to be done’, there is rarely agreement about <italic>who</italic> should ‘do something’. Rigorism avoids the problem: it leaves no doubt as to where the buck stops.</p>
<p>However, this avoidance seems to come at a price. As portrayed so far, rigorist cosmopolitanism <italic>does</italic> seem to display excessive attention to our own moral worth, and little if any attention to others’ practical needs. Most importantly, I have said nothing so far to explain what duties we <italic>do</italic> have regarding extreme poverty globally. This objection must be handled, since a complete indifference to poverty would indeed exhibit the aloofness that Pogge identifies in ‘excessive’ preoccupation with one’s ‘clean hands’ (1981: 64).</p>

<title>4. Anticipating Poggean objections</title>
<sec id="section9-1470594X12447784">
<title>4.1. Rigorist cosmopolitanism as broadly deontological</title>
<p>Rigorist cosmopolitanism anticipates the objection from extreme poverty by adopting a broadly rather than purely deontological approach.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1470594X12447784">39</xref>
</sup> This cosmopolitanism is broadly deontological in the sense that it takes extremities into account: though we have a duty not to cooperate with severely repressive regimes, there are very specific exceptional circumstances which both generate positive duties and allow us to override our negative duties. These circumstances include a <italic>massive threat of death, enslavement, or damage to bodily integrity</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1470594X12447784">40</xref>
</sup> These extremities derive from the following Kantian question: can one consistently will a world in which others do not help to prevent death on a massive scale, the threat to bodily integrity or enslavement at a negligible cost for themselves?</p>
<p>The answer ought to be ‘no’. One needs to exercise reason in order to ask this question as a real guidance for action, but anyone who is enslaved, who is commanded by the reason of another, let alone anyone who is dead, cannot use reason in such a way to begin with. Here reason effectively obliterates itself to a degree that constitutes a contradiction in will.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1470594X12447784">41</xref>
</sup> Death, damage to the body, and enslavement are therefore fundamentally different from any other form of suffering. And so, to return specifically to the global context, it is not clear that we have an immediate duty to provide education, for instance, to a distant villager neglected by a government that steals its people’s resources. But we do have a positive immediate duty to provide that villager’s region, within reasonable costs, with food and medical equipment in case of dire need.</p>
<p>Two differences in comparison with Pogge are worth stressing here. First, unlike Pogge, the rigorist position distinguishes much more explicitly between <italic>poverty as such and poverty as a threat to survival</italic>. The immediate threat is poverty as a threat to survival, and this problem must be countered with massive humanitarian support. Second, in contrast to Pogge, I stress that our duty to provide such support <italic>must</italic> also be a <italic>positive</italic> one: the violation of negative duties is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for us to tend to the survival of the 50,000 people who currently die of poverty every day.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1470594X12447784">42</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Admittedly, the rigorist marginalization of poverty might seem strongly counterintuitive. However, it can in fact draw on Pogge’s own theory. Discussing justice related to health, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470594X12447784">Pogge (2002b</xref>: 71) is emphatic that ‘the strength of our moral reasons to prevent or to mitigate particular medical conditions does not depend only on what one might call distributional factors [the impact of our policy on others] … Rather, it depends also on relational factors, that is, on how <italic>we</italic> are related to the medical conditions they suffer.’ Concurrently, ‘treating recipients justly does not’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470594X12447784">Pogge (2002b</xref>: 77) insists:<disp-quote>
<p>boil down to promoting the best distribution among them – what matters is how social rules <italic>treat</italic>, not how they <italic>affect</italic>, the set of recipients. This simple thought has been remarkably neglected in contemporary work on social justice. It is not surprising, of course, that it plays no role in consequentialist theorizing. Consequentialists, after all, hold that social rules (as well as persons and their conduct) should be judged by their impact on the overall outcome, irrespective of how they produce these effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1470594X12447784">43</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
Unsurprisingly, Pogge makes this deontological insistence only within his account of negative duties. Yet the ‘relational’ insight has an even more natural place within the rigorist account, demanding of each democracy that it focus on how <italic>it treats</italic> others, independently of how others are <italic>affected</italic> materially. What justification can Pogge have for avoiding this rigorist rationale? At the most practical level, the justification would likely be that the rigorist view is unfeasible, since no country in the world enjoys the means necessary to disengage unilaterally from dictatorships.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1470594X12447784">44</xref>

<sec id="section10-1470594X12447784">
<title>4.2. The feasibility of rigorism</title>
<p>The defense of the rigorist alternative as a feasible project begins by limiting the scope of the objection. First, with regards to powerful dictatorships, the rigorist perspective does not ignore at all the fact that only a critical mass of democracies, working together, can make rigorism possible. The simple answer is that the resulting coordination problems between democracies are exactly those facing Pogge’s view as well, as Pogge himself admits (2002c: 128, 212–3). Second, there are hardly any feasibility issues when one is talking about minor autocracies. Here the duty not to be complicit in the regime’s theft <italic>can</italic> be fulfilled by each democracy separately (to recall the ‘sucker exemption’ avoidance).</p>
<p>Yet perhaps someone arguing on Pogge’s behalf would also claim that we cannot limit our duties toward distant others to ensuring their survival, bodily integrity, and freedom from slavery – that working to ensure their existence does not really ensure anything like a truly human life, even if these are necessary conditions for such life that are consistent in their deontological basis. But here it is the rigorist alternative that can claim greater feasibility. It is highly questionable that affluent nations can ensure by themselves the full UDHR standards for the world’s deprived,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1470594X12447784">45</xref>
</sup> especially given that many of the UDHR components (for instance, access to education) clearly depend on domestic institutions that outsiders cannot replace or easily alter. Subjecting democracies’ conduct to the UDHR goals thus exemplifies the indeterminacy of the will (to return to the Kantian vocabulary) once it is made contingent upon achieving consequences that are <italic>beyond</italic> the agent’s sphere of control. In contrast, the conditions necessary for the rigorist view are far more attainable, since they depend solely upon the affluent democracies themselves.</p>
<p>This is true, first, in terms of assistance to others. Today, humanitarian assistance, understood most robustly, can prevent at least the deadly results of poverty, even if many around the world remain very poor indeed, and even when discussing, specifically, the practical difficulties of providing support for populations living under boycotted regimes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1470594X12447784">46</xref>
</sup> Second, one of the main reasons for this confidence is the unprecedented prominence of liberal democracies in world affairs, which is crucial also with regard to the changes democracies must undertake before they can disengage from powerful and (particularly) oil-rich dictatorships. These changes can be pursued by democracies possessing the vast majority of the world’s economic and technological resources,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1470594X12447784">47</xref>
</sup> who can commit themselves, for example, to developing alternative energy sources.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1470594X12447784">48</xref>
</sup> The democratic duty not to be complicit in dictators’ theft therefore cannot be discounted simply on ‘feasibility grounds’. To say ‘We wish we could act morally, but this will require too much effort given existing conditions’ is surely, from a Kantian viewpoint, self-incurred immaturity – the exact opposite of enlightenment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1470594X12447784">49</xref>
</sup> Such abdication of moral responsibility is not sober pragmatism, but plain moral laziness, especially given democracies’ power.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1470594X12447784">50</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It should be clear that this emphasis on democracies’ aggregated geopolitical clout is not in any way a concession toward Pogge’s view: such an emphasis is perfectly compatible with a rigorist understanding of global politics, conceiving the relations between states mainly as a web of bilateral interactions between specific unitary agents. Of course, boycotts have a much higher likelihood of taking place and being sustained through a shared democratic decision to pursue global institutional change. But they can also be understood as an aggregation of decisions by individual states that coincide due to shared values.</p>
<p>This perspective makes sense not only descriptively and strategically, but also normatively. From a rigorist viewpoint, a given democracy’s decision whether to legitimize oppressors must not be held hostage to how other democracies act. That the corporations of another country are allowed to maintain their complicity in de facto massive theft from the Congo does not give one’s own government license to condone such complicity when it comes to the corporations based in its territory. To be sure, a series of decisions by democracies not to allow their corporations to trade in stolen goods is likely to represent a concerted effort resulting from (often complex) coordination. But at bottom we still have here an aggregation of individual decisions by specific states as to how to interact with other individual states. Global reform remains primarily <italic>a rigorist matter</italic>.</p>
<p>This should suffice to defend the feasibility and coherence of rigorism, which calls for far-reaching global change even under profoundly statist premises. Yet a final Poggean objection against this statism can still be expected: that a theory which condemns a significant portion of humankind to bare survival, even if it displays a commitment to ensure this survival, cannot be seen as cosmopolitan at all. Instead of a conclusion, I now turn to an epistemological answer to this challenge, this time deriving Kantian inspiration from the relation between the duties of the present and the future.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1470594X12447784">
<title>5. Instead of a conclusion – What we know about global justice</title>
<p>The rigorist approach defended here is not indifferent to the broader autonomy of ‘distant’ others. Rigorist cosmopolitanism remains fully committed, just like Pogge, to the Kantian ideal of an entire humanity that is not merely surviving, but is fully autonomous and ‘thinks for itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 1997</xref>: 381). The highest end of humankind remains the complete development of reason ‘not in the individual’, or even in a specific portion of the globe, ‘but only in the species’ as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470594X12447784">Kant, 1991</xref>: 8:18); humanity’s final end must include ‘each rational being under the moral laws’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470594X12447784">Kant, 2000</xref>: 5:448). Yet, unlike Pogge, I believe we can approach this goal while maintaining Kantian rigorism as an essential political guide, since it tells us what our first, monumental step toward the highest good must be. This step follows from the inward look of the CI itself, and its rigorist demand that Pogge has repeatedly found problematic: for you ‘to focus upon your duties and me upon mine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 1997</xref>: 373) (extended here under the rigorist view to democratic societies).</p>
<p>This demand does not neglect the pursuit of others’ full autonomy. Rather, it calls for patience with regard to how to achieve this goal, due to epistemological reasons. The <italic>first</italic> step toward global justice must be stopping our own massive complicity in the illicit trade of illegitimate regimes. But this is certainly not the last one. My only claim is that <italic>we must be cautious since we cannot know what the second step will require</italic>. If the rigorist call for democratic disengagement from severely oppressive regimes is universalized (as it ought to be), the result would be an unprecedented democratic bloc. The rise of such a bloc would constitute nothing less than the most radical reorganization of international affairs in history. The implications of such disengagement will be so tremendous that we cannot even begin to recognize the picture that will follow. Perhaps at least some dictatorships, given the critical mass of democracies boycotting them, will collapse following democratic boycotts and pave the way for forms of government that treat man as ‘more than a machine, in a manner appropriate to his dignity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470594X12447784">Kant, 1996b</xref>: 8:42). But the call for a boycott <italic>cannot depend</italic> on such hopes. We can only speculate about the future, not conceptualize it. Too many basic facts remain unknown: trying to philosophize past world historical events before they occur is simply jumping ahead of our time.</p>
<p>This call for epistemic humility is accompanied by a Kantian recognition of the fact that in such a manifestly unjust world as ours, rigorism, even when specifying, as Pogge emphasizes, only what is permissible rather than obligatory (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470594X12447784">Pogge, 1998</xref>: 190; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470594X12447784">Korsgaard, 1998</xref>: 68), will suffice to guide us by fixing our attention on the many impermissible actions in which we are taking part. Thus, we can maintain the (ironically sad) hope that duty will point the way: ‘what one must do to remain on the path of duty … for that and thus for the final end reason always shines enough light ahead’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470594X12447784">Kant, 1996e</xref>: 8:370). At each step we ought to remain duty-bound: politics must, at each point, ‘bend its knee’ before morals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470594X12447784">Kant, 1996e</xref>: 8:386). Furthermore, it is <italic>our</italic> morals that must come first, not the morality of others – even if the hope remains that others will follow.</p>
<p>The conclusion, then, is that before reforming the world, we need to reform ourselves – not because of global institutions nor because of skepticism or indifference to the fate of others, but simply because doing what is right, even while others continue to do what is clearly wrong and even while it may not solve the problem of global justice immediately, is a precondition for addressing the problem. Achieving rightness is not righteousness nor petty moral luxury, but a tremendous feat. Reinvigorating Kantian ethics allows us to see the force and urgency of our own self-reform. Full global justice, humanity as a whole arriving at its highest end, will have to wait countless generations, if not forever. But our own change can and must start in our own lifetime.</p>

<p>Many people have generously given their time to comment on the themes of this article, whether in conversation or in writing. Vittorio Hosle entertained the original idea and fellow members of his Notre Dame Kant seminar (summer 2010) helped in forming the article’s early stages. Ruth Abbey, Yehonatan Alsheh, Elizabeth Baber, Faisal Baluch, Josh Cohen, Liz Ellis, Beth Gee, Eva Erman, Burke Hendrix, Kathrin Kranz, Alex Levitov, Lukas Meyer, Charles Mills, Uri Nili, Cameron O’Bannon, Dan Philpott, Verena Risse, Zach Shemtob, Ed Song, Felix Valenzuela, Ernesto Verdeja, Laura Weis, Paul Weithman, Leif Wenar, and Michael Zuckert all provided useful advice, as did three anonymous reviewers for this journal.

<p>One recalls <italic>Yes Prime Minister</italic>’s satirical portrayal of the Foreign Office response to appeals for help by small and weak societies: ‘We give them every support short of help … we follow the standard four stage strategy in time of crisis: in stage one we say nothing is going to happen. Stage two, we say something may be about to happen, but we should do nothing about it. In stage three, we say that maybe we should do something about it, but there’s nothing we <italic>can</italic> do. Stage four, we say maybe there was something we could have done, but it’s too late now.’ Whether there is a deep gap between satire and reality remains an open question.

<p>Like Pogge, I will be focusing on the responsibility of affluent democratic societies. I will generally use ‘democratic states’, the ‘democratic body politic’, and ‘democratic societies’ interchangeably. This focus assumes (again like Pogge) that democratic citizens ought to be held collectively responsible for their governments’ actions. I say more on this point below. The most recent account of democratic collective responsibility can be found in Anna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1470594X12447784">Stilz (2011</xref>).</p>

<p>The critics’ main accusations against Pogge currently include a problematic notion of individual responsibility for the structure of the global economy, a latent egalitarian threshold of just distribution that has to be much less minimalist than how it is presented by Pogge, and problematic predictions regarding expected poverty alleviation following changes in global rules and regulations. My argument has certain points in common with some of these criticisms, yet, to the best of my knowledge, its shift away from a focus on poverty is distinct. Some of the main examples of the Pogge literature preceding <italic>Thomas Pogge and His Critics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X12447784">Jagger, 2010</xref>) are Allen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470594X12447784">Patten (2005</xref>), Rowan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470594X12447784">Cruft (2005</xref>), Debra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1470594X12447784">Satz (2005</xref>), Mathias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1470594X12447784">Risse (2005</xref>), and Magnus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1470594X12447784">Reitberger (2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Objections from a Singer-like direction notwithstanding, I therefore think <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470594X12447784">Pogge (2010</xref>: 212) is exactly right when, for instance, he says: ‘Many believe that one has much stronger moral reasons to help neighbors in distress than to help total strangers who live very far from one’s own home and with whom one is sharing no bonds of language, culture, religion, or nationality. But few would endorse a similar gradient for our duties not to harm: the moral reasons to refrain from drunk driving do not become much weaker when we are briefly working in India or holidaying in Indonesia.’ Note that it is clearly consistent to assert both the <italic>existence</italic> of positive duties and the <italic>superior strength</italic> of negative duties.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-1470594X12447784">
<label> 6.</label>
<p>In making this claim I will be assuming throughout, with Pogge, a separation between <italic>duty</italic> and <italic>obligation</italic>. Certain <italic>obligations</italic> that one can voluntarily undertake do generate a commitment to ensure certain outcomes (I am under an obligation to supply you with pencils <italic>if</italic> I voluntarily signed a contract committing me to this, but I cannot have a negative <italic>duty</italic> to enter into such a contract).

<p>Since Pogge also gives significant weight to national property rights, I generally put aside here potential challenges as to the basis of these rights and the related original ‘constitution of the demos’. On the former point, see David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470594X12447784">Miller (2010</xref>) and Anna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1470594X12447784">Stilz (2009</xref>).

<p>This focus allows me to put aside here potential consequentialist responses to Pogge and arrange my discussion largely (even if not entirely) in deontological terms, without attempting in any way to settle broader disputes in normative ethics between deontological and consequentialist positions.</p>

<p>That is why I do not deal here with the vast secondary literature on Kant or make arguments as to what Kant ‘really meant’. In fact, many of the Kant quotations used here, for example, are also used by Pogge. In addition, I do endorse some of Pogge’s key arguments regarding necessary adaptations to Kant, for example, revising Kant’s untenable call for absolute submission to the existing regime as well as his outdated insistence on the indivisibility of sovereignty, which are attacked in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470594X12447784">Pogge (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1470594X12447784">2009</xref>).

<p>There is also a lasting indeterminacy here regarding the precise form of institutions.

<p>Indeed, our moral intuitions might point us to assist others at least when their very existence is in danger, even following a completely noninstitutional cause (due to a massive earthquake in Haiti, for instance). In the introduction to his <italic>National Responsibilities and Global Justice</italic>, David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470594X12447784">Miller (2007</xref>) also makes this point. Pogge might respond that a major part of Haiti’s tragedy follows from earlier institutional factors which carry much responsibility for the country’s abysmal poverty, and that we should shift attention from ‘assistance <italic>ex post</italic> [to] (often more cost-effective) prevention <italic>ex ante</italic>’ (2011).

<p>Someone might object that under conditions of extreme scarcity (for instance, a small desert community with a heavily constrained water supply), others’ use of scarce resources does influence my negative duties by shaping the constraints on my actions. But rather than debating whether ‘leaving enough and as good’ for others can really be defined as a negative duty, I simply make here the standard Rawlsian assumption of conditions of <italic>moderate</italic> scarcity.

<p>To give the most important example, an institutional order can be legitimate even if it is not fully just. Distributive justice might require robustly egalitarian arrangements, but a distribution that guarantees, for instance, a minimal ‘safety net’ can be legitimate (also because it stems from a legitimate democratic procedure) even when it is far from full justice. Furthermore, such a legitimate, yet unjust order still imposes strong negative duties on individual agents: its legitimacy still binds individual agents not to violate the property rights it defines.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn21-1470594X12447784">
<label>21.</label>
<p>It should be obvious, however, that I am not denying that institutional responsibilities can be weighty. Consider an example Pogge has used repeatedly: the institutional responsibility of white citizens for the perpetuation of slavery (compare 1989: 27). I fully agree with Pogge that I am deeply morally blameworthy not only if I personally hold slaves, but also if I am a sovereign member of a society whose laws explicitly defend slavery. In the latter case, I am failing to satisfy what might be called my ‘sovereign responsibility’. But why not say that this failure of mine is simply a failure to fulfill a particularly urgent <italic>positive</italic> duty or perhaps even say that institutional <italic>responsibilities</italic>, unlike interactional <italic>duties</italic>, cannot be neatly conceptualized through the positive/negative distinction (even while the sovereign body politic as a <italic>unitary agent</italic> can have clear ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ duties externally)?</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn22-1470594X12447784">
<label>22.</label>
<p>I note only parenthetically that libertarians (an important audience for Pogge) will dispute the claim for domestic politics. Since Pogge does not directly engage the idea of individual self-ownership, libertarians can deem his position question-begging. From a libertarian perspective, all rights and correlative duties are essentially pre-political and known prior to political institutions. It therefore remains unclear how self-owners should be understood as having negative duties toward any political institutions. I do not pursue this point further since I have no intention of defending libertarianism. As the argument will show in a moment, unlike libertarians I believe there is a clear difference between bodily rights that are pre-political and property rights that must be seen as positive, the result of regulation by the body politic.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn23-1470594X12447784">
<label>23.</label>
<p>For instance, see Pogge’s many criticisms of Rawls for failing to have individuals as parties to the global original position. Compare Pogge (2003–04: 1745).</p>

<p>To be sure, we are likely to call on those societies that secure their members’ rights and duties to assist those burdened societies who fail to do so. But such a Rawlsian ‘duty of assistance’, being a distinctly positive one, is clearly not what Pogge wants to achieve. For this point, in the context of Pogge’s debate with Rawls, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470594X12447784">Nili (2010</xref>: 289–90).</p>

<p>I take this to be Rousseau’s view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470594X12447784">Nili, 2011a</xref>). The equation of jurisdiction with ownership might seem problematic to those who believe, like Allen Buchanan for example, that we must distinguish ‘between the people’s relationship to public land (a relationship of property ownership) and their relationship to the whole territory of the state (which includes private as well as public land)’. But original public ownership is perfectly compatible with the liberal belief, also noted by Buchanan, that ‘any just society will have a prominent place for private property’, as a necessary outcome of the commitment of the body politic to respect and promote individual autonomy. I do not develop this point further since I take Pogge’s view here to be essentially the same. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470594X12447784">Buchanan (2003</xref>: 233–4).</p>

<p>This point is emphasized by Leif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1470594X12447784">Wenar (2006</xref>: 108). While the rigorist position shares much with Wenar’s view of international affairs, Wenar explicitly rejects the idea of democracy as a standard of legitimacy, and also focuses on problems in Pogge that I find less essential, such as the impossibility of withdrawal from an institutional order (which I argue may apply to individuals, but not necessarily to states). See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1470594X12447784">Wenar (2010</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470594X12447784">Nili (2011b</xref>).</p>

<p>The ongoing debate regarding the need for overarching institutions in such cases has to do solely with the enforcement bodies needed to prevent or correct harms, not with identifying certain acts as harms. Compare Allen Buchanan and Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X12447784">Keohane (2004)</xref>. Existing enforcement bodies such as NATO, in turn, can clearly be seen as a web of bilateral contracts multiplied through formal institutions simply for the sake of efficiency (reducing transaction costs, for example), which is a point in many ways granted even by the most ardent believers in the force of international institutions. See Robert Keohane and Lisa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470594X12447784">Martin (1995)</xref>. Note also that the fact that international organizations generate their own dynamics and derivative organizations that exceed national borders does not really show otherwise. For this claim, see Joshua Cohen and Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X12447784">Sabel (2006)</xref>. It is contrasted by realists who insist (rather plausibly) that international organizations depend on powerful states and have no meaningful existence independently of the balance of power.

<p>As Jiwei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X12447784">Ci (2010</xref>: 88–9) notes, Pogge is not explicit on whether the main institutional division is economic or political, and this quote also brings out a part of the tension between these dimensions. If the main division is economic and if eradicating poverty is the top priority, then it is clear that cooperation with ‘distributive dictatorships’ such as the Saudi one should continue, regardless of the fact that the ‘Saudi clan’ lacks the democracy which Pogge himself asserts as a standard of legitimacy. If, alternatively, the main division is political, then the fact that Saudi Arabia is very likely to become poor following a boycott still should not allow the royal family to maintain its trading privileges. Since my focus here is more conceptual, I do not pursue this problem further.</p>

<p>The common sense of even a ‘child of eight years old’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470594X12447784">Kant (1996d</xref>) insists, shows that stealing the deposit of a deceased man is wrong even when one is in dire need and the deceased’s heirs are ‘rich, uncharitable, thoroughly extravagant and luxurious’. Will that not be even truer of the case at hand? When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470594X12447784">Kant (1997</xref>: 5:37) says that the violation of duty in such cases makes a man ‘worthless although he has filled his purse’, is this really just excessive attention to one’s own moral worth?</p>

<p>In emphasizing this need to find common ground with statist views, my approach has certain affinities with what Lea Ypi calls ‘statist cosmopolitanism’.

See Lea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1470594X12447784">Ypi (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1470594X12447784">2010</xref>).

<p>Kant explicitly considers duties of beneficence both in the <italic>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals</italic> (1996c) and in <italic>The Metaphysics of Morals</italic> (1996a). But aside from the fact that Kant’s argument is famously susceptible to consequentialist responses (in particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470594X12447784">Kant, 1996c</xref>: 423), there is the further difference that these positive duties are postulated here as capable of <italic>trumping</italic> our negative duties – hence the special need to delineate these positive duties in the most concrete way possible. Thus, my account can justify the USA and the UK cooperating with Stalin against Hitler, while pure Kantian deontology would presumably not recognize any such ‘supreme emergency’. The notion of ‘supreme emergency’ can be found in Michael Walzer’s <italic>Just and Unjust Wars</italic> (2000), which explicitly treats World War II as the ‘paradigmatic case’ of a just war. For other Kantian perspectives on the themes discussed here, see Shelly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470594X12447784">Kagan (1998</xref>: Section 3.2) on the distinction between ‘moderate’ and ‘absolutist’ deontology and see also Christine M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470594X12447784">Korsgaard (1986</xref>) and Onora <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470594X12447784">O’Neill (1980</xref>: 285–94).</p>

<p>This responsibility can be satisfied by powerful democratic states through political decisions, even when it is impractical to think it can be entirely satisfied by individual democratic citizens as consumers. I could be using a laptop full of tainted minerals to type this very essay, and you could be using one to read it. But the solution cannot be complete or realistic if we only boycott the relevant manufacturer as individuals, laudable as this may be (though perhaps not even obligatory insofar as we are bona fide purchasers). That is why the individual actions of each consumer are not my focus here: the main attention should not be on a personal decision by each consumer to stay away from all computers, but on a <italic>political</italic> decision by each democracy to stay away from dictatorships.</p>
