<p>63.4171 ALDRICH, Daniel P. — <bold>A normal accident or a sea-change? Nuclear host communities respond to the 3/11 [2011 Fukushima] disaster</bold>. <italic>Japanese Journal of Political Science</italic> 14(2), June 2013: 261–276.</p>
<p>While 3/11 [2011 Fukushima] has altered energy policies around the world, insufficient attention has focused on reactions from local nuclear power plant host communities and their neighbors throughout Japan. Using site visits to such towns, interviews with relevant actors, and secondary and tertiary literature, this article investigates the community crisis-management strategies of two types of cities, towns, and villages: those which have nuclear plants directly in their backyards and neighboring cities further away (within a 30 mile radius). Responses to the disaster have varied with distance to nuclear facilities but in a way contrary to the standard theories based on the concept of the “distance decay function”. Using qualitative data, this article underscores how national energy and crisis-response policies rest strongly on the political economy, experiences of, and decisions made at the subnational level.

<p>What courses of action would allow a talented legislator in the current Brazilian institutional arrangement, having intense preferences in any area of foreign policy, to identify avenues for increasing participation in decision-making in that area? This article centers on decision-making regarding Brazilian foreign policy, dividing it analytically in two stages: (1) an <italic>ex ante</italic> examination of foreign policy matters by the legislature, that is, before bills are formally presented for legislative deliberation; (2) <italic>ex post</italic> at the beginning of the formal assessment of these propositions by the legislature. It is based on William Riker's concept of heresthetics, taken as the ability to structure the world in order to win the game, transforming an unfavorable situation to achieve goals. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Some critics allege that the housing bubble and ensuing financial crisis were consequences of misguided state intervention, while others contend that the sources of the crisis lay in the pathologies of unregulated markets. Both sides, however, treat the crisis and its underlying causes primarily through an economic lens of cost-benefit analysis. Building on the insights of contemporary political theorists and the new institutionalism in political science, we consider American housing policy from the vantage of virtue theory. Not only is housing and mortgage policy inevitably normative, but public policy can be an important tool in fostering what we call the “subprime virtues” of truth-telling, promise-keeping, frugality, moderation, commitment, foresight, and judgment that are absolute prerequisites for any decent society.

<p>One of the most prominent explanations of the creation and maintenance of independent judiciary is the “insurance theory” that proposes a positive relationship between political competition and judicial independence. But, does intense political competition inevitably lead to higher levels of judicial independence across all types of democracies? Conducting a large-<italic>N</italic> cross-country analysis over 97 democratic countries, this study shows that as democratic quality across countries changes, the impact of political competition on judicial independence changes as well. The empirical findings reveal that while in advanced democracies high levels of political competition enhances judicial independence, in developing democracies political competition significantly hampers the independence of the courts.

<p>63.4175 BERTELLI, Anthony M.; LEWIS, David E. — <bold>Policy influence, agency-specific expertise, and exit in the [US] federal service</bold>. <italic>Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory</italic> 23(2), Apr. 2013: 223–245.</p>
<p>Executive turnover influences agency performance, policy implementation, and ultimately the success of legislative delegations. We argue that turnover intention is a function of labor market opportunities — specifically, outside employment opportunities and the acquisition of nontransferable, agency-specific human capital — as well as perceptions about the way in which political decisions have affected federal executive influence over policymaking. Statistical evidence for these claims is provided using data from the 2007–2008 [US] Survey on the Future of Government Service. We draw out the implications of these findings for our understanding of federal labor markets, the construction of civil service systems, and the politicization of executive branch agencies.

<p>The Office of the Solicitor General wins the vast majority of Supreme Court cases in which it participates. Does it enjoy a built-in advantage, or does it win because it employs experienced litigators, enjoys resource advantages, or carries the executive's sword? To answer these questions, we employ cutting-edge matching methods. After matching OSG lawyers with nearly identical non-OSG lawyers in nearly identical cases, we find that OSG attorneys still are more likely to win their cases. We discuss possible reasons for this built-in advantage along with some practical implications of our findings. [R]</p>
<p>63.4178 BLACKSTONE, Bethany — <bold>An analysis of policy-based congressional responses to the US Supreme Court's constitutional decisions</bold>. <italic>Law and Society Review</italic> 47(1), March 2013: 199–228.</p>
<p>While Congress can attempt to overrule constitutional decisions of the Supreme Court by initiating the constitutional amendment process, an amendment is rarely a practicable option. Instead, Congress regularly tries to modify the impact of constitutional decisions with ordinary legislation. I analyze policy-based responses to the Supreme Court's constitutional decisions that were initiated in Congress between 1995 and 2010. For each responsive proposal, I consider the relationship between the proposed legislation and the Court's legal holding and the relationship between the proposal and the public policy associated with the Court's decision. I find that Congress enjoys considerable success in reversing the policy impacts of the Court's decisions but is limited in its ability to overcome the Court's legal rules. [R]</p>

<p>This research note describes an update to Democratic Electoral Systems (DES) dataset. We extend the temporal scope of the original dataset by including all legislative and presidential elections that took place in democratic states from 2001 to 2011. In addition to significantly expanding the size of the DES dataset, we offer a simplified classification scheme for electoral systems. We also provide more detailed information about all democratic elections since 1946, including the dates for each round of elections as well as the rules used in different electoral tiers. A brief temporal and geographic overview of the data is presented. [R]</p>

<p>This article addresses the democratically fundamental question of the inclusiveness of electorates and of its impact on citizens’ representation. It investigates comparatively this source of newly disenfranchised citizens in a globalized society with increasing mobility. On the one hand, electoral laws vary in their inclusion or exclusion of emigrants and in the right to vote to non-national residents (immigrants). On the other hand, naturalization laws vary in the maintenance of nationality for nationals abroad (emigrants) and in their inclusion of non-national residents. We illustrate levels of “discrepancy” between electorate and citizenship in 22 OECD countries qualitatively, by presenting differences of electoral and nationality laws, and quantitatively, by comparing the size of citizenship with that of the electorate, and the national and resident populations.

<p>63.4181 CATALANO, Serida Lucrezia — <bold>Islamists and the regime: applying a new framework for analysis to the case of Family Code reforms in Morocco</bold>. <italic>Party Politics</italic> 19(3), May 2013: 408–431.</p>
<p>This paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing the strategic interaction between Islamists — pragmatic and dogmatic — and the regime when Shari'a-based issues are negotiated. I advance the new notion that pragmatists might be responsive to the Islamist electorate. Within the framework, I generate the hypothesis that, if the regime promotes substantive reforms and the Islamist electorate supports them, then the internal cohesiveness of Islamist parties is weakened. In the case of Family Code reforms in Morocco, empirical analysis confirms that Islamists’ change of strategy in 2003 — from opposing to not opposing the reforms — was due to changed preferences within the electorate in favor of reform. This change in preferences was matched by deep divisions within the Islamists and had dramatic repercussions upon the internal cohesiveness of the party. [R]</p>
<p>63.4182 CAVARI, Amnon — <bold>The short-term effect of [US president's] going public</bold>. <italic>Political Research Quarterly</italic> 66(2), June 2013: 336–351.</p>
<p>This paper examines the direct, short-term effect of presidential communications on policy preferences. Using panel studies and post-speech surveys, I demonstrate that following a speech, public opinion changes in the direction of the president. This effect is strongest among people who watch the president. While the number of people who tune to the president may be small, indeed getting smaller over time, it is composed of people who participate in the political process, are more likely to affect it, and therefore are of interest to opinion leaders. The findings reveal that presidents are effective leaders of public opinion. [R]</p>
<p>63.4183 COAKLEY, John — <bold>The prehistory of the Irish presidency</bold>. <italic>Irish Political Studies</italic> 27(4), Dec. 2012: 539–558.</p>
<p>This article traces the significance of offices which preceded that of President of Ireland and of models on which the President of Ireland was based, notably the British monarchy, for the post-1937 presidency. The relatively powerless role of the Irish President — a political anomaly, as the office-holder is directly elected — is attributable to an important historical legacy. A key component in this is the set of attitudes towards Great Britain and its monarch that has formed a central part of Irish nationalist ideology, and that has sought to marginalize or eliminate the British presence in Ireland, as symbolized by the monarch and his or her representative in Dublin. This created a distribution of power strongly tilted in the direction first of the President of the Executive Council (1922–1937) and then of the Taoiseach.

<p>This article examines the relative importance to Britons of a range of potential identities. It shows that the public's concerns about descriptive representation operate at the collective level, not the individual, but this does not stop them wanting to see a more diverse parliament, across a range of different characteristics. However, the representational characteristics that matter most to the public are not the same ones that much of the academic literature has focused on. Although there is some self-identification, this desire was especially strong within certain groups — most notably among the Muslim, Asian, Black and gay and lesbian respondents. Views on the desirability of increased or decreased representation appear, to some extent, to be based on a lack of knowledge: the study revealed large-scale ignorance about the composition of the British House of Commons.

<p>63.4185 CRESPIN, Michael H.; ROHDE, David W.; VANDER WIELEN, Ryan J. — <bold>Measuring variations in [US] party unity voting: [in the House of Representatives] an assessment of agenda effects [1953–2004]</bold>. <italic>Party Politics</italic> 19(3), May 2013: 432–457.</p>
<p>Conventional measures of party divisiveness, such as the percentage of party votes in a particular Congress, fail to consider important changes in the agenda from one Congress to the next. We introduce a measure that controls for such changes, drawing attention to the effect that agenda change has on observed party divisiveness and providing a more accurate account of party divisiveness across time. We analyze party voting in the US House of Representatives between 1953 and 2004, and find that a sizeable amount of the fluctuation in party divisiveness identified by conventional measures is mitigated using this method. While we examine party voting in the US House, our theory and method is applicable to similar measures used in the study of other legislatures (e.g., Rice and Attinà indices). [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4186 CURINI, Luigi; PINTO, Luca — <bold>Government formation under the shadow of a core party: the case of the First Italian Republic [1946–1993]</bold>. <italic>Party Politics</italic> 19(3), May 2013: 502–522.</p>
<p>Despite its theoretical relevance, the role played by the existence of a core party in explaining the partisan composition of governments represents an understudied area in the empirical research on coalition formations. This article addresses the gap in the literature by focusing on the Italian case between 1946–1993. The role of the core party not only finds corroboration in the data, but it also clarifies the role played by political inertia. In this sense, the nature of the cabinet-bargaining process appears to be qualitatively different when a core party is present. Beyond better accounting for the patterns of government formation, our results help to identify the necessary (spatial) conditions under which the cycle of a government formula can be expected to be broken.

<p>The events which have unfolded since 2011 in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Syria have brought back to the fore the role of the military in Arab countries, more precisely in situations of political transition or revolutionary rupture. These two processes underline the variety of relationships between the military and the political leaders, with, as concerns the nature of civil-military relations, huge differences from one country to another. Throughout history, the militaries played quite a substantial role in regime change processes (in most cases they were associated to the establishment of authoritarian regimes). They can also play an active or passive role in democratization processes. This paper, based on the available theoretical literature, aims at reassessing the role and place of the militaries in political processes in the context of the ongoing deep transformation of the Arab world.

<p>63.4188 DALY, Erin — <bold>Constitutional protection for environmental rights: the benefits of environmental process</bold>. <italic>International Journal of Peace Studies</italic> 17(2), Winter 2012: 71–80.</p>
<p>More and more constitutions around the world — from Bangladesh to Bolivia, and from the Philippines to the countries of the EU — are explicitly protecting environmental rights and the values of a clean and healthy environment. In many instances, environmental rights are recognized not as substantive entitlements, but as procedural rights. Examples of procedural rights include imposing on governments the obligation to consult with communities before they take actions that will affect their environment or giving individuals the right to participate in governmental processes that will affect their environment. While procedural rights do not guarantee a particular outcome, they may be more effective in preventing environmental degradation. This paper assesses the efficacy of these procedural constitutional environmental protections and whether procedural rights can be more efficacious than substantive environmental rights.

<p>63.4189 DATZ, Giselle; DANCSI, Katalin — <bold>The politics of pension reform reversal: a comparative analysis of Hungary and Argentina</bold>. <italic>East European Politics</italic> 29(1), March 2013: 83–100.</p>
<p>Argentina and Hungary have recently reversed the pension reforms of the 1990s that had instituted a mandatory private pillar and transferred savings under management by private pension funds back to the public sector. We argue that these latest reforms were a product of political dynamics that allowed the governments of C. Kirchner in Argentina and V. Orban in Hungary to enjoy legislative support and no significant popular backlash as the incumbents blamed the capitalization system for failures in coverage, poor performance, and high administrative costs. Yet institutional considerations alone do not explain the type of pension reform enacted nor its timing. The need felt to finance short-term debt obligations and promote deficit-reduction in a context of significantly restricted access to international credit was crucial in both countries.

<p>We analyze the Westminster system, an example of stability and social consensuality about fundamental values. However, some weaknesses have been identified: [e.g.], a two-party system of government, devoid of liveliness in a political process with latent agreement of different generations, and, in essence, the same or cosmetically changed political establishment. Consistence of government of one or another party is caused by the electoral system, whose main characteristics are the surplus of inequity and deficit of modernity. We label the recent elections in Great Britain as a precedent, especially because of the new type of government — the coalition cabinet — and also consider the Liberal-Democrats. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4191 ELGIE, Robert — <bold>The President of Ireland in comparative perspective</bold>. <italic>Irish Political Studies</italic> 27(4), Dec. 2012: 502–521.</p>
<p>This article compares the Irish presidency with other presidencies. It examines the spread of direct presidential elections and the gradual diffusion of constitutions with a mix of presidential and parliamentary features. It then compares the Irish President with 42 other presidencies, including countries with a directly elected president and those with an indirectly elected president. It compares the powers of these presidents, the process of election, and the prospects for constitutional reform. The comparison shows that Ireland is now one of a small group of countries that have a directly elected but weak presidency, and that while the Irish presidency may be unusual in almost all aspects of the electoral process, the Irish case has equivalents elsewhere. The main conclusion is that the Irish presidency is not unique.

<p>At first, few constitutional experts took seriously the argument that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act exceeded Congress's power under the commerce clause. So it came as no surprise when the five Republican-appointed justices opined the Act did indeed exceed Congress's commerce clause power. But it came as a great surprise when Chief Justice J. Roberts, joined by the four Democrat-appointed justices, ruled that the Act could be sustained as an exercise of Congress's taxing power — a ground urged by the government almost as an afterthought. This essay ponders and tries to unravel some of these puzzles. [R, abr.] [First of a series of articles on “The Supreme Court's PPACA [US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act] decision”.

<p>The formal constitutional powers of the President of Ireland define the framework within which the office-holder can act, but they tell only part of the story. The President's main powers are the right to refer bills to the Supreme Court for a decision on their constitutionality and, in certain circumstances, to refuse a prime ministerial request for a dissolution of parliament. Within the parameters of the constitution presidents might choose either a maximalist or a minimalist interpretation of the role, and in practice the latter has prevailed, perhaps due in some measure to path dependency. It is difficult to argue that any aspects of government policy would have been different had any presidential election produced a different outcome, though on occasions presidents have wielded “soft power,” [with] political repercussions.

<p>The election of two energetic women in succession as President of Ireland challenged the notion that the presidency was a long-service reward for retiring politicians. M. Robinson and M. McAleese broke the male domination of the office, interpreted its functions in a more dynamic manner, and utilized the “soft power” of the presidency with skill. Yet, as individuals they were very different in political focus, experience and ideological disposition. This article charts their respective backgrounds and discusses the context in which each woman came to the presidency. It explores their vision for the office. Focusing on the potential for harnessing the soft power of the presidency, it argues that Robinson adopted a classical representative view of the office, whereas McAleese chose a facilitatory style of leadership.

Potentialities and prospects of the energy issue between the BRICs)</bold>. <italic>Contexto internacional</italic> 34(2), July-Dec. 2012: 531–572.</p>
<p>The article analyzes energy-related issues among the BRICs and the potential refashioning of the world energy order that might spring from them. It begins by investigating the growing impact of the BRICs in the international order, so as to tracking their progress in a field so far restricted to developed countries and their oil suppliers. It then analyzes the energy matrix of each of the five BRICs from the point of view of political economy and sustainability. The final section maps the tensions and complementarities between the BRICs and outlines the possibilities and limits of their cooperation on energy issues. Given the potential for energy-related cooperation between these countries, a clear definition of their national energy supply and demand may allow the group to position itself as a new pole in the world energy market.

<p>This article shows how the binary opposition between the cultural rights of indigenous populations and constitutionally protected universal rights leads to a closure of the discourse about these concepts. The inability to dislodge the binary is particularly damaging in post-colonial societies where the misrecognition of cultural practices may have negative implications for women, because of its impact on the redistribution of resources. By applying N. Fraser's concept of recognition and redistribution to the debate on customary law and land in South Africa, I first show the complexity of gender relations in “multicultural” contexts in post-colonial societies, and second, [seek] ways of dealing with the conflict between culture and rights in a more productive way.

<p>Social theory almost invariably equates modernity with the sovereign state. This equation must be nuanced because the modern era and modern strategies of international stability have contained non-sovereign units. Throughout the 19th c. the Great Powers alternated between creating non-sovereign units and creating sovereign units as instruments in these stabilizing strategies. The degree of trust between the Great Powers accounts for the shift between the two strategies: they tended to create non-sovereign units when mutual trust was high and sovereign ones when trust was low. This article analyzes Great Power strategies of designing forms of rule in the Balkans between 1820 and 1878. As in previous centuries, 19th c. Europe actually consisted of two parallel but connected systems: the egalitarian system of sovereign states and a system of non-sovereign entities. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article considers to what extent the <italic>National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</italic> decision is also about health care law, properly conceived. Under one view, health care law is the subdiscipline that inquires how courts and government actors take account of the special features of medicine that make legal or policy issues especially problematic — rather than regarding health care delivery and finance more generically, like most any other economic or social enterprise. Viewed this way, the opinions from the [US Supreme] Court's conservative justices are mainly about general constitutional law principles. In contrast, Justice R. Bader Ginsburg's dissenting opinion for the four more liberal justices is just as much about health care law as it is about constitutional law. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4192]</p>

<p>Political polarization is changing power relationships between [the US] Congress and the Supreme Court, in some ways which are evident, such as through a more ideological Supreme Court confirmation process, and in some ways that have been mostly hidden, such as through the dramatic decline in congressional overrides of Supreme Court statutory interpretation case law. As Congress becomes ever more partisan and its moderates are forced out or retire, and as Supreme Court Justices become associated increasingly with the views of the president and party which appointed them, the Congress-Supreme Court relationship is likely to change further.

<p>This analysis seeks to understand the decline of Supreme Court consensual norms often attributed to the failed leadership of Chief Justice Stone. A new unit of analysis — justice-level dissent and concurrence rates — supports an alternative view of observed increases in dissensual decision-making. When these measures are estimated with time-series techniques, results offer evidence of multiple change-points in this norm of the Court that both lead and lag Stone's elevation. Broader contextual explanations related to the alteration of the Court's discretionary issue agenda and its ideological and demographic composition also contribute to fractures in the once-unanimous voting coalitions.

<p>In 2007, the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales held reviews of their moratoriums on the commercial release of genetically modified (GM) food crops. The public inquiry form of review selected offered the best strategic pathway to amend these moratoriums to allow commercial release. As such, the reviews represented “political technologies”. This proposition is informed by: their formation within a policy context of pro-GM development, which saw “stacked” pro-GM review panels, narrow terms of reference, and outcomes favoring a narrow coalition of agbiotechnology interests; the critical literature on public inquiries; and other evidences that suggest the underlying purpose of the public inquiries was to reach the inescapable conclusion that the moratoriums should be changed.

<p>This study traces the transnational interactions that contributed to introducing the low-carbon economy agenda into Chinese policy-making. A microprocessual two-level analysis (outside-in as well as inside-access) is employed to analyze transnational and domestic exchanges. The study provides evidence that low-carbon agenda-setting — introduced by transnational actors, backed by foreign funding, promoted by policy entrepreneurs from domestic research institutes, propelled by top-level attention, but only gradually and cautiously adopted by the government bureaucracy — can be considered a case of effective transnational diffusion based on converging perceptions of novel policy challenges and options. Opinion leaders and policy-brokers from the government-linked scientific community functioned as effective access points to the Chinese government's policy agenda. [R]</p>

<p>Almost without exception, law professors dismissed the possibility that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) might be unconstitutional — but something went wrong on the way to the courthouse. What explains the epic failure of law professors to accurately predict how Article 3 judges would approach the case? This essay identifies three distinct but complementary factors that might help explain the observed failure. (1) They engaged in motivated reasoning, based on their pre-existing political and policy preferences. (2) Their psychology led them to massively overstate the probability of success and suppress any misgivings or cautious hedging. (3) Once it became clear that the PPACA was in serious jeopardy, they decided to pursue politics by other means, and organized the academic equivalent of a vigilance committee.

<p>This study offers the first time-series cross-section analysis of state courts in Mexico, explaining variation in judicial spending across Mexico's 31 states from 1993 to 2009. Cutting against mainstream accounts of judicial empowerment that highlight electoral competition, I conclude that increasing competition, while a necessary precondition for the emergence of new political actors, has mixed results after a minimum, threshold level. Ideological motivations, especially on the left, enhance court budgets, and these motivations surmount the dampening, Downsian effect of competition. Further, the reduced effect of the PAN (National Action Party, former opposition party) and the increased positive effect of the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party, former national hegemon) since 2000, suggest ways in which former opposition parties can become less ideological (or more pro-regime), whereas former dominant parties can become more ideological (or more anti-regime).

<p>This article examines the crisis-management capabilities of Japan's Self Defense Forces (SDF) in the areas of UN peacekeeping, counter-terrorism, and disaster relief. The three types of overseas operations were all initiated by Japan as a response to international crises. Regarding counter-terrorism, Japan's crisis-management capabilities were enhanced by the passing of a novel Anti-Terrorism Law in October 2001 after the 9/11 [2001] attacks. SDF crisis-management capabilities in disaster relief are the least controversial, due to the SDF's political neutrality and their humanitarian and non-military activities. This article highlights and compares the strengths and weaknesses of Japan's capabilities in the three types of SDF overseas operations. It demonstrates that a number of problem areas remain, including the need for legal amendment as well as the enhancement of public support and political consensus.

<p>After the Korean War (1950–1953), the two militarized Koreas governed each member of society in similar ways through their disciplinary politics of antagonistic nationalism. The existing studies of state-formation in the two Koreas have neglected an aspect of state power that was neither necessarily top-down nor violent from above but also reproduced from below. In both South and North Korea, especially from the 1960s to the 1970s, state power had internal dynamics that penetrated the day-to-day activities of most citizens and led them to actively accept and participate in nationalist rule. This article explores an understudied aspect of the two Koreas’ state power that was disciplinarily diffused in people's everyday practices through reproduction of aggressive nationalism from below and the organic construction of the individual body and nation.

<p>The standard explanation for increasing party polarization in [the US] Congress is based on factors that would affect all policy issues simultaneously. We show that this has not happened. We examine the dimensionality of legislative choice in the House of Representatives, scaling eighteen issues in each Congress from 1965 through 2004. We detect considerable variability in issue dimensionality, an evolution in the structure of choice over time, and changes in the relationship between party unity and issue dimensionality. Our findings suggest that polarization has occurred on an issue-by-issue basis, reinvigorating the debate over the role of policy substance in shaping congressional politics. [R]</p>

<p>This study examines the descriptive representation of younger-age cohorts in Asian parliaments.

Analyzing an original dataset of over four thousand MPs from 14 countries, I find support for the argument that PR electoral systems favor the election of younger MPs even after controlling for multiple alternative explanations.

<p>Despite a relatively healthy financial sector, the Japanese economy contracted 6.3% in 2009 during the global financial crisis (GFC), the starkest drop among the OECD countries. Since then, the Japanese economy has been slow to recover, although the Japanese government has implemented multiple economic stimulus packages with a high aggregate value. By tracing the Japanese government's response to the GFC in the critical months of October 2008 through the end of 2009, this study argues that the Japanese government failed to manage the crisis decisively due to institutional constraints derived, ironically, from the experiences that Japan gained from a series of financial crises in the 1990s and 2000s. Financial crisis-fatigue constrained the supply of Japan's fiscal and monetary measures against the GFC and slowed political response, [and] made Japanese society unresponsive to these measures.

<p>Leaders are influential in Turkish politics; each leader assumed office with different personal and political backgrounds, worldviews, and personality characteristics. Nonetheless, a systematic study of political leaders in Turkish politics and foreign policy has rarely been a concern to scholars of Turkey. This lack of attention to Turkey's political leaders affects not only a nuanced understanding of its domestic politics but also its foreign policy. How do Turkish leaders’ idiosyncratic traits affect their politics? How does the common phrase “secular and religious leaders” capture differences among Turkey's leadership? Utilizing a method of leadership assessment at-a-distance, this piece [addresses] such questions with respect to foreign policy profiles of all post-Cold War prime ministers of Turkey. It illustrates that Turkish leaders have distinct leadership traits but cannot be reduced to “seculars” and “Islamists”. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4309]</p>

<p>We offer the first large-scale, multiple-source analysis of the outcome of what may be the most extensive effort to selectively censor human expression ever implemented. We have devised a system to locate, download, and analyze the content of millions of social media posts originating from nearly 1,400 different social media services all over China before the Chinese government is able to find, evaluate, and censor (i.e., remove from the internet) the subset they deem objectionable. Using modern computer-assisted text-analytic methods that we adapt to and validate in the Chinese language, we compare the substantive content of posts censored to those not censored over time in each of 85 topic areas. We show that the censorship program is aimed at curtailing collective action by silencing comments that represent, reinforce, or spur social mobilization, regardless of content. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Did the DPJ engage in crisis-response and management differently [from] the LDP? If so, why? If not, why not?

<p>(LDP) and 2009 (DPJ), Senkaku Islands under the LDP (2008) and DPJ (2010), and the Hanshin quake in 1995 (LDP) and Fukushima in 2011 (DPJ). Comparing the two parties’ responses, I find that both parties had similar problems with information-management, but that there were characteristic and predictable trade-offs of their different party decision-making structures and relations with the national bureaucracy. Finally, I mention some inherent structural problems of Japanese politics and policy-making.

<p>When collective choices are made in more than one round and with different groups of decision-makers, so-called “election inversions” may take place, where each round produces different majority outcomes. In this article, two versions of such compound majority paradoxes are identified that are particularly, but not exclusively, relevant for systems of proportional representation with governing coalitions: the “Threshold Paradox” and the “Federal Paradox”. The empirical relevance of the paradoxes is illustrated with examples from two Danish elections (in 1971 and in 1990), where a majority of the voters voted for one bloc of parties, but a majority of the seats fell to another.

<p>This article looks at the long struggle to reform the Dutch disability insurance fund, which covered close to 10% of the labor force in 2002. Ideas played a strategic role in the framing and discourse of the policy reforms. A template propagated by the European Commission was used by center-left reform advocates to soften a neoliberal campaign to overhaul the disability insurance scheme. Center-left politicians used European deliberations to convince their colleagues to accept increased spending on activation programs rather than rely on rounds of cutbacks. Labor market activation also resonated with voters, for very different reasons. By the time that the disability law was repealed in 2006, many voters had altered their minds about the disability fund, resenting the fact that “problematic” minorities lived off welfare state benefits.

<p>Policy-makers may take a number of measures to keep their preferred policies intact in the face of political threats. I contend that the general and coherent implications of delegation and insulation theories can be realized by focusing on the politics of particular issue areas and by reconsidering a recent formalization of T. M. Moe's theory of policy insulation. I examine this argument empirically using augmented versions of prominent data-sets on statutory delegation and agency design in the US. The analysis yields results consistent with the proposition that issue-specific political uncertainty leads to policy insulation. The explanatory power of measures of issue-specific policy volatility and conflict (proxies for political uncertainty) rivals that of the interbranch conflict measures that existing research tends to emphasize.

With regard to selected cases of implementation of states of emergency in the history of the US, it becomes clear that specific patterns of justification recur over time. They can — with Foucault — be considered as a dispositive of democratic government. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We engage in a systematic exploration of the link between ethnic identity and preferences for public policies through a series of individual and aggregated analyses of Afrobarometer survey data from 18 sub-Saharan African countries. We find that in most countries, preferences do vary based on ethnic group membership. This variation is not merely an expression of individual-level socioeconomic differences or of group-level cultural differences. Instead, we suggest that citizens use ethnicity as a group heuristic for evaluating public policies in a few predictable ways: We find more persistent disagreement about public policies between politically relevant ethnic groups and where group disparities in wealth are high.

<p>“A property-owning democracy” has been at the center of Conservative Party social policy since N. Skelton coined the phrase in 1924. The idea has been underpinned by contrasting the independent, hygienic, suburban homeowner with the urban, managed, flat-dwelling, high-density council tenant. No Conservative-led government has left office with a homeownership rate lower than when it came to power and the right to buy has enabled this growth to be maintained. However, in 2005, homeownership started to decline and this drop has continued into the Coalition government's term of office with more households now exiting owner-occupation into the private landlord sector than entering owner-occupation from private renting.

<p>The welfare reforms of the [UK] Coalition government [2010—] are marked by the legacy of Thatcherism. Social security reforms in the 1980s reshaped the system towards reliance on means-tested benefits. Negative policy feedback created by the opacity and perverse effects of means-testing has made these benefits an easy target for the Coalition, at least so far as working-age people are concerned. Different policy feedbacks affect policy towards old-age pensions. The government is locked into promoting private pensions, and is extending this commitment with automatic enrolment. To make private pensions pay, it has to reverse the slide to means-testing. The implication is that the pronounced bias against the working poor and in favor of older people in Coalition policy is not simply a matter of electoral preferences: it reflects the political effects of previous policy decisions.

Except in its narrow result upholding the mandate, the chief justice's opinion is heedless of long-standing precedent, aggressive in creating novel grounds for judicial second-guessing of legislative judgments, cavalier with factual assertions, and disrespectful of the position of other governmental institutions.

<p>One of the most significant changes in American law was the application of the Bill of Rights to the states.

Evolutionary psychology posits that birth order can explain support for radical change; older siblings identify with authority and resist changes in the rules, while later-borns defy authority and are willing to alter the status quo. Applying the birth-order hypothesis to the Court, the author finds that the incorporation revolution was led by later-borns, even after taking account of justices’ political preferences. [R]</p>

<p>E. de Valera's 1937 constitution created the office of President.

The age-profile of the three presidents examined and their collective time in office initially appear to confirm such observations. However, they should not be considered as passive. Their willingness to exercise their discretionary powers was an important part of ensuring that the office functioned properly and effectively. It was also during these early years that the protocols and procedures of the office were decided. Though less remarkable than the later, more active presidents, the first three office-holders played an important role in ensuring the smooth emergence of the presidency.

<p>19th c. constitutional reformers focused on parliament. Their central idea was citizenship, modeled variously on the democracy of ancient Athens, small communities like Switzerland, and especially the US, a particular inspiration for Gladstone who admired its constitution. The 1911 Parliament Act marked the final triumph of the Victorian Liberals legacy, with a very different impetus coming from Lloyd George during his coalition. Labour focused on class, not the constitution. After 1945, Labour did not prioritize constitutional reform until the dramatic changes that came after 1997. G. Brown then revived the notion of citizenship, and possible codification, in pursuing the values of Britishness. Labour's legacy was a confusing one. But E. Miliband's policy revision could reclaim the idea of citizenship, an egalitarian concept to counter the inequalities of class. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4096]</p>

<p>Assigning responsibility for political outcomes is complex in political systems where power is apportioned across local, regional and national levels of government.

I develop a set of hypotheses about public attribution of responsibility within a policy sector characterized by multiple tiers of government involvement. The hypotheses are tested using a novel dataset based on a content-coding of responsibility attribution in more than 2000 newspaper articles about health care issues in Denmark. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This study examines varying levels of Europeanization of regulation across policy areas in the same national setting, drawing on the case of Turkey. It analyzes institutional adaptation at both <italic>de jure</italic> and <italic>de facto</italic> levels regarding regulatory institutions and practices, focusing on two distinct policy areas: competition and telecommunications in Turkey. Suggesting that the interactions between the forms of conditionality at the EU level and the institutional capacity at the agency level will shape outcomes, it argues that higher levels of Europeanization will be achieved when firm conditionality meets with strong institutional capacity. The study explores both the process of Europeanization beyond Europe and its limits when it is obstructed by domestic politics, interests and institutions. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>I explore MP'S private bills and other initiatives in the Finnish Parliament. During three electoral periods (1999–2010), the Finnish MPs filed nearly 20,000 proposals: over 75% are budget amendments while law bills constitute some 10%. Very few proposals get processed in committees and even fewer get accepted. Roughly half of the proposals are sponsored by a single MP while the rest are sponsored by various combinations of MPs. While analyses of plenary voting primarily divide the Finnish MPs into government and opposition blocs, the analysis of private MPs proposals results in completely different pattern of MP cooperation. Comparing the sponsor networks to the Swedish parliament, where the MPs tend to cooperate within the same Political Party Groups, reveals that the Finnish MPs cooperate significantly more over the party lines.

<p>We demonstrate that [US] Senators use office allowances to create positive constituent service and policy-expert impressions among voters, but the effects depend on the representational expectations of constituents and the nature of dual representation. Whether a Senator shares the same party and represents a densely populated state in part determines the effectiveness of constituent service activities and efforts to establish policy expertise. The representational challenge faced by Senators is more complicated than those faced by House members and more nuanced than the existing literature suggests. We conclude by examining the different challenges Senators and representatives face in building representational relationships. [R]</p>

<p>This article examines the presidencies of E. Childers, C. Ó Dálaigh and P. Hillery during the period 1973–1990. Each is examined in terms of the background of the incumbent, the circumstances of his nomination as president and his role in office. [Under] Childers, the role assumed a higher public profile, with national engagements and international travel, a defining feature of all subsequent presidencies. Nonetheless, each of the presidents covered adopted a narrow interpretation of the role, sought to avoid conflict with the government of the day and was strongly guided by governmental definition of the role and its powers. Moreover, during the term of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition led by L. Cosgrave (1973–1977), evidence was found of uncomfortable cohabitation between presidents and an administration from different political traditions.

Through survey data in all three countries, empirical evidence is largely consistent with the “best of both worlds” thesis with behavior and preferences varying by seat type. [R]</p>

<p>Although scholars have established that oral arguments play a role in Supreme Court decision-making, a fundamental question remains: can oral arguments change justices’ votes? Using data on the positions taken by Justices Blackmun and Powell prior to oral arguments, the authors answer this question while implicitly addressing another: how effectively can attorneys persuade the Court during arguments dominated by justices attempting to persuade each other? The authors find that in a significant minority of cases, justices are persuaded to switch their vote as a result of oral argument and that high-quality attorneys play a central role in that persuasion.

<p>A great deal of the US Supreme Court's federalism jurisprudence over the past two decades has focused on the outer limits of federal power, suggesting a mutually exclusive division of jurisdiction between the states and the federal government, where subjects are regulated by one sovereign or the other but not both. This is not an accurate picture of American governance as it has operated over the past half century — most important areas of American life are regulated concurrently by both the federal government and the states. The Supreme Court's June 2012 decision clearing the way for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) thus should not be regarded as an affront to state sovereignty but as a realistic embrace of state power in its active, modern form.

<p>Although there is a substantial literature examining public confidence in the judiciary in developed nations, scholars have paid scant attention to analyzing judicial confidence in developing countries. Building on extant work regarding developed nations and introducing original hypotheses in the context of developing nations, this research explains influences on public confidence in Latin American judiciaries by developing a theory that focuses on the potential influences of institutional quality, experiences, and individual attitudes. The hypotheses are empirically tested with the rich individual-level data compiled by the Latin American Public Opinion Project 2006 survey. The results indicate that a variety of factors influence public confidence in Latin American courts; the role of context explains points of consistency and divergence with research on developed nations.

<p>Coalition governments are the norm across Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). This paper uses two models to identify key actors in government-formation in CEE: the dominant and central players model; and the portfolio allocation model. The results show that each of these models contributes significantly to our understanding of which parties are key actors in CEE. The key actors identified by each model are overwhelmingly likely to become members of the cabinet and provide the Prime Minister of the government. Key players are also more likely to accrue a greater share of portfolio payoffs from the coalition bargaining process as well as acquiring the most salient portfolios. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The internationalization of the state in Brazil has often been considered an effect of the country's recent rise as an emerging power, even when it could be seen as the cause of its rising projection and leadership.

The results show that the lower levels of internationalization of the Argentine state could easily be interpreted as diminishing the country's international influence in the past twenty years, explaining Brazilian leadership.

<p>Although policy-makers have sought to liberalize network-based utilities, a more detailed look at privatization pathways reveals remarkable sector-specific differences. This article examines why efforts to privatize public utilities have differed so greatly in the telecommunications, postal, and railway sectors. By estimating probit models, it is demonstrated that firm characteristics and sector-specific EU integration account for cross-sectoral differences in privatization. More specifically, governments dispose of the most efficient firms first to maximize revenues from privatization sales with low political costs. Regulations at the European level pushed governments to privatize their national postal providers, while privatization in the telecommunications sector is a global trend. In the railway sector, exceptional clauses and regulations have decelerated privatization. [R]</p>

<p>The 11 March 2011 earthquake and tsunami damaged the nuclear reactors in Fukushima. Prime Minister Naoto Kan took this crisis seriously, and made himself personally involved with damage control, especially during the first week. This study examines the responses to the incident by the prime minister's office. Frustrated by the lack of communication coming from the bureaucracy and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Kan began micromanaging damage control. The upscaling, however, did not contribute to improvement in the accident situation in most cases. On the other hand, upscaling made a significant difference when the TEPCO officials considered withdrawing from the accident. By upscaling to the higher authority, Kan stopped their withdrawal. [Eventually], the political leaders moved down to a closer level to the accident and successfully coordinated the recovery work. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4213]</p>

<p>While the metaphor of House parties as cartels is widely accepted, its application to the Senate is difficult, as the majority party lacks the power to unilaterally manipulate rules and pass legislation. Nevertheless, several scholars have argued that the Senate majority party is able to employ nondebatable motions to table to exclude unwanted amendments with procedural rather than substantive votes. Does the motion to table yield negative agenda control or special party influence? Using an analysis of individual Senators’ behavior on thousands of votes and an assessment of interest group scores, we find that motions to table do not elicit higher party influence or provide much political cover. A desire to speed up the legislative process, rather than to insulate members from electoral scrutiny, seems to motivate the use of motions to table. [R]</p>

<p>How do feminists harmonies cultural rights and gender equality in the governance of the family in multicultural and legally plural societies? Faced with the dilemma that advancing gender justice in the family by advocating uniform laws across religious differences would undermine minority rights in the context of growing Hindu nationalism in the 1990s, the Indian women's movement shifted ideologies and practice and pursued an assemblage of reforms in adjudicative and legislative processes, in the state and society. Women's groups pursued piecemeal legislative reforms in religiously neutral civil and criminal laws that affected the family, and supported by judicial actors, used legal innovation to advance women's rights in adjudication of religious family laws in state courts.

<p>As development and decentralization concepts are closely interlinked to each other, it has become an avowed goal for the governments in the developing countries. Although the process is an important step for democratization in most of the developing countries, often it brings challenges because of some social, political, structural and administrative barriers. To perceive these issues in details, this paper explicates the benefits and challenges of the local government system of a developing country like Bangladesh. Based on the historical and contemporary evidence, the paper explores that despite some successful events, decentralization practices in the country are badly affected by various challenges, which may turn the process into an elusive effort.

<p>This article assesses the EU impact on the asylum policy outcomes in the 27 member states, Norway and Switzerland. It focuses on three central hypotheses about the effects of Europeanization: a race to the bottom, convergence and burden-sharing. Using aggregate and origin-specific asylum data for the period 1999–2010 provided by the UNHCR, we show that the increasing Europeanization of asylum policy has not resulted in a race to the bottom in which asylum recognition rates and the numbers of admitted refugees have eroded. Contrary to existing literature, we find some evidence for convergence of the overall asylum recognition rates but important national differences in the recognition of applicants from the same country of origin persist.

<p>The article studies how political decision-making processes are debated in public in the consensual political system in Finland. IT asks how Finnish political institutions, political culture and media system affect the style and volume of public debate. A case study of the State Productivity Program (2002–2011) shows how the consensus-seeking practices limit publicity. The core decision-makers managed the media in order to avoid publicity during policy negotiations. Elite actors went public mostly in situations where they were unable to achieve their goals through negotiations. The study shows how the coalition partners used the media to maintain distinct political profiles. However, in multi-party governments the ministers can also keep a low public profile when making unpopular decisions. This leaves the Ministry of Finance civil servants a visible role in public.

<p>There are competing theoretical expectations and conflicting empirical results concerning the impact of partisanship on spending on active labor market policies (ALMPs). This paper argues that one should distinguish between different ALMPs. Employment incentives and rehabilitation programs incentivize the unemployed to accept jobs. Direct job-creation reduces the supply of labor by creating non-commercial jobs. Training schemes raise the human capital of the unemployed. Using regression analysis, this paper shows that the positions of political parties towards these three types of ALMPs are different. Party preferences also depend on the welfare regime in which parties are located. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article challenges the common assumption that security policies are the outcome of a security-liberty balance. Drawing on constructivist and cognitive approaches of public policies, it shows through an analysis of the debates on several laws taken by the Israeli Parliament, that these laws must be understood as the reflection and the outcome of a struggle between conflicting “referentials” of political regimes. Deconstructing security policies this way allows us to overcome the static notion of the balance between security and liberty and helps us better grasp the construction process of political regime “referentials” through discourses.

<p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ignited a political firestorm and raised intriguing new questions of constitutional law. Cutting a path between the liberals and conservatives on the US Supreme Court, Chief Justice J. Roberts made small adjustments in established constitutional law to uphold key features of the act. In doing so, he not only upheld the statute but also left the landscape of constitutional law much as he had found it. He did, however, suggest that the federal courts should take a more active role in monitoring how Congress uses its constitutional powers and should not shy away from making specific determinations of whether Congress had abused its power in particular cases.

<p>The study analyzes member states’ correct transposition of the provisions of different EU directives.

Member states’ incentives to deviate, conflict in the Council, as well as characteristics of the adopted EU decisions, such as discretion and complexity, are expected to influence compliance with different EU requirements. Hypotheses are tested on the transposition performance of 15 member states regarding 136 EU provisions. The analyses reveal that member states are likely to act upon their incentives to deviate during the implementation process, and use their freedom of maneuver to achieve compliance with the EU requirements.

It confirms the finding of the literature that women are more likely to drop out of local politics than men and then examines reasons as to why this might be the case and introduces data looking at the future political intentions of councilors after they have stood down. Evidence is found that, having stood down from their council duties, women councilors are less likely to want to remain politically involved than their male colleagues. [R]</p>

<p>The evidence to date suggests that term-limits have indeed changed the character of many of the states’ legislatures, if not always as predicted by their advocates. We report data on veto dynamics over the period 1989–2008 to determine how term-limits have impacted legislative-executive relations. Our data both challenge and support what has become the conventional wisdom, i.e., that term-limits will weaken legislatures relative to their governors. States with more stringent term limits experienced fewer gubernatorial vetoes but proved more likely to override those vetoes when they were issued. Taken together the evidence suggests that the relationship between governors and legislatures in the wake of term-limits is more complex and variable than scholars and others had previously thought.

The deployment of this analytics relocates the focus of inquiry from whether minority religious practices should be accommodated or not, which ones, why and to what extent, to the ways in which this debate constructs the proper subjects of the national belonging, those who legitimately inhabit the national will and body, following a racialized line.

Each set of rituals symbolically express power relationships and divergent national self-understandings of the relationships between religions and parliaments and resolve inherent tensions between the two.

<p>Local government in Italy is invested by an ongoing process of “corporatization” of public services through the creation of private-law companies fully or partially owned by municipalities. This trend represents a shift toward an innovative and unobtrusive <italic>milieu</italic> for policies and politics. Corporatization is consequently intended not merely as a policy instrument, but also as a new opportunity for local politicians to adjust their preferences, to deal with various interests and to build unusual coalitions. Thus, corporatization may influence the concrete working of local political democracy.

It draws on a dataset including 1,335 companies, as well as on qualitative data on six companies. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In Italy, inter-municipal cooperation has taken on a new form, consisting in the shared ownership in joint-stock companies. The “corporatization” of public bodies — the creation of public-owned (or mixed public-private), private-law companies and corporations for the fulfillment of public-interest activities — appears to represent a shift from an institutional intergovernmental structure of cooperation, to one that is pre-eminently played out in the arenas of public-private forms of governance. The article analyzes the literature and overarching trends in inter-municipal cooperation in Italy, and draws on very rich original data on the companies owned by municipalities in six Italian regions to show how these companies represent the locus of inter-municipal (and multi-level) relations that go well beyond the formal boundaries of local administrations, and are often brokered by powerful private partners.

This research uncovers two essential dimensions to legislative behavior: a cross-community dimension that diminished over time in advance of the 2011 election, and a more traditional left-right and nationalist-unionist divide. The study accentuates, however, that unionist and nationalist parties do not vote consistently as cohesive, monolithic blocs. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In the last decades, there has been a spectacular increase in the number of entities providing public services in Spain. Functional decentralization and externalization processes became relevant and they made it possible to modernize the Spanish public sector, which was out of touch with new ideas in the rest of the Europe. We expose the evolution of these processes from 1999 to 2010, through a qualitative analysis using the biplot technique. The results show a trend toward functional decentralization that is more important in the largest cities, especially through the creation of public companies and autonomous organizations. [R]</p>
<p>63.4266 GALE, Fred — <bold>When interests trump institutions: Tasmania's forest policy network and the Bell Bay pulp mill [Australia]</bold>. <italic>Environmental Politics</italic> 22(2), March 2013: 274–292.</p>
<p>Environmental politics is not always the outcome of the complex interplay of interests and institutions mediated by ideas. Sometimes naked self-interest prevails and proponents manipulate environmental institutions to achieve their goals. The way in which economic interests can trump environmental ideas and institutions is illustrated by the case of the proposed Bell Bay pulp mill in Tasmania, Australia, where Gunns Limited, a global timber company, sought permission to build a multi-billion dollar bleached kraft pulp mill. To expedite planning approval, the government backed the company in its decision to quit the state's environmental assessment system and put in place special legislation to deliver a sympathetic, fast-track review. While the Tasmanian case is a clear example of economic interests triumphing over environmental institutions, it is not unique. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This study analyzes the structure of incentives for introducing proportional representation into the institutional framework of authoritarianism by focusing on the 2004–2009 reform of Russia's regional election laws. Statistical analysis supports a preliminary theory and a set of hypotheses according to which the varying degrees of the use of proportional representation in Russia's regions are conditioned by the interests and strategies of the involved political actors, including power-maximization strategy of the federal authorities and the risk-aversion strategy of the regionlevel actors.

<p>63.4268 HUANG Haifeng — <bold>Signal left, turn right: central rhetoric and local reform in China</bold>. <italic>Political Research Quarterly</italic> 66(2), June 2013: 292–305.</p>
<p>How have local governments in China been able to break through central policy restrictions in a unitary and authoritarian political system? Why is China's official discourse in the reform era often so conservative and unfavorable to reform? The author argues the two issues are components of a signaling game between China's central government and local officials, in which local officials know that the center may be reformist, but the reformist center imitates the rhetoric of a conservative center to control the pace of local liberalization. The result is a gradualist reform of “signaling left, turning right,” with glaring incongruity of speech and actions in the process. [R]</p>
<p>63.4269 KELLY, Josie; LLOYD-WILLIAMS, Philip — <bold>Master and apprentice or difference and complementarity? Local government practitioners [in the UK], doctoral studies and co-produced research</bold>. <italic>Local Government Studies</italic> 39(2), 2013: 235–252.</p>
<p>In their search for innovative policy solutions to complex social problematics, local governance practitioners look to synergizing specific policy guidance from government departments with conceptual scientific research outputs. UK academics are also now expected to emphasize the relevance of their research and to increase its utilization by practitioners. Away from utilitarian pressures, academics from applied discipline, such as Public Administration and Local Government Studies, are increasingly drawn to the benefits of co-produced research. Despite the pressure for more co-research, there are few opportunities for practitioners and academics to nurture relationships that would support close collaboration. This paper looks at the opportunity for closer collaboration when practitioners undertake research degrees, in order to enhance their cognitive skills and develop greater scientific knowledge of particular policy domains.

<p>63.4270 KJAER, Ulrik — <bold>Local political leadership [in Denmark]: the art of circulating political capital</bold>. <italic>Local Government Studies</italic> 39(2), 2013: 253–272.</p>
<p>Based on intensive case studies of the political leadership performance of four mayors in Denmark, this article asks why the concept of political capital has in many ways sunk into oblivion. It resuscitates the concept, using it to generate a general theory of local political leadership. In this framework, the crucial component of effective leadership is the mayor's ability, within a given institutional framework, to circulate (earn and spend) political capital. Effective leadership occurs when the leader continuously invests his or her political capital in ways which yield the greatest return. C.N. Stone's distinction between “power over” and “power to” is central to the model. Mayors performing what J.H. Svara has labeled “facilitative leadership” can in some cases accumulate substantial amounts of political capital. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4271 KRAUSE, George A.; LEWIS, David E.; DOUGLAS, James W. — <bold>Politics can limit policy opportunism in fiscal institutions: evidence from official general fund revenue forecasts in the American states</bold>. <italic>Journal of Policy Analysis and Management</italic> 32(2), Spring 2013: 271–295.</p>
<p>Governments make policy decisions in the same areas in quite different institutions. Some assign policy-making responsibility to institutions designed to be insulated from myopic partisan and electoral pressures and others do not. We claim that differences in political context and institutional design constrain the policy choices governments make. Testable propositions based on an analysis of varying electoral incentives and time horizons created by these different contexts are empirically tested using panel data on official general fund revenue forecasts in the American states, 1987 to 2008. The empirical evidence reveals that executive branch agencies and independent commissions produce more conservative forecasts than legislatures with one important exception. Executive branch revenue forecasts in states with gubernatorial term-limits are indistinguishable from legislative branch forecasts. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4272 KUKOVIC, Simona; HACEK, Miro — <bold>The re-election of mayors in the Slovenian local self-government</bold>. <italic>Lex Localis (Journal of Local Self Government)</italic> 11(2), Apr. 2013: 87–100.</p>
<p>This paper analyzes the political career of a key executive body in the Slovenian local self-government system: the mayor. The paper first introduces incumbency advantage theories, [which] argue that the probability of electoral victory or defeat is not homogeneously distributed among the candidates, as several factors influence the possibilities of success of some candidates and the failure of others (seniority, membership of political parties, electoral performance, etc.). Based on an analysis of objective data and data from an empirical survey conducted among mayors of Slovenian municipalities, we look at the re-election of mayors in Slovenian local self-government with the emphasis on their seniority. We find that the re-election of mayors is a frequent occurrence in Slovenia, a trend that has increased with every local election thus far. [R]</p>
<p>63.4273 SCHAAP, Linze; KARSTEN, Niels; CACHET, Lex — <bold>The Dutch anomaly: appointed mayors. Can appointed mayors cope with role changes and societal demands?</bold> <italic>Lex Localis (Journal of Local Self Government)</italic> 11(2), Apr. 2013: 177–192.</p>
<p>In many European countries mayors are local political leaders. Dutch mayors, however, are neither local nor political, as national government appoints them. Their office is subject to serious changes. While it still carries a lot of “natural” authority, its content has changed rather drastically. We give an overview of the mayoral office in Western Europe and sketch the Dutch mayorship. We [then] discuss recent developments: councils gaining influence on the actual mayoral selection, mayors getting more legal capacities and responsibilities, and society demanding stronger (mayoral) leadership. We explore the ways present mayors cope with the emerging tensions between these developments, and between the responses to them. The focus is on tensions between the various developments and the risks the mayorship runs. [R]</p>
<p>63.4274 STASIULIS, Daiva — <bold>Worrier nation: Quebec's [Canada] value codes for immigrants</bold>. <italic>Politikon (South African Journal of Political Studies)</italic> 40(1), Apr. 2013: 183–209.</p>
<p>This article analyzes the political and policy discourses of Quebec's integration toolkit for immigrants. With a focus on value codes for immigrants, I argue first, that recent debate on accommodation of immigrants and religious minorities resuscitates the dominant historical narrative of Quebec's fragility as a conquered settler colonial nation but where the major threat is defined as the cultural otherness of racialized immigrants and religious minorities. Second, such value codes instantiate a form of governmental strategy that combines neo-liberal and communitarian rationalities and insist on cultural assimilation as the price of entry into Quebec citizenship. Finally, the paper examines how Quebec's current national imaginary of the “worrier nation” maps spatially onto the urban-rural divide. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4036]</p>
<p>63.4275 TOKE, David, <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>Scotland [UK], renewable energy and the independence debate: will head or heart rule the roost?</bold> <italic>Political Quarterly</italic> 84(1), Jan.-March 2013: 61–70.</p>
<p>Political support for renewable energy development, especially offshore renewables, is particularly conspicuous in Scotland and is a centerpiece of SNP policy. However, this is built on something of a paradox because, put simply, without the subsidies paid by electricity consumers in the rest of the UK, the Scottish Government's ambitious targets for renewable energy would be politically unachievable. We argue that if Scotland does move towards independence, then there could be little reason for the UK to continue paying (much) of the subsidies since the resulting renewable generation would no longer contribute towards UK renewable energy targets. We suggest that the potential scenarios, and their implications, need to be far better considered in the arguments around the Scottish constitutional position and the broader aims of UK energy policy.

<p>63.4276 VERHELST, Tom; REYNAERT, Herwig; STEYVERS, Kristof — <bold>Necessary asymmetry or undemocratic imbalance? Professionalisation in the recruitment and career of Belgian local councillors</bold>. <italic>Local Government Studies</italic> 39(2), 2013: 273–297.</p>
<p>The alleged professionalization of the local councilor underpins a fundamental debate on the state of local politics. Does professionalization entail an asymmetry in the councilor population that is necessary to govern localities in the 21st c., or is it hard to comply with the very nature of representative local democracy — creating an undemocratic imbalance between professionals and laymen in local government? This article outlines the extent of, and relation between, layman politics and professionalization in the recruitment and career of Belgian local councilors. After scrutinizing these elements separately in a descriptive section, both are linked in a subsequent explanatory analysis, verifying whether professionalized recruitment in a given political system results in professionalized careers. The article uses quantitative survey data gathered from a selection of 856 Belgian local councilors. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper analyzes the institutional mechanisms for relations between government and social organizations in three Mexican states: Jalisco, Michoacán and Nuevo León. Using as parameters of analysis, inclusion/exclusion levels, transparency and incidence opportunity, it seeks to determine how the use of these mechanisms contributes to the democratization of public policy. In the absence of an appropriate legal framework, the design and execution of support and service programs for civil groups is subject to government discretion and to its particular definition of citizen participation.

<p>63.4278 WU, Alfred M. — <bold>How does decentralized governance work? Evidence from China</bold>. <italic>Journal of Contemporary China</italic> 81, May 2013: 379–393.</p>
<p>Decentralized governance is often viewed as an effective way to improve public services and government accountability. Many also document the negative dimensions of fiscal decentralization, especially in transition economies; thus, the combination of decentralization and centralized control has gained currency in some countries in recent years. Based on first-hand data and other documentary sources, and using civil service remuneration as an example, this paper attempts to explore how decentralized governance works in China and what hinders decentralization from performing better.
