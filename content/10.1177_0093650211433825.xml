<abstract>
<p>Organizational members vary in their ability to accurately recognize each other’s expertise. The goal of this study is to extend transactive memory theory to understand how organizational group members develop accurate perceptions of others’ knowledge through a multidimensional access to expertise cues. Specifically, this study examines how a group member’s accuracy in expertise recognition is influenced by one’s centralities in the communication network, use of digital knowledge repositories, and work remoteness. By analyzing data collected from 208 individuals from 17 organizational groups, this study found that a member’s accuracy in expertise recognition was positively influenced by one’s degree centrality in the communication network and negatively influenced by the extent to which one’s work was done remotely. Furthermore, there was an interaction effect between work remoteness and use of digital knowledge repositories such that the negative influence of work remoteness on expertise recognition was weaker when members used digital knowledge repositories.</p>

<p>The burgeoning popularity of social media has demonstrated the importance of leveraging social capital based on “who knows whom” in one’s social and professional network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211433825">Ellison, Steinfield, &amp; Lampe, 2007</xref>). However, in the emerging knowledge economy driven by the utilization and coordination of individual expertise, intellectual or knowledge capital based on “who knows what” has become an even more critical driving force of individual performance and organizational profits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093650211433825">Novak, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0093650211433825">Stewart, 2001</xref>). As stated in a print advisement of the former Morgan Stanley Dean Witter company, it is not “who you know” but “what who you know knows” that plays a more important role in managing today’s organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211433825">Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Knowledge, however, is not homogeneously distributed among organizational group members. As people vary in their natural competency, educational background, task assignments, training, and work experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650211433825">Bunderson, 2003</xref>), group members tend to possess varied levels of expertise in different knowledge domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0093650211433825">Stasser, Stewart, &amp; Wittenbaum, 1995</xref>). In addition, individually held expertise may not be readily apparent to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093650211433825">Littlepage &amp; Mueller, 1997</xref>). Thus group members face a great challenge in accurately identifying their coworkers’ areas and levels of expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211433825">Littlepage, Hollingshead, Drake, &amp; Littlepage, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>While there is an abundance of literature that underscores the importance and benefits of attaining an accurate perception of group members’ expertise (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211433825">Littlepage et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0093650211433825">Peltokorpi, 2008</xref>), little is known about what contributes to or hinders an individual’s accuracy in expertise recognition within a work group. In those studies that have attempted to address this question, they were limited to examining individual characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650211433825">Bunderson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093650211433825">Littlepage &amp; Mueller, 1997</xref>) and formal work procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211433825">Henry, 1995</xref>) without considering the effects of group members’ communication networks. Furthermore, as today’s organizations are increasingly adopting a virtual form of working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211433825">DeSanctis &amp; Monge, 1999</xref>) and implementing digital knowledge management tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211433825">Flanagin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211433825">Jackson &amp; Williamson, 2010</xref>), there is a pressing need to study the impacts of these new trends in group work on members’ accuracy in expertise recognition.</p>
<p>To bridge these research gaps, this study seeks to extend transactive memory theory to understand how work group members develop accurate expertise recognition through a multidimensional access to expertise cues in the group. To this end, this study examines group members’ expertise recognition processes that cut across multiple communication dimensions: structural, temporal, and spatial. Specifically, this study unravels how a group member’s accuracy in expertise recognition can be influenced by the communication network factors (degree and betweenness centralities in the communication network), technology factors (use of digital knowledge repositories), and virtuality factors (work remoteness). As these mechanisms expand the traditional communication dimensions in which group members access expertise cues, an integrated examination of how these mechanisms work together to influence expertise recognition will enhance our understanding of transactive memory development in contemporary organizational work groups.</p>

<title>Expertise Recognition in Transactive Memory Theory</title>
<p>Transactive memory theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0093650211433825">Wegner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0093650211433825">Wegner, Giuliano, &amp; Hertel, 1985</xref>) explains how a group of individuals use distributed knowledge through a process of expertise recognition, information retrieval, and information allocation (for a thorough review of this theory, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211433825">Hollingshead &amp; Brandon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0093650211433825">Palazzolo, 2010</xref>). Transactive memory is a combination of domain-specific knowledge possessed by individual members and a shared understanding of expertise location within the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093650211433825">Moreland, 1999</xref>). Transactive memory is “transactive” because it is through a communicative process that knowledge is encoded, stored, and retrieved within the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211433825">Gupta &amp; Hollingshead, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Expertise recognition is the prerequisite and foundation on which a transactive memory system can be effectively developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211433825">Gupta &amp; Hollingshead, 2010</xref>). According to transactive memory theory, individuals develop an internal memory of “who knows what” by encoding the subject of a knowledge domain and identifying the location of experts in that domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093650211433825">Nevo &amp; Wand, 2005</xref>). Thus an individual is able to label what each other knows without necessarily knowing the knowledge itself. As group members specialize in their own areas of expertise, the overlap of expertise within the group is reduced and each member can access a larger pool of expertise across different knowledge domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211433825">Hollingshead, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211433825">Littlepage et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The accuracy in expertise recognition is influenced by the directory updating process in transactive memory development over time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0093650211433825">Wegner (1995)</xref> asserts that group members’ directories of others’ expertise should be constantly updated in order to maintain the accuracy in expertise recognition. During the directory updating process, previous underestimation or overestimation of other members’ expertise level can be corrected, and a new directory of emerging experts in the group can be created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211433825">Hollingshead, 2000</xref>). Directory updating typically happens via allocating and retrieving information through interpersonal communication within the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0093650211433825">Wegner, 1995</xref>). For example, when group members receive outdated or erroneous information from a previously recognized expert, they would lower their evaluations of the expert’s expertise level in the relevant domain. Likewise, when group members come across a new expert through work coordination and interpersonal communication, they would update their directories of perceived experts in the group accordingly.</p>
<p>In reality, however, the directories of others’ expertise may not always be accurately updated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211433825">Littlepage, Robison, &amp; Reddington, 1997</xref>). When group members have limited access to accurate expertise cues or have acquired outdated or erroneous expertise cues, they may update their directories of “who knows what” with inaccurate information. Consequently, they are likely to retrieve incorrect or low-quality information from the wrong experts, invest more time and efforts in relocating the true experts, or even learn to become knowledgeable in those domains beyond their areas of expertise. Thus inaccurate expertise recognition may ultimately lead to decreased efficiency, increased work load, and lower quality in group task completion. Therefore, it is imperative to unravel the factors that would enhance or hinder group members’ expertise recognition, especially in those knowledge domains that directly pertain to the completion of group tasks.</p>

<title>Multidimensional Access to Expertise Cues</title>
<p>Members of organizational work groups have access to various types of expertise cues that can help them make informed evaluations on others’ expertise. At the initial stage of transactive memory development, people’s perceptions of each other’s expertise can be shaped by expert role assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0093650211433825">Stewart &amp; Stasser, 1995</xref>), negotiation and acceptance of job responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0093650211433825">Wegner, 1995</xref>), social categorization, and stereotypes of demographic attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211433825">Hollingshead, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211433825">Hollingshead &amp; Fraidin, 2003</xref>). During the course of group activities and task accomplishments, group members can use a wider array of expertise cues to verify their initial perceptions of coworkers’ expertise. These expertise cues include a member’s tenure in the group or relevant industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0093650211433825">Wegner, 1995</xref>), ranking of task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093650211433825">Moreland &amp; Myaskovsky, 2000</xref>), revelation of past work experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0093650211433825">Wittenbaum, 2000</xref>), shared group membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211433825">Hollingshead, 2000</xref>), and assertive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211433825">Littlepage, Schmidt, Whisler, &amp; Frost, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Originated to understand how dyads and small groups recognize and coordinate distributed expertise, traditional transactive memory research tends to focus on individual’s access to expertise cues in a limited and rigid communication dimension. Much research attention has been paid to studying how group members perceive others’ expertise through one-on-one, synchronous, and collocated communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211433825">Hollingshead, 2000</xref>). However, in today’s organizations, group work is carried out in a multiplicity of communication dimensions that entail structural, spatial, and temporal expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211433825">Fulk, Monge, &amp; Hollingshead, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211433825">Hollingshead &amp; Contractor, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211433825">Schreiber &amp; Engelmann, 2010</xref>). First, group members can access expertise cues by communicating with not just one or a few other members but through a communication network that include not only humans but also technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211433825">Contractor, Monge, &amp; Leonardi, 2011</xref>). Group members’ expertise recognition is influenced by the structure of the communication network as well as their central positions in the communication network. Thus the emergence of communication networks signifies the structural expansion of the communication dimension in which transactive memory develops. Second, the wide diffusion of digital knowledge repositories allows group members to access expertise cues with fewer temporal and spatial constraints. Last, the increasing degree of virtuality in today’s workplace requires group members to engage in more creative and diversified communication dimensions to access expertise cues in the group.</p>
<p>Together, the communication network, technology, and virtuality factors characterize how communication has evolved in the structural, temporal, and spatial dimensions in today’s organizations. Therefore, this study focuses on examining how a group member’s accuracy in expertise recognition can be influenced by one’s centralities in the communication network, use of digital knowledge repositories, and work remoteness.</p>

<title>Effects of Network Centralities on Expertise Recognition</title>
<p>Transactive memory development does not take place in a vacuum. In fact, the name “transactive” indicates that it is through an interactive and communicative process that group members develop a shared understanding of each other’s expertise and use each other’s knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211433825">Gupta &amp; Hollingshead, 2010</xref>). In order to develop and maintain an accurate perception of coworkers’ expertise, group members need to get to know their fellow members in the group so that they are able to identify and validate what others know through talking, discussion, advice seeking, and exchange of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211433825">Littlepage et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093650211433825">Moreland, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0093650211433825">Wegner, Erber, &amp; Raymond, 1991</xref>). Therefore, interpersonal communication plays a vital role in influencing group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211433825">Hollingshead, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>A thriving approach to studying how people communicate within groups and organizations is the social network perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211433825">Cross &amp; Parker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093650211433825">Monge &amp; Contractor, 2003</xref>). The social network approach is characterized by its focus on structural properties of the interrelationships among a collective of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093650211433825">Monge &amp; Eisenberg, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0093650211433825">Wasserman &amp; Faust, 1994</xref>). In transactive memory research, scholars have conceptualized transactive memory system as a network of individual minds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0093650211433825">Wegner, 1986</xref>) and examined how transactive memory development can be influenced by different dimensions of network properties such as the strength of communication ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0093650211433825">Yuan, Fulk, Monge, &amp; Contractor, 2010</xref>), nodal centrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0093650211433825">Tsai, 2001</xref>), reciprocity of information seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093650211433825">Palazzolo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0093650211433825">Su, Huang, &amp; Contractor, 2010</xref>), structural holes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211433825">Burt, 1992</xref>), and network centralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0093650211433825">Rulke &amp; Galaskiewicz, 2000</xref>). These studies have demonstrated that transactive memory is not an individual property developed isolatedly but is enabled and constrained by the communication network composed of all group members and the relationships among them.</p>
<sec id="section5-0093650211433825">
<title>Degree centrality</title>
<p>The relative importance and influence of an individual member in a communication network can be determined by that member’s centrality in the network, that is, how and with whom the member is connected in the communication network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093650211433825">Feeley &amp; Barnett, 1997</xref>). One of the most prominent measures of centrality in a communication network is <italic>degree centrality</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093650211433825">1</xref></sup> which gauges the quantity and strength of direct communication ties a member has with other members in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211433825">Barnett, Danowski, Feeley, &amp; Stalker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211433825">Freeman, 1979</xref>). A high degree centrality in a communication network indicates that this member communicates directly with many other members on a frequent basis, which makes this member a very active and central player in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0093650211433825">Wasserman &amp; Faust, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous research has shed light on the potential effects of a member’s network centrality on one’s accuracy in expertise recognition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211433825">Littlepage et al. (1995)</xref> found that the perceived expertise was most closely predicted by the extent of talking within the group. For a member with a high degree centrality, the opportunity of talking and interacting directly with many other members significantly increases, which makes it easier and faster for this member to discover and verify expertise cues that are essential for making the most accurate judgment about others’ knowledge.</p>
<p>As the communication network has become an important and pervasive vehicle for seeking and sharing work-related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211433825">Cross, Rice, &amp; Parker, 2001</xref>), it has effectively transformed and expanded the communication structure in which group members can access expertise cues. Therefore, a member with a high degree centrality in the communication network would have a greater advantage in learning “who knows what” across different work-related knowledge domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211433825">Brandon &amp; Hollingshead, 2004</xref>), thereby develop a more accurate perception of others members’ expertise.</p>

<sec id="section6-0093650211433825">
<title>Betweenness centrality</title>
<p>Degree centrality is not the only measure of an individual’s central location in a communication network. Another important index of network centrality is <italic>betweenness centrality</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0093650211433825">2</xref></sup> which measures the degree to which a member directly communicates with those members who do not communicate among themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211433825">Freeman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0093650211433825">Wasserman &amp; Faust, 1994</xref>). In a communication network, a member with a high betweenness centrality is situated in a strategically important position that controls communication and information exchange between those members who lack direct communication relationships themselves. This member is often referred to as a <italic>broker</italic> who fills the <italic>structural holes</italic> and is able to garner a substantial level of social capital in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211433825">Burt, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211433825">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The higher betweenness centrality a member has in the communication network, the more structural holes this member would fill and the greater brokerage role this member would play in the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093650211433825">Monge &amp; Contractor, 2003</xref>). Consequently, members with a high betweenness centrality enjoy a unique privilege in learning about and accessing the expertise cues of those members who are bridged by them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093650211433825">Moreland, 1999</xref>). In extreme cases, such brokers can even strategically hide or deceptively share what they know about the expertise of those members with whom they connect, so that those members would develop an inaccurate recognition of each other’s expertise and the brokers would gain a unique competitive edge in the group. In short, although a member with a high betweenness centrality may not necessarily have a high degree centrality at the same time, this member is also likely to develop an accurate perception of other members’ expertise.</p>

<title>Effects of Digital Knowledge Repositories on Expertise Recognition</title>
<p>Communication is a crucial yet not the only driving force of transactive memory development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211433825">Hollingshead (2000)</xref> argues that even with the absence of interpersonal communication, people are still able to identify each other’s areas of expertise through impersonal knowledge directories such as documented work procedures, published manuals, and other codified reference materials. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093650211433825">Moreland and Myaskovsky (2000)</xref> found that in groups whose members did not communicate with each other during the learning process, if they were provided with a list of group members’ expertise, they would perform just as well as those groups whose members communicated with one another. Increasingly, this type of external directory of “who knows what” has become available in various forms of digital knowledge repositories such as organizational intranets and electronic databases. These knowledge management tools have emerged to serve as an alternative source to inform their users about what people know and what they are willing to share in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211433825">Hollingshead, Fulk, &amp; Monge, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The effects of using digital knowledge repositories on expertise recognition are twofold. First, the digital knowledge repository can publish an explicit directory of group members’ areas of expertise or work responsibility, which supplements individually held directories of each other’s expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093650211433825">Moreland, 1999</xref>). As the digital knowledge repository is typically established and maintained by group or organizational managers, it provides users the most direct access to an official listing of designated experts in the group.</p>
<p>Second, the digital knowledge repository stores and publishes information contributed by individual members such as answers to questions, solutions to problems, advices, experiences, reference materials, and so forth. Unless posted anonymously, such information can be used as effective cues to infer about the contributor’s expertise in the relevant knowledge domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0093650211433825">Stein &amp; Zwass, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In fact, Fulk et al. have conceptualized two types of knowledge in transactive memory development: <italic>connective</italic> and <italic>communal</italic> knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211433825">Fulk, Flanagin, Kalman, Monge, &amp; Ryan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0093650211433825">Yuan, Fulk, &amp; Monge, 2007</xref>). The connective knowledge refers to individual expertise that can be sought through direct interpersonal communication, whereas the communal knowledge refers to collectively shared knowledge repository systems where group members have equal access to information contributed by experts. The digital knowledge repository provides a communal and virtual venue for group members to identify, evaluate, and share what each other knows in the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211433825">Fulk et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211433825">Hollingshead et al., 2002</xref>). More importantly, it allows members to access expertise cues in an expanded communication dimension with fewer temporal and spatial constraints, which leads to a more flexible development of accurate expertise recognition in the group.</p>

<title>Effects of Work Remoteness on Expertise Recognition</title>
<p>Enabled by advanced information and communication technologies, more and more work groups have adopted a virtual form of working and collaborating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211433825">Boh, Ren, Kiesler, &amp; Bussjaeger, 2007</xref>). A virtual work group is characterized by geographical dispersion, functional or cultural diversity, and heavy reliance on electronic forms of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211433825">DeSanctis &amp; Monge, 1999</xref>). In a virtual work environment where face-to-face communication is deficient, transactive memory development is likely to be hindered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211433825">Schreiber &amp; Engelmann, 2010</xref>). Thus, a growing literature has started to examine how virtuality of group work could influence transactive memory development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211433825">Engelmann &amp; Hesse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211433825">Hollingshead et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093650211433825">Nevo &amp; Wand, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0093650211433825">Yoo &amp; Kanawattanachai, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In reality, few organizational groups work in a purely virtual form. Instead, many work groups tend to adopt a hybrid work style, such that part of their work is done in the traditional brick-and-mortar manner and part of it is done remotely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093650211433825">Haas, Koeszegi, &amp; Noester, 2007</xref>). Thus, this study focuses on examining how a group member’s accuracy in expertise recognition could be influenced by the extent to which her or his work is done remotely.</p>
<p>Originated to study dyads and small groups that are geographically collocated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0093650211433825">Wegner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0093650211433825">Wegner et al., 1991</xref>), transactive memory theory has long advocated for the positive influence of face-to-face communication on transactive memory development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211433825">Lewis, 2004</xref>). Numerous research has found that dyads or groups with frequent face-to-face communication are better at learning each other’s expertise and quicker at developing a meta-memory of “who knows what” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211433825">Hollingshead, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0093650211433825">Wegner et al., 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0093650211433825">1991</xref>).</p>
<p>However, when a large portion of group members’ work is done remotely, it creates a hurdle for them to closely observe each other’s behaviors and discern expertise cues. Furthermore, members who are frequently distant from the physical work setting are less likely to engage in social interactions or grapevine talks that often reveal the expertise cues of other members. Even though these members may be able to learn about others’ knowledge by alternative means, the learning and discovery process can be time-consuming and costly. Indeed, previous research has found that specialized expertise is more likely to be developed in local sites and that managers would be very reluctant to create remote work projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211433825">Boh et al., 2007</xref>). In short, due to the lack of face-to-face communication and interpersonal interactions, group members working remotely are less likely to become accurate in recognizing each other’s expertise.</p>

<sec id="section9-0093650211433825">
<title>Moderating role of digital knowledge repositories</title>
<p>The negative influence of work remoteness on expertise recognition may be mitigated by the use of digital knowledge repositories in the group. As discussed earlier, the digital knowledge repository serves as an effective tool to inform group members about each other’s expertise, regardless of the existence and strength of communication ties among them. Such a positive effect can be particularly strong and salient in groups where members are working remotely because they have stronger dependence on expertise cues disclosed on digital repositories and deficient access to expertise cues revealed through face-to-face communication. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093650211433825">Nevo and Wand (2005)</xref> suggest that although it is more difficult to develop a transactive memory system in a geographically dispersed organization, technologies can be effectively used to support the development an organization-wide directory of members’ expertise. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211433825">Engelmann and Hesse (2010)</xref> found that in geographically distributed but computer-supported collaborative groups, members’ awareness of each other’s knowledge can be greatly facilitated by using digital tools that visualize collaborators’ knowledge structures. Therefore, although geographical distance may be a disadvantage for members to accurately identify what others know, a frequent use of digital knowledge repositories can moderate the negative influence of work remoteness on accuracy in expertise recognition.</p>

<title>Method and Analysis</title>
<sec id="section11-0093650211433825">
<title>Sample and Procedures</title>
<p>Data for this study were collected from 208 individuals working in 17 organizational work groups across North America and Western Europe. These groups were selected from 8 organizations representing a broad range of industries: legal, research, aerospace, manufacturing, military, public relations, and consulting. All groups were preexisting work groups of their parent organizations, and group members had been working together for at least 6 months at the time of this study. In each group, all members were bound by the same goal to successfully accomplish common group tasks.</p>
<p>Each group had access to one or two digital knowledge repositories in the form of an intranet or database, where all members could read, publish, and retrieve task-related information. Groups ranged in size from 5 to 20 members (median size = 13). Sixty-eight percent of the respondents were men and 78% had a bachelor’s degree or higher. Respondents had an average tenure of 3.272 years in the group (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.531) and an average age of 37.177 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.943).</p>
<p>Prior to data collection, leaders of each group completed a presurvey interview to identify their primary tasks as well as the key knowledge domains that were essential for their task completion. There were a total of 99 knowledge domains across these 17 groups, ranging from 4 to 8 key knowledge domains in each group. Then a web-based survey was customized for each group based on the number of knowledge domains identified and the roster of participating members. Finally, the survey was distributed to members in each group to be completed online. The response rate in each group was 100%. All members answered the survey, although a very small percentage of respondents chose not to answer a few questions.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section13-0093650211433825">
<title>Accuracy in expertise recognition</title>
<p>The dependent variable in this study is group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition. This study measured this variable by computing the degree of similarity between a group member’s perceptions of other members’ knowledge and other members’ self-reported knowledge across all knowledge domains. In the survey, respondents were asked to report their perceptions of the knowledge level of all group members (including themselves) in each of the key knowledge domains identified for the group. The response set for perceived knowledge level included <italic>none</italic> (coded as 0), <italic>beginner</italic> (1), <italic>intermediate</italic> (2), and <italic>expert</italic> (3). To calculate member <italic>i</italic>’s accuracy in recognizing member <italic>j</italic>’s expertise in a particular knowledge domain, the difference between member <italic>i</italic>’s perception of member <italic>j</italic>’s knowledge level and member <italic>j</italic>’s self-reported knowledge level in that knowledge domain was computed. Then the absolute value of the difference was subtracted from 3 (the biggest difference possible), and the output score was used to measure member <italic>i</italic>’s accuracy in recognizing member <italic>j</italic>’s expertise in that particular knowledge domain. The higher the score, the greater similarity between member <italic>i</italic>’s perception of member <italic>j</italic>’s expertise and member <italic>j</italic>’s self-reported expertise in that knowledge domain. Then the same procedure was repeated for member <italic>i</italic>’s perception of the knowledge level of every other member in the same group and in every other knowledge domain. The mean value of these scores was used as the final measure of member <italic>i</italic>’s accuracy in expertise recognition in the group.</p>
<p>The above approach to measuring accuracy in expertise recognition has been recommended and validated by previous research on expertise recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211433825">Austin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211433825">Littlepage et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093650211433825">Littlepage &amp; Silbiger, 1992</xref>). Early transactive memory literature suggests to use self-reported measure as an accurate indicator of personal knowledge because self-reported expertise has a profound impact on the amount, style, and substance of a member’s participation in group work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093650211433825">Littlepage &amp; Silbiger, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211433825">Austin (2003)</xref> further validates the use of self-reported measure of personal expertise in continuing organizational work groups. In the study, he used two approaches to measuring group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition. The first approach was to match a member’s ratings of others’ knowledge with others’ self-reported knowledge, and the second approach was to compare a member’s ratings of others’ knowledge with others’ performance in problem-solving scenarios. He chose the self-reported approach over the performance approach as the final measure of a member’s accuracy in expertise recognition because self-reported knowledge could most appropriately represent one’s true knowledge level when the member has had the opportunity to repeatedly assess her or his skills in naturally occurring work settings. Thus this study used the same approach to measure accuracy in expertise recognition as it is “consistent with past research on self-report of ability and is easier to replicate for future studies of transactive memory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211433825">Austin, 2003</xref>, p. 870).</p>

<title>Communication network centralities</title>
<p>In the survey, respondents were asked to report their frequency of communication with every other member on a 7-point scale from <italic>never</italic> to <italic>once per day</italic>. These data were converted into a matrix for each group. The data in the cell <italic>ij</italic> of the matrix represented the frequency of communication reported by member <italic>i</italic> to member <italic>j</italic>. As this study focused on a nondirectional measure of degree centrality (see Note 1), this matrix was then symmetrized by the mean value of member <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>’s reported communication frequency to each other. Thus the data in the cell <italic>ij</italic> of the symmetrized matrix represented the mutually agreed frequency of communication between member <italic>i</italic> and member <italic>j</italic>. This matrix was imported into a social network analysis program, UCINET 6.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211433825">Borgatti, Everett, &amp; Freeman, 2002</xref>), which computed the degree centrality and betweenness centrality scores for each group member. To control for the influence of variances in group size and network density, this study followed the approach taken by previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0093650211433825">Sparrowe, Liden, Wayne, &amp; Kraimer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0093650211433825">Xia, Yuan, &amp; Gay, 2009</xref>) by using the normalized scores of degree and betweenness centralities in data analysis. The range of a normalized network centrality is between 0 and 100.</p>

<title>Use of digital knowledge repositories</title>
<p>This variable was measured by a seven-item scale in the survey. These questions asked respondents to report their frequency in using the organizational digital knowledge repository for information seeking and expertise identification (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0093650211433825">appendix</xref> for details).

<sec id="section16-0093650211433825">
<title>Work remoteness</title>
<p>The survey asked respondents to indicate the percentage of their work that was done remotely (e.g., at home, in the car, while traveling, etc.). The response set for this question included <italic>0, 1-20%, 21-40%, 41-60%, 61-80%</italic>, and <italic>81-100%</italic>.</p>

<title>Control variables</title>
<p>This study collected demographic information including age, gender, education, organizational rank (hierarchical status in the group), and tenure from all group members. As these variables were beyond the focus of this research but might influence the outcome variable, their effects were controlled in the data analysis. Group size was also a control variable due to inconsistent findings on its effects on expertise recognition in previous transactive memory literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093650211433825">Littlepage &amp; Silbiger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093650211433825">Nevo &amp; Wand, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093650211433825">Ren, Carley, &amp; Argote, 2006</xref>). To eliminate its influence on the outcome variable in this study, group size was also controlled in the analysis.</p>

<sec id="section18-0093650211433825">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>This study used multiple regression analysis to test the hypotheses. In the regression analysis, a block of control variables was entered first, including gender, age, education, organizational rank, tenure, and group size. Then a block of predictor variables proposed in the hypotheses (degree and betweenness centralities, use of digital knowledge repositories, and work remoteness) was entered. Finally, the interaction term (the product of work remoteness and use of digital knowledge repositories) was entered together with the previous blocks of variables to test the moderating effects of the use of digital knowledge repositories on the relationship between work remoteness and accuracy in expertise recognition.</p>
<p>Due to the nesting structure in the data collected in this study (i.e., 208 individuals nested within 17 organizational groups), there might be grouping effects that could make individual members behave similarly within the same group and behave differently across groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0093650211433825">Snijders &amp; Bosker, 1999</xref>). Given that this study does not focus on cross-level interactions or group variances in accurate expertise recognition and that the group-level sample size is not large enough, it is not appropriate to perform a robust multilevel analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211433825">Hox, 2002</xref>). Following the recommendations provided in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211433825">Kreft, Leeuw, &amp; Aiken, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093650211433825">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>), this study chose to remove the grouping effects by group-mean-centering the variables prior to regression analysis. The new data for a particular variable were the differences between the original data and the group mean of that particular variable. In this way, the new data more accurately represented group members’ behaviors or attitudes at the individual level with the grouping effects removed. The validity of this approach has been reported and verified in other methodological and empirical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093650211433825">Paccagnella, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0093650211433825">Park, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0093650211433825">Xia et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>The first hypothesis predicted that a group member’s degree centrality in the communication network would have a positive influence on this member’s accurate perception of others’ expertise. Hypothesis 1 was supported because when controlling for the effects of demographic data and group size, degree centrality showed a significant positive influence on accuracy in expertise recognition (β = .339, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; see Step 2). The effect remained significant after the interaction term of work remoteness and use of digital knowledge repositories was added to the model (β = .342, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; see Step 3).</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2 speculated a positive relationship between betweenness centrality in the communication network and accuracy in expertise recognition. This hypothesis was not supported in either Step 2 (β = .011, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) or Step 3 (β = .015, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). The third hypothesis stated that the use of digital knowledge repositories would positively predict group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition. The results did not support Hypothesis 3 in either Step 2 (β = .030, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) or Step 3 (β = .027, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>The fourth hypothesis predicted that a higher degree of remote work would lead to a less accurate perception of others’ expertise. Hypothesis 4 was supported because when controlling for the effects of demographic data and group size, a group member’s work remoteness showed a negative influence on one’s accuracy in expertise recognition (β = –.166, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; see Step 2). The negative effect remained significant after the interaction term of work remoteness and use of digital knowledge repository was added to the model (β = –.167, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; see Step 3).</p>
<p>Finally, the last hypothesis predicted an interaction effect of work remoteness and use of digital knowledge repositories on group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition. This hypothesis was supported because the interaction term entered in the last step was significantly positive (β = .143, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; see Step 3). This result showed that the use of digital knowledge repositories moderated the relationship between work remoteness and accuracy in expertise recognition such that the negative influence of work remoteness on group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition was weaker when group members were using digital knowledge repositories (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0093650211433825">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of this study is to address an important yet understudied question faced by many organizational work groups: What makes some members more accurate in recognizing their coworkers’ expertise than others? To answer this question, this study extends transactive memory theory to examine group members’ multidimensional access to expertise cues, which is influenced by the network, technology, and virtuality factors. The results showed that a group member’s accuracy in expertise recognition was positively influenced by one’s degree centrality in the communication network and negatively influenced by the extent to which one’s work was done remotely. Unlike what was predicted, this study did not find a significant effect of a member’s betweenness centrality and use of digital knowledge repositories on accurate expertise recognition. However, the negative influence of work remoteness on accuracy in expertise recognition was weaker when group members were using digital knowledge repositories. Taken together, these findings suggest that group members benefit from a multidimensional access to expertise cues, which is enabled and constrained by the structural properties of group members’ communication networks, use of knowledge-management technologies, and work remoteness.</p>
<sec id="section21-0093650211433825">
<title>Contrasting Effects of Communication Network Centralities</title>
<p>Over the past decade, organizational researchers and practitioners have embraced a network perspective in conceptualizing and analyzing communication processes in group and organizational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211433825">Casciaro &amp; Lobo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211433825">Contractor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093650211433825">Monge &amp; Contractor, 2003</xref>). This study is among the first to theorize and empirically test the effects of network centralities on expertise recognition in transactive memory development. Although previous research has highlighted the influence of network centralities on enhancing group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211433825">Brandon &amp; Hollingshead, 2004</xref>), it lacks an empirical validation and a nuanced examination of the specific type of network centrality that could potentially influence transactive memory development. Indeed, this study found that not all types of network centralities would lead to a more accurate perception of coworkers’ expertise. While degree centrality had a strong positive effect on group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition, betweenness centrality had no significant influence (despite a positive correlation between betweenness centrality and accuracy in expertise recognition: <italic>r</italic> = .226, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093650211433825">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The contrasting effects of degree and betweenness centralities can be attributable to the different scope of influence each of the two centralities exerts on the communication network. The influence of degree centrality is substantially driven by the quantity and strength of a member’s communication ties with all other members in the entire network but the influence of betweenness centrality is solely determined by the degree to which this member connects others who are not connected themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211433825">Huffaker, 2010</xref>). Thus while a high degree centrality indicates a more active and extensive communication pattern on a macro level, a high betweenness centrality is achieved through a specific configuration in a local segment of the communication network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211433825">Feeley, Hwang, &amp; Barnett, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Group members with high degree centralities in the network enjoy a structural prestige in accessing expertise cues of many other members and can use a multitude of information sources to develop and verify their perceptions of others’ expertise. In contrast, members with high betweenness centralities may become very accurate in recognizing the expertise of those members whom they bridge in the network but not necessarily of those who are not affected by their brokerage roles.</p>
<p>In the long run, group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition may in turn influence their centralities in the communication network. As a result of the multidimensional access to expertise cues, group members may become increasingly accurate in identifying “who knows what” in the group. Thus they may become more selective and strategic in establishing, maintaining, and even dissolving communication ties with other members based on their perceptions of others’ expertise. Consequently, the structure of the communication network will evolve in the group, and group members will attain new centralities in the communication network. To further investigate this reciprocal effect between expertise recognition and communication networks, future research should conduct longitudinal studies to examine the coevolution of accuracy in expertise recognition and communication network centralities.</p>

<sec id="section22-0093650211433825">
<title>Conditional Influence of Digital Knowledge Repositories</title>
<p>Unlike what was hypothesized, this study did not find a significant influence of using digital knowledge repositories on group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition. This finding lends support to previous arguments that the effectiveness of digital knowledge repositories is not self-evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211433825">Flanagin, 2002</xref>). Despite the popular belief that digital knowledge repositories will indisputably benefit knowledge-management processes, the pragmatic values of using such systems are yet to be fully realized and should be examined with caution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211433825">Blackman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211433825">Haas, 2010</xref>). Previous research found that when group members were seeking information from digital knowledge repositories, it saved time during task completion but did not improve work quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211433825">Haas &amp; Hansen, 2007</xref>). As reflected in this study, the mere use of digital knowledge repositories would not significantly enhance a member’s accuracy in expertise recognition.</p>
<p>There are several possible explanations for the lack of effects of using digital knowledge repositories on expertise recognition. First, digital knowledge repositories may not always publish the most accurate and up-to-date information, and thus users run the risks of retrieving outdated and incomplete expertise cues about others’ knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211433825">Hollingshead et al., 2002</xref>). Second, when contributing information to digital knowledge repositories, experts may be inclined to withhold identification information due to the conflict between collective and personal interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211433825">Kalman, Monge, Fulk, &amp; Heino, 2002</xref>). For example, expertise providers may intentionally hide personal identification or use pseudonyms in order to protect themselves from receiving requests for further information. Consequently, information seekers would face a great challenge in accurately identifying the true identify of expertise providers on digital knowledge repositories. Third, as there is often an overwhelming volume of information available on digital knowledge repositories, many people tend to use them in an instrumental manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093650211433825">Lee &amp; Thomas, 2008</xref>). In fact, an important motivation for people to use digital knowledge repositories is to find information quickly without the time and geographical constraints and to reduce the social costs associated with direct person-to-person information seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211433825">Fulk, Heino, Flanagin, Monge, &amp; Bar, 2004</xref>). Thus compared with face-to-face information seeking, users of digital knowledge repositories are more likely to overlook the authorship of information published therein and decrease the likelihood of accurately identifying the expertise level of knowledge providers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this study found a conditional benefit of using digital knowledge repositories. While the use of digital knowledge repositories alone did not help group members become more accurate in identifying “who knows what,” it moderated the negative influence of work remoteness on members’ accuracy in expertise recognition. Despite all the potential negative features of digital knowledge repositories discussed above, such systems would still provide at least some useful information regarding others’ expertise. For group members working virtually, the digital repository may become their sole or primary information source to access expertise cues. Thus, while the work remoteness creates hurdles for members to perceive each other’s expertise face-to-face, these hurdles could be alleviated by seeking and using expertise cues available on digital knowledge repositories. The findings of this study suggest that the benefits of using digital knowledge repositories can be maximized when group members are working remotely, whereas the disadvantages and drawbacks associated with such systems have a stronger impact on those members who work least remotely.</p>

<title>Theoretical and Practical Implications</title>
<p>This study advances transactive memory theory by providing an integrated examination on the development of accurate expertise recognition that cuts across multiple structural, temporal, and spatial dimensions. Addressing previous concerns that prior transactive memory research focused more on the outcomes than the antecedents of transactive memory development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211433825">Littlepage et al., 2008</xref>), this study has explained how the communication network, technology, and virtuality mechanisms lead to group members’ accuracy (or lack thereof) in expertise recognition. As these mechanisms characterize how collaborative work gets done in today’s workplace, this study helps adapt and generalize transactive memory theory to studying the emerging trends in naturally occurring and diversified organizational settings.</p>
<p>An important implication of this study is that expertise recognition is fundamentally a communicative process and should be further examined from a network perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093650211433825">Monge &amp; Contractor, 2003</xref>). Specifically, transactive memory research should take into account the emerging structures of group members’ communication network and their central positions in the network because the communication network could exert a stronger influence on transactive memory development than formal organizational structures and work processes. Furthermore, the moderating effects of using digital knowledge repositories found in this study demonstrate the importance of using a contextual and nuanced approach to fully understand the effects of knowledge management tools on organizational knowledge management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650211433825">Bock, Rajiv, &amp; Qian, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In previous transactive memory research, a considerable number of studies were conducted on ad hoc groups that were formed in lab settings to perform made-up task assignments. Thus there is an increasing demand for research on how transactive memory develops in intact work groups that perform real tasks in natural organizational settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211433825">Austin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650211433825">Faraj &amp; Sproull, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211433825">Lewis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211433825">Littlepage et al., 2008</xref>). When studying ad hoc groups formed in lab settings, researchers often find it difficult to simulate group conditions and work-related knowledge domains in which members can make actual inferences about each other’s expertise in real workplaces. In addition, the lack of naturally emergent communication networks and absence of prior work experiences would make it almost impossible to explore how network centralities in the group influence the expertise-recognition processes. This study has overcome these weaknesses by studying how group members in continuous and intact work groups recognize each other’s expertise in real work-related knowledge domains.</p>
<p>One of the practical implications of this study is that individual employees vary in their ability to accurately recognize what each other knows. To help employees better identify “who knows what” internally, organizations should encourage and promote interpersonal interactions such as face-to-face meetings, brainstorming sessions, and work-related discussions. In addition, organizations should endorse knowledge exchange within the group and provide incentives to motivate employees to share individually held information. More importantly, organizations should use a smart management of employees’ communication networks by organizing social events and regulating the appropriate use of social media in the workplace.</p>
<p>Finally, organizations should be mindful of the negative impacts of virtual work on group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition. In organizations where a virtual form of working or telecommuting is inevitable, employees should use digital knowledge repositories to overcome the obstacles of geographical dispersion. To fully realize the benefits of digital knowledge management tools, organizations should create and maintain a frequently updated system where members can retrieve accurate information about their coworkers’ areas of responsibilities and expertise. However, as revealed in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0093650211433825">Yuan et al., 2005</xref>), the difficulty in using digital knowledge repositories would prevent people from seeking information from the technological systems. Thus, organizations should make digital knowledge repositories as user friendly as possible and provide adequate training and technical support to the users. In fact, in recent years, organizations have started to implement effective knowledge management tools such as digital knowledge maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211433825">Schreiber &amp; Engelmann, 2010</xref>) and CI-KNOW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211433825">Contractor, 2009</xref>). These technological developments hold a lot of promises for facilitating group members’ accurate identification and recognition of each other’s expertise.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>This study examines only a handful of factors that could influence group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition. While these factors are deduced from transactive memory theory and directly related to group members’ multidimensional access to expertise cues, they are not adequate to capture the entire dynamics of intragroup or intraorganizational expertise-recognition processes. There exist other variables that may provide meaningful explanations for the development, or lack thereof, of group members’ accurate perceptions of others’ expertise. These factors could be related to personal and psychological attributes such as individual’s aptitude in learning about others’ expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093650211433825">Novak, 2010</xref>), emotional intelligence that could lead to a higher level of sensitivity to expertise cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093650211433825">Lopes, Salovey, &amp; Straus, 2003</xref>), and the degree to which the expert is talkative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093650211433825">Littlepage &amp; Mueller, 1997</xref>). At the group and organizational level, members working on interdependent tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0093650211433825">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>) and with external incentives to learn others’ knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093650211433825">Hollingshead, 2001</xref>) may become more accurate in perceiving each other’s knowledge. Although group size was a control variable in the current study,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0093650211433825">3</xref></sup> previous literature suggests a potential negative influence of large group size on expertise recognition because people have cognitive limits in learning and remembering expertise cues about a large number of members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093650211433825">Littlepage &amp; Silbiger, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The intrinsic nature of a knowledge domain may also influence people’s recognition of others’ expertise in that particular domain. A wealth of literature has examined the effects of knowledge characteristics such as knowledge tacitness and explicitness on organizational knowledge learning and transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0093650211433825">Su &amp; Contractor, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0093650211433825">Szulanski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0093650211433825">Zander &amp; Kogut, 1995</xref>). While tacit knowledge is deeply embedded in the context and personal experiences through which it is gained, explicit knowledge can be easily encoded in written forms and highly transferrable from person to person. Thus, group members may find it easier, and consequently become more accurate, when identifying another member’s expertise in an explicit rather than tacit knowledge domain. Therefore, future research should continue to explore a broader range of factors that could influence group members’ accuracy in expertise recognition.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this research is that it did not study the outcomes of accuracy in expertise recognition. Simply being able to accurately identify “who knows what” does not guarantee learning expertise from the experts, nor does it translate into improved performance automatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211433825">Haas &amp; Hansen, 2007</xref>). In addition, this study measured accuracy in expertise recognition in its optimal distribution within the group: complete accuracy in expertise recognition (i.e., all group members hold accurate perceptions about the knowledge of all other group members). In reality, however, groups may still function well when members possess partial accuracy in expertise recognition, that is, only a subset of members are accurate in expertise recognition or group members are accurate in perceiving the knowledge of only a subset of others. Partial accuracy in expertise recognition may be more efficient than complete accuracy when groups are large in size, have an uneven distribution of job responsibilities and task interdependence, and with some members peripherally involved in task assignments. As this study does not focus on the outcomes of expertise recognition, future research should conduct a thorough theoretical and empirical investigation into when partial accuracy is equally or more desirable than complete accuracy in expertise recognition within organizational work groups.</p>
<p>Finally, the outcome variable of this study, accuracy in expertise recognition, was measured by the similarity level between a member’s ratings of other members’ knowledge and other members’ self-reported knowledge. The validity of this measure relies on the assumption that an individual is able to accurately evaluate one’s own knowledge and truthfully reports what she or he knows. In practice, group members may not always be accurate about what they know and may overestimate or underestimate their own levels of expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211433825">Hollingshead, 2000</xref>). To address this concern, some research measures accuracy in expertise recognition by using the correlation between a member’s rating of another member’s knowledge and that member’s actual performance in the relevant work tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211433825">Littlepage et al., 1997</xref>). As this study did not collect data on individual performance in the work group, it was not possible to use this alternative means of measuring accuracy in expertise recognition. However, further research is needed to refine the measurement of this important variable by using both subjective and objective approaches.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the emerging knowledge economy, researchers and practitioners have embraced the notion of “knowledge as competitive advantage” that drives an organization’s profits, creativity, and sustainable growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0093650211433825">Stewart, 2001</xref>). The variability in people’s ability to accurately recognize each other’s expertise has inspired researchers to examine the mechanisms that could lead to the enhancement or impediment of organizational members’ accuracy in expertise recognition. As demonstrated in this study, people could become more accurate in perceiving others’ knowledge when they are centrally situated in the communication network and when they use digital knowledge repositories while working remotely. As organizational work gets increasingly complex and interdependent, there is reason to believe that even the ability to accurately recognize others’ knowledge can become a competitive advantage itself. Therefore, to better understand how individual knowledge can be recognized and used in today’s organizations, there is a demand for more creative approaches to studying work group members’ expertise-recognition processes.</p>

<p>Social network analysis differentiates two types of degree centralities: <italic>in-degree</italic> and <italic>out-degree</italic> centrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211433825">Freeman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0093650211433825">Wasserman &amp; Faust, 1994</xref>). The in-degree centrality is measured based on incoming relational ties from others to the ego, and the out-degree centrality is measured based on the outgoing relational ties from the ego to others. This study believes that both incoming and outgoing communication relationships would influence the ego’s expertise recognition processes, and thus it uses a nondirectional approach to conceptualizing and measuring the degree centrality in a group member’s communication network.</p>

<label>2.</label>
<p>In social network analysis, there are three primary measures of an individual’s centralities in the network: degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211433825">Freeman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0093650211433825">Wasserman &amp; Faust, 1994</xref>). The <italic>closeness centrality</italic> measures the degree to which the ego is connected with every other individual in the network within the shortest number of linkages. This study chose not to examine the closeness centrality for two reasons. First, there is no appropriate theoretical rationale for explaining the direct effects of closeness centrality on accuracy in expertise recognition. Second, the variation of closeness centralities in the data collected for this study was not significant enough for making rigorous statistical inferences. A similar approach was taken by previous research on the effects of network centralities on organizational turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211433825">Feeley et al., 2008</xref>) and group performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0093650211433825">Xia et al., 2009</xref>). Both studies chose to examine only parts instead of all measures of the three network centralities.</p>

<p>As a control variable, group size had no significant influence on accurate expertise recognition in this study (β = −.013, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). In a follow-up regression analysis where group size was entered as a predictor variable, its effect was still insignificant (β = −.005, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). In addition, the correlation coefficient between group size and accuracy in expertise recognition was also insignificant (<italic>r</italic> = −.005, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). These results showed that there was no significant effect of group size on accuracy in expertise recognition, which might be attributable to the small group sizes and low variance in group size among all groups in this study (<italic>M</italic> = 13.144, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.31, range = 5-20).</p>
