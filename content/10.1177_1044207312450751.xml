<abstract>
<p>Keith Storey outlined a comprehensive overview examining the pros and cons of Special Olympics and the unintended negative consequences for participants. In conclusion, he briefly summarized three options on how to respond to Special Olympics: (a) make no change, (b) reform the current structure but keep the basic conditions of Special Olympics, or (c) discontinue or replace Special Olympics with programs designed to promote more inclusive recreational leisure situations. The purpose of this article is to employ Habermas’s theory of communicative action relative to the issues and concerns outlined by Storey into this framework to increase the understanding of the Special Olympics as a movement and a system. Newly gained insights from this investigation reveal a conceptual/philosophical disconnect between (a) the Special Olympics as a meritocratic deficit-based system according to the 1960s Liberal Egalitarian lifeworld view of people with disabilities and (b) the current lifeworld view of empowerment for persons with disabilities as promoted by researchers, scholars, and educators needed to achieve socially valuable lifestyles (social justice). The Special Olympics’ antiquated deficit lifeworld view has largely resulted in outdated program practices that run counter to the current empowered lifeworld view of integrated recreational living.</p>

<title>1960s Model of Liberal Egalitarian Equity</title>
<p>Whether knowledge and truth claims about the human condition or human experience can be examined and explored effectively in meaningful ways (apart from historical conditioning) may be open to question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1044207312450751">Guess, 1987</xref>), but important insights can arguably be gained whenever historical perspectives and contexts become the vantage from which interpretations and analyses are conducted and completed. Accordingly, the emergence and advancement of Special Olympics as a movement and organization cannot be fully achieved without examining the historical context and the social structures, beliefs, and practices that have developed within the field of disability studies, recreation, education, and social services.</p>
<p>Prior to the 1960s, people with disabilities had historically endured persecution, alienation, and victimization by people without disabilities. In the United States alone, individuals with disabilities were subjected to forced sterilization and institutionalization during the Eugenics Movement throughout the first-half of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1044207312450751">Kevles, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1044207312450751">Kliewer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1044207312450751">Selden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1044207312450751">Trent, 1994</xref>), among other persecutions and marginalization (the social process of being relegated to the fringe of society).</p>
<p>The decades of the 1940s and 1950s following World War II marked unprecedented economic growth and material gain for many mainstream Americans, generating widespread optimism about prosperity that brought new hope to marginalized groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1044207312450751">Oakes, 1993</xref>). A shift away from custodial care of individuals with disabilities toward an emphasis on educational opportunities and services demanded by parents occupying the growing middle classes (and higher) emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1044207312450751">Kliewer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1044207312450751">Kliewer &amp; Drake, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1044207312450751">Shapiro, 1994</xref>). Moreover, noted prominent and wealthy families such as the Kennedys, who had relatives with disabilities, began to speak out publicly in support of people with disabilities. In an article that appeared in the <italic>Saturday Evening Post</italic> in September <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1044207312450751">1962</xref>, Eunice Kennedy Shriver recalled,<disp-quote>
<p>I remember well one state institution we visited several years ago. There was an overpowering smell of urine from clothes and from the floors. I remember the retarded patients with nothing to do, standing, staring, grotesque—like misshapen statues. I recall other institutions where several thousand adults and children were housed in bleak, overcrowded wards of 100 or more, living out their lives on a dead-end street, unloved, unwanted, some of them strapped in chairs like criminals (p. 72).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the stigmatizing effects of inferiority and deficit constructs went unchallenged, the inhumane treatment of individuals with disabilities commonly experienced in state institutions, as described above, was scrutinized and widely condemned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1044207312450751">Kliewer &amp; Drake, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1044207312450751">Noll &amp; Trent, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1044207312450751">Trent, 1994</xref>). From this history of oppression emerged the Liberal Egalitarians (like Eunice Kennedy Shriver), who, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1044207312450751">Howe (1997)</xref>, sympathized with those considered least advantaged and unequally prepared to prosper from educational opportunity.</p>
<p>Within the liberal–democratic tradition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1044207312450751">Howe (1997)</xref> explained how equality of educational opportunity in public education is largely influenced by school purpose and the underlying assumptions about justice according to three predominant theories of justice: Libertarianism, Utilitarianism, and Liberal Egalitarianism. Libertarianism frames equal educational opportunity around the premise that all individuals should have the right to pursue education in the way they so choose. Libertarians base their view of education on free market principles and individual educational merit (meritocracy) but do not insist on equal results for all. Accordingly, there is no special sympathy for the unfortunate (e.g., high poverty), but proponents of this view believe that undesirable conditions can be overcome by hard work, ambition, and persistence.</p>
<p>Unlike Libertarianism, the notion that the government should distribute resources according to perceived merit (economically valued skills) to achieve desired outcomes is the central aim of Utilitarianism. According to Howe, the meritocratic assumption that social distinctions should be made to best serve national economic productivity for the common good is a Utilitarian theory of justice. The meritocratic Utilitarian view of justice was arguably the underlying philosophical framework used to envision the education report, “A Nation at Risk” (1983), “No Child Left Behind” (2001) legislation, and, most recently, the “Race to the Top” (2009) competitive grants. In each of these instances, the desire to equalize opportunity is often positioned in conflict with, or held hostage by, the competing goal to maximize productivity.</p>
<p>In contrast to Libertarian and Utilitarian frameworks of justice, Liberal Egalitarianism, as noted by Howe, is best distinguished in terms of its conception of distributive justice. Liberal Egalitarianism identifies individuals deemed as disadvantaged based on their limited access to, and possession of, essential goods and services needed to maximize life outcomes. In an effort to remedy disadvantage and resulting disparities, Liberal Egalitarians create educational opportunity, social programs, and economic incentives to help compensate individuals for their disadvantage by creating a fair distribution of resources.</p>
<p>Liberal Egalitarian policy makers and government officials during the Civil Rights Movement designed strong compensatory educational policies and interventions. Increased public concern regarding the educational opportunities and outcomes for students with varying socioeconomic, racial, and special needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1044207312450751">Berube, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1044207312450751">Howe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1044207312450751">Rawls, 1971</xref>) resulted in the <italic>Equity Movement</italic> led by the Liberal Egalitarians. This movement sought to bolster advantages for those thought to be at risk of failure or developmentally behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1044207312450751">Coleman, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1044207312450751">Evans, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1044207312450751">Greenberg, 1969/1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1044207312450751">Horowitz &amp; Paden, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1044207312450751">Hurn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1044207312450751">Zigler &amp; Anderson, 1979</xref>). This movement included a wide variety of social and educational initiatives such as Head Start, Upward Bound, Title I, Bilingual Education Act of 1968, the Education of All Handicapped Children’s Act of 1975, and the Special Olympics. As a systemic response to social issues, the <italic>Equity Movement</italic> was a “central part of the ferment for social justice that defined the political and cultural climate of that decade” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1044207312450751">Bastian, Fruchter, Gittell, Greer, &amp; Haskins, 1993</xref>, p. 72). It is this viewpoint that fueled and justified the development, marketing, and promotion of the Special Olympics.</p>

<title>Special Olympics: Achieving Meritocratic Inclusion</title>
<p>A meritocratic society claims to place great emphasis on equal opportunity and assumes that eventual attainment of status is increasingly dependent on the individual’s ability and effort rather than inherited privilege. Functional theory incorporates the ideas and values of a meritocratic society in its optimistic interpretation that views schools as agencies whose main purpose is the sorting and selection of the most talented individuals determined to be the most capable of performing at high-status levels in school and, later, in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1044207312450751">Hurn, 1993</xref>). In this sense, special education and programs such as the Special Olympics identify individuals as disadvantaged according to the meritocratic medical (deficit) model that interprets and operationalizes any disability as “an inability to do something that most people with typical maturation, opportunity, or instruction can do” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1044207312450751">Kauffman &amp; Hallahan, 2005</xref>, p. 30). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1044207312450751">Sailor (2008–2009)</xref>, “disability” is the “extreme manifestation of the medical logic.” Personal characteristics related to “quasi-disease states” (i.e., disability categories) and measurable deviations from established norms are used to justify placement in specialized programs and settings. At the extreme extent of this deficit view of disability, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey (2008)</xref>, is a bias or preconception that researchers refer to as “handicappism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1044207312450751">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1044207312450751">Bogdan &amp; Knoll, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1044207312450751">Smart, 2001</xref>). That is, owing to the individual’s deficit, unequal and unjust treatment may be warranted and justified according to disability assumptions.</p>
<p>Deficit assumptions according to the values, traditions, and beliefs about people with disabilities in the 1960s translated into “special” activities and settings for “special” individuals who were not considered or treated as “equal” participants or community members. Faulting the Liberal Egalitarians for making decisions in the absence of research evidence that did not exist in the 1960s seems arguably unfair. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1044207312450751">Trent (1994)</xref>, Eunice Kennedy Shriver lamented her family’s frustrations in 1962:<disp-quote>
<p>To our surprise and consternation we found out that most doctors and scientists, like the general public, considered mental retardation a hopeless field for research. Established research scientists saw little connection between their studies and mental retardation . . . The public and the governments they support are slowly awakening to the needs of the retarded. Yet, even today, less is being done at the community level than for any other afflicted group (p. 74).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although it was not the conscious intent of the Special Olympics to promote a meritocratic deficit interpretation of disability, such a perspective was manifest in the overall structure and philosophy of the event.</p>
<p>The first Special Olympics was held in Chicago in 1968. At the time, the conventional wisdom was that people with intellectual disabilities could not benefit from participation in sports. Eunice Kennedy Shriver and others challenged that presumption and advocated that individuals with intellectual disabilities were far more capable in sports and physical activities than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1044207312450751">Legg, Emes, Stewart, &amp; Steadward, 2004</xref>). As an early pioneer, the Special Olympics was designed to dispel the widely held belief that people with intellectual disabilities were incapable of gaining any benefit from active sports participation. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1044207312450751">Special Olympics, Inc. (2009)</xref>, the organization’s stated mission since 1968 has always been<disp-quote>
<p>to provide year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills, and friendship with families, other Special Olympics athletes, and the community. (as cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1044207312450751">Hughes &amp; McDonald, 2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Since its inception, the Special Olympics has endeavored to promote the full participation of all individuals with intellectual disabilities, irrespective of their needs and challenges, across a variety of summer and winter sporting events. Such participation has involved systematic and supported training and competition and was designed to enhance an individual’s physical fitness, self-concept, psychological well-being, and overall social and personal competency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1044207312450751">Weiss &amp; Diamond, 2005</xref>). Today, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1044207312450751">Special Olympics, Inc. (2009)</xref> report that it has become an international program with more than 3.1 million athletes in nearly 200 countries (as cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1044207312450751">MacLean, 2008</xref>) with a longevity spanning more than 40 years.</p>
<p>Over the years, a number of researchers have examined the effects of the Special Olympics and suggested several benefits. These include improved self-concept and perceived physical competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1044207312450751">Castagno, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1044207312450751">Ninot, Bilard, &amp; Delignieres, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1044207312450751">Weiss &amp; Bebko, 2008</xref>), enhanced communication skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1044207312450751">Lord &amp; Lord, 2000</xref>), perceived social competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1044207312450751">Weiss, Diamond, Denmark, &amp; Lovald, 2003</xref>), the provision of medical and health care services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1044207312450751">MacLean, 2008</xref>), and reduced parental stress and perception of children’s skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1044207312450751">Weiss &amp; Diamond, 2005</xref>), among other outcomes. It is safe to say that the public perception of the Special Olympics is generally one that is accepted and positive. Nevertheless, despite such benefits, several researchers have also critically examined the Special Olympics from an organizational and outcomes-based focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1044207312450751">Block &amp; Moon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1044207312450751">MacLean, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1044207312450751">Ninot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1044207312450751">Storey, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>At the end of this era of activism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1044207312450751">Bastian et al. (1993)</xref> argued that compensatory programs only achieved “a shift from exclusive meritocracy to inclusive meritocracy” (p. 76). That is, although compensatory programs like the Special Olympics created new positive settings and activities to bring people with and without disabilities together, these programs succeeded only in creating new social contexts based on merited need (inclusive meritocracy) and resulted in special (segregated) activities deemed appropriate according to inability/disability assumptions. At the same time, these same marginalized groups (people with disabilities) continued to be excluded from other social (heterogeneous social networks), educational (inclusive classrooms), and economic opportunities (exclusive meritocracy) provided to advantaged groups, which was based on their perceived merit (presumed ability). In this sense, while inclusive meritocracy was conceded, exclusive meritocracy in the form of segregated settings (and activities) persisted, and as a result, unequal opportunities and life outcomes ultimately prevailed. Researchers and scholars now question whether Liberal Egalitarian programs like the Special Olympics have only perpetuated inequality by continuing to convince the same groups of learners of their inferiority or lack of merit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1044207312450751">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1044207312450751">Bogdan &amp; Knoll, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1044207312450751">Orelove &amp; Moon, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1044207312450751">Smart, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In a detailed, comprehensive review of Special Olympics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey (2008)</xref> discussed several compelling issues (past and present) regarding the Special Olympics: (a) its purpose and function, (b) traditional practices, and (c) recreational and life outcomes for individuals with disabilities. Concerns and criticisms surrounding Special Olympics discussed by Storey included (a) the advantages and disadvantages of segregated versus integrated recreational activities; (b) potential negative assumptions and stereotypes transferred to individuals with severe disabilities; (c) function, purpose, and age appropriateness of events and games; (d) financial concerns and allocation of tax dollars; (e) promoted paternalistic relationships between volunteers and athletic participants; (f) the need for current research in disability studies to increase the use of evidence-based practice; and (g) maintenance of a two-class system based on notions of “handicappism” (the practice of promoting unequal or unjust treatment of groups based on assumed disability). In his conclusion, Storey challenged the reader to consider whether Special Olympics should continue, be reformed, or completely replaced with integrated recreational services.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to employ Habermas’s theory of communicative action framework, relative to the issues and concerns outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey (2008)</xref>, to increase our understanding of the Special Olympics as a movement and a system. This examination enables us to consider (a) the past and present lifeworld views of people with disabilities, (b) the systemic activities and experiences developed to satisfy the Special Olympics’ system rationale to increase recreational activities for individuals with disabilities according to the 1960s Liberal Egalitarian meritocratic medical (deficit) model lifeworld view of disability and its consequences for people with disabilities, (c) steering media and mechanisms used to maintain and sustain the Special Olympics as a viable system for people with disabilities, (d) the continued colonization of the meritocratic deficit lifeworld view of disability (and subsequent deficit-based activities and segregated settings that result) that appears to be out of sync with current lifeworld thinking, (e) the need to expand communicative actors’ stock of lifeworldly knowledge to conceptualize and embrace the current lifeworld view of empowerment, and, last, (f) whether the Special Olympics has a future role in the current disability movement to promote social justice for marginalized groups through full participation as valued community members within integrated recreational activities and settings.</p>

<title>Habermas’s Theory of Communicative Action: Understanding the Special Olympics</title>
<p>Jürgen Habermas is a German sociologist and philosopher in the tradition of critical theory and pragmatism (the philosophical tradition centered on linking practice and theory). Acknowledging the critical role of individual agency, Habermas has emerged as an international proponent and champion of individual empowerment and deliberative democracy.</p>
<p>From Habermas’s perspective, individuals are empowered when knowledge production and claims are legitimated through communicative action. Habermas’s theory has been used to reveal, understand, and improve on doctor–patient communication in general medical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1044207312450751">Barry, Stevenson, Britten, Barber, &amp; Bradley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1044207312450751">Clark &amp; Mishler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1044207312450751">Coyle, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1044207312450751">Frank, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1044207312450751">Porter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1044207312450751">Scambler, 1987</xref>), and to enhance administrative practice in corporate management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1044207312450751">Alvesson &amp; Willmott, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1044207312450751">Forester, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1044207312450751">1989</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1044207312450751">Sergiovanni (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1044207312450751">Counsell (2007)</xref> used Habermas’s theoretical framework to examine how public schools’ lifeworlds are colonized by system protocols and policies like state-mandated testing within cultures of high-stakes testing and the impact on school character, authentic leadership, and effective schooling.</p>
<p>Throughout this article, all social actors involved in, and contributing to, communicative action relevant to the Special Olympics enterprise are denoted as communicative actors. Framing our examination from the perspective of the different communicative actors helps to focus specifically on how communicative actors’ choices and actions during Special Olympics events and activities are collectively regulated and sanctioned by the system imperatives that likewise contribute to, and promote, the different identities (roles) involved in the Special Olympics. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1044207312450751">Deetz (1992)</xref> stressed, “it is not how people use language to accomplish goals as much as how language constitutes the identity of groups and their relations that is of greatest significance” (p. 15). Identifying everyone as communicative actors allows for comparisons to determine whether there are notable differences in opportunities to participate in communicative action and how differences in communicative action contribute to system outcomes for different actors.</p>

<title>Special Olympics: A Compensatory System Response to Lifeworld Deficit Beliefs</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1044207312450751">Habermas (1987)</xref> conceptualized modern society as comprising lifeworlds and systems. The lifeworld is conceptualized as the collective consciousness (i.e., values, attitudes, beliefs, assumptions, and convictions) used by communicative actors to make sense of their world. Habermas envisioned communicative action as the “acts of reaching understanding” (p. 5) to attain cooperation and group consensus among social participants. All societal enterprises (such as the Special Olympics) use communicative action (symbolically mediated interaction) primarily expressed through speech acts “in a cooperative process of interpretation” as communicative actors “relate simultaneously to something in objective, social, and subjective worlds” (p. 120).</p>
<p>Systems are highly organized, rationalized social mechanisms comprising management designs and protocols, strategic and tactical actions, policies and procedures, as well as efficiency and accountability assurances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1044207312450751">Sergiovanni, 2000</xref>). Systems are created to support and promote lifeworld beliefs and achieve desired outcomes for communicative actors. The Special Olympics’ early momentum positioned it as a formidable force in the field of outdoor recreation for persons with disabilities nationwide. As a system, the Special Olympics developed essential steering media and mechanisms to effectively advance and support the specially designed recreational experiences and activities that were needed (system rationale) and deemed appropriate for individuals with disabilities, hence, a compensatory system response to the Liberal Egalitarian lifeworld view of deficit and the absence of recreational opportunities.</p>
<p>Early attempts to develop appropriate instruction and learning activities for individuals with severe disabilities (much like the activities developed for Special Olympics) were based largely on developmental levels attributed to behavioral characteristics. Less than a decade later, however, the seminal work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1044207312450751">L. Brown, Nietupski, and Hamre-Nietupski (1976)</xref> established the foundation for the next generation of curriculum and instructional design that shifted the focus from behavioral characteristics to “ultimate functioning” so that individuals with severe disabilities could participate as productive members of their communities—an approach that dominated the 1980s in public schools. In the 1990s to the present, there has been a curricular shift that has advocated for the full participation of learners with severe disabilities in general education classrooms, and integrated work and residential programs. Moreover, general education researchers now recognize the advantages to connecting factual knowledge to real-life applications for all learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1044207312450751">Brady, 2000</xref>). The challenge for researchers and practitioners, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1044207312450751">Dymond and Orelove (2001)</xref>, is to balance academic, functional, and social skills according to the participants’ individual needs in ways that are meaningful and purposeful to their lives.</p>
<p>In spite of Special Olympics’ optimistic view to increase recreational opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities, the games and activities that prevailed have failed to maximize recreational and life outcomes that can only be achieved through varied, diverse, and inclusive opportunities and settings. For example, the learning and developmental benefits of activities such as the softball throw event (participants throwing a softball aimed at a spot on the ground), as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey (2008)</xref>, has little functional value as an isolated skill completed apart from the social game of softball. Similarly, International Olympians may participate in track and field events like the javelin, shot put, and high jump, which also have limited learning and developmental value as the softball throw event. However, individuals with severe disabilities (unlike Olympians) have unique considerations that require a balanced approach to maximize overall physical, developmental, functional, and social outcomes that must be decided on an individual basis.</p>
<p>Other Special Olympics booths and games (e.g., clown toss, ring toss, a golf activity using plastic clubs), as suggested by Storey, also offer little developmental value beyond eye–hand coordination and limited motor development. Emphasizing these same eye–hand coordination skills within athletic games such as frisbee golf or putt-putt golf and using actual equipment would not only serve to increase the physical–motor aspect of the required skills but would likewise enhance the social, communication, and cognitive aspects naturally inherent in team sports. Participants’ ability to take turns, share, understand multiple perspectives, negotiate, and problem solve during sports events becomes the important foundation for essential life skills that further aid individuals’ ability to understand and make sense of their world across different social contexts in which they live, play, work, and function.</p>
<p>Of particular urgency is the persistent segregated nature of the Special Olympics that has irked numerous critics over the last two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1044207312450751">Bersani, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1044207312450751">Block &amp; Moon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1044207312450751">Hourcade, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1044207312450751">Orelove, Wehman, &amp; Wood, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, the need to provide all participants with opportunities to engage in integrated activities with typical peers has yet to be included in the mission statement. Admittedly, Special Olympics has made efforts to promote integration at least at some level—specifically, Unified Sports Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1044207312450751">Hughes &amp; McDonald, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1044207312450751">MacLean, 2008</xref>) and Sports Partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1044207312450751">Block &amp; Moon, 1992</xref>)—but it remains ostensibly a segregated activity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1044207312450751">Foote and Collins (2011)</xref> defend the Special Olympics’ segregationalist bias by asserting that its role is not really to promote inclusion but to provide opportunities for “sports training and competition” (p. 5), and that participants should be allowed to choose any activity they want. Indeed, Foote and Collins note that the “the Special Olympics never set itself up as an organization solely focused on integration and it has remained true to its mission from the start” (p. 5). This failure continues despite international and current educational and social support policies committed to promoting full community acceptance and inclusion for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1044207312450751">Brown, Schalock, Percy, &amp; Rioux, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the segregationalist nature of the Special Olympics is defended on the basis that segregated recreation is better than no recreation at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1044207312450751">Hughes &amp; McDonald, 2008</xref>). This may be true—there are few integrated recreational opportunities available in this country—but is this really a choice situation? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1044207312450751">Ward (2005)</xref> suggested, choice requires a minimum of three desirable options. In terms of the Special Olympics, we only have segregated recreation or no recreation.</p>
<p>Today, researchers and educators like Storey have come to understand that maximizing learning and developmental outcomes for all communicative actors depends largely on members’ unrestricted access to people and activities across a variety of social settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1044207312450751">D. M. Mank &amp; Buckley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1044207312450751">Storey, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1044207312450751">Will, 1984</xref>). Diversifying group participants across the full range of development, skills, and abilities during educational, recreational, and functional routine-based activities broadens the span of development and performance experienced. This results in more varied learning opportunities for all participants than could otherwise be achieved in self-contained, homogeneous, segregated group arrangements or settings. Maximizing the continuum of experiences maximizes the outcome potential for <italic>all</italic> participants. To limit or restrict access to a full range of experiences within socially integrated settings would thus limit learning and life outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1044207312450751">Counsell, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1044207312450751">Ninot et al. (2005)</xref> examined whether individuals with intellectual disabilities, who participated in a segregated versus integrated athletic program perceived their physical (athletic) competence differently. The results indicated that students in the integrated program had significantly lower athletic competence scores than those in the segregated program. At face value, this suggests an advantage of segregated programs. However, as Ninot et al. noted, students placed in segregated environments and programs have a general tendency to overestimate their perceived competence because they are restricted to comparing themselves with other peers with disabilities; as such, this often results in an inaccurate perception. In contrast, comparisons with nonintellectually disabled students will produce a more realistic evaluation of their skills.</p>
<p>Ninot et al. suggested that when students are informed about their “real” capacity, this will motivate them to participate in more athletic activities in the future. In a sense, the Special Olympics backed itself into a similar conundrum. The studies that have examined Special Olympians’ perceptions of their self-worth have generally reported positive results. But in all of these investigations, except for Ninot et al.’s study, the samples were restricted to students in segregated programs that only allowed students to compare themselves with other students with disabilities. Although positive self-perceptions are to be appreciated (especially from a population that has historically been so marginalized), these studies expose the unrealistic and separate contexts in which the Special Olympics operate.</p>

<title>Special Olympics’ Monetary and Legal Steering Mechanisms</title>
<p>In modern capitalist society, monetary and legal steering mechanisms are the two most powerful media used to advance lifeworld views and sustain systems as essential to the lives of communicative actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1044207312450751">Habermas, 1987</xref>). In combination, these two media make any transformation of lifeworld views and systems a daunting task. The Special Olympics has recruited and fully utilized legal and monetary steering mechanisms needed for long-term sustainability and longevity that in turn have served to help dominate and control the field of recreation for individuals with disabilities in general. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1044207312450751">Gotz (1997)</xref>, money, data, and political influence frequently become the mechanisms by which the rationalized system exercises direction and ultimate control of lifeworlds.</p>
<p>Legislation such as the Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act of 2004 (HR5131) has been an important legal mechanism for securing the Special Olympics’ access to federal grants. Other federal legislation such as the Special Olympics’ own funding category within the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services has proved to be a particularly powerful and effective steering mechanism, ensuring noncompetitive funding, with clear and unchallenged advantage over other recreational programs and services.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey (2008)</xref> explained how the Special Olympics funding is secured by recruiting fiscal support from individuals, corporate contributions, and federal grants. Capitalizing on Liberal Egalitarianism, the Special Olympics provide wealthy individuals, corporations, and the federal government with an important venue for proclaiming their outward support for improving the lives of individuals with disabilities. Storey’s reference to advertisements recruiting corporate sponsorship illustrates the use of support for a charity cause to improve public visibility and enhance corporate image worldwide while convincing the middle class that this is a maximum recreational experience for this group of people. Yet, corporations have no commitment or obligation to hire individuals with cognitive disabilities, an initiative that would provide concrete hope for greater prosperity and civic participation. Although the Special Olympics spends hundreds of thousands of dollars with private marketing firms (communication media) to promote the Special Olympics on a national and international scale, they fail to capitalize on opportunities to utilize money sources in ways that would benefit Special Olympics athletes beyond their participation in sports events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Ending Colonization: Expanding Communicative Actors’ Stock of Lifeworldly Knowledge</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1044207312450751">Habermas (1987)</xref> speculated that when “media-controlled subsystems of the economy and the state intervene with monetary and bureaucratic means in the symbolic reproduction of the lifeworld, a colonization of the lifeworld can result” (p. 356). When lifeworlds are colonized, systems no longer support or advance lifeworld beliefs, values, or traditions of groups of communicative actors, institutions, or organizations. Instead, the system rationale overwhelms the lifeworld view, subverting the lifeworld view with the system rationale.</p>
<p>In 1968, the Special Olympics’ intent at the outset was never to challenge, question, or confront the Liberal Egalitarian’s meritocratic deficit lifeworld view of disability that dominated that era. In this sense, the Special Olympics did not colonize the lifeworld view of disability but rather, fully accepted and promoted that lifeworld view as its own. However, the Special Olympics’ longevity, public approval, and international growth have served to further solidify this deficit view of disability as the dominant, most pervasive lifeworld view today, colonizing new generations of communicative actors’ worldview of disability into this lifeworld belief.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1044207312450751">Habermas (1987)</xref>, culture refers to the stock of knowledge that communicative actors use to interpret and make sense of their world. By inserting every present experience into the flow of lived experience, communicative actors’ individual stock of lifeworldly knowledge based on situational experiences emerges. Communicative actors’ lifeworld views are directly influenced and informed by the individual stock of lifeworldly knowledge that is accumulated and integrated over time. Changing or transforming lifeworld views requires new life experiences that expand on and transform the ongoing, ever-changing stock of lifeworldly knowledge in ways that empower communicative actors to examine, question, and challenge current lifeworld beliefs, traditions, and subsequent daily practice.</p>
<p>The Special Olympics as a system developed an elaborate and complex infrastructure with employed and nonemployed communicative actors working to provide sports and recreation experiences for people with disabilities. Paid communicative actors (bureaucrats and personnel) recruit and train voluntary communicative actors (huggers, coaches, and corporate sponsors) according to Special Olympics protocols, policies, and procedures to help operate recreational events and activities in specified ways for athletic participants.</p>
<p>In the absence of fair and equal representation as viable communicative actors, this deficit system relinquishes individuals with disabilities (and their families) to having little or no opportunity for authentic, informal choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1044207312450751">Callahan &amp; Mank, 1998</xref>) or full participation in decision-making activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey, 2008</xref>), and precludes the opportunity for self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207312450751">Agran, King-Sears, Wehmeyer, &amp; Copeland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1044207312450751">Wehmeyer et al., 2007</xref>). A system that overemphasizes deficit is invariably contingent on maintaining a two-class worldview (normal vs. disabled) and subsequent “inferiors” and “superiors” status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1044207312450751">Orelove &amp; Moon, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1044207312450751">Sailor, 2008–2009</xref>). Relegating athletic participants into the subservient role as “inferiors” who must rely on the more able, capable adults to provide opportunities to them compromises life opportunities and outcomes for Special Olympic participants in contrast to other communicative actors.</p>
<sec id="section7-1044207312450751">
<title>Infantilization</title>
<p>The term <italic>infantilization</italic> refers to treatment that denies individuals adult status, dignity, and rights as citizens. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey (2008)</xref>, infantilization robs individuals of the most basic human right—individual dignity. As the deficit view promotes (intentionally or not) infantilization of the marginalized group, it simultaneously casts the decision makers (bureaucrats and volunteers) in a paternalistic role. Coaches are persons without disabilities who serve in an authoritative capacity, rendering people with disabilities as compliant and obedient to the coach’s will and direction, regardless of the coach’s age or professional status with respect to the athlete. Infantilization was further evident to Storey when he noted that only 1 of the 36 members of the 2008 Special Olympics International Board was actually diagnosed as having a disability, indicating that the paternalistic decision makers who disseminated programs and services to the Special Olympics’ participants were predominantly people without disabilities.</p>
<p>As a means to show social approval and provide physical reinforcement, the Special Olympics promote frequent hugging. Although hugging is a socially accepted behavior within the context of a recreational or sporting event, the extent to which it is used in the Special Olympics has met with some criticism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1044207312450751">Foote &amp; Collins, 2011</xref>). Such criticism is not based on the action per se as much as its excessive frequency of occurrence. Another concern raised is that huggers of all ages and backgrounds—generally, volunteers—may infantilize adult athletes by hugging them like children rather than celebrating adult athletes’ accomplishments in such ways as shaking an athlete’s hand, high-fiving, or congratulating them with a pat on the back. Hugging is a practice undergirded by assumptions and beliefs based on “handicappism,” “infantilization,” and “paternalism.” Critics like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1044207312450751">Bowles and Gintis (1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1044207312450751">1989)</xref> have long charged Liberal Egalitarianism as oppressive, paternalistic, and undemocratic due largely to the lack of opportunity to share little or no input from the individuals who are most affected by the chosen practices. Congratulatory gestures such as “pats on behinds” or “chest banging” would not be recommended for use in diverse events and settings as well, as these gestures may be deemed inappropriate or insensitive, depending on participants’ age, gender, or culture.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey (2008)</xref> further argued that adult participants are often perceived as children (infantilized) because “both children and adults compete in the same events” (p. 136). Storey cited several examples in which athletes of varied ages competed in the same event. A primary and critical assumption made for all educational, community, and social services is that activities and events will be age appropriate. The Special Olympics must also follow this practice.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey (2008)</xref> provided examples of high-profile individuals who publicly expressed a limited, if not skewed, view of people with disabilities based on their stock of lifeworldly knowledge concerning the Special Olympics. He cited President Barack Obama’s (March 19, 2009) informal comment on the <italic>Tonight Show</italic> with Jay Leno in which President Obama referenced his own bowling skills suggesting, “It was like the Special Olympics or something.” In response to President Obama’s comment, U.S. Representative Patrick J. Kennedy (Eunice Shriver’s nephew) suggested the most appropriate apology would be “to go to a Special Olympics event and be a hugger.” During a Special Olympics Global Law Enforcement Torch Run Ceremony (July 6, 2007) at the White House (demonstrating Special Olympics’ full utilization of the communication network media at the highest pinnacle of public life in the United States), President George W. Bush made references to being a “hugger” while he was the Governor of Texas that drew laughter from the audience.</p>
<p>President Obama, as a communicative actor, expressed his own deficit view of his bowling skills when he framed his bowling ability (or inability) within the context of Special Olympics. By comparing his skills with Special Olympics, Obama suggested his deficit bowling skills were like that of Special Olympic bowlers and athletes. Patrick Kennedy’s response that the president should become a Special Olympics hugger indicated that although Kennedy recognized the deficit assumption implied by the President, as a communicative actor who had extensive experiences and close ties to Eunice Kennedy Shriver, he failed to acknowledge how those same deficit views are actually emulated by Special Olympics, in all, suggesting that the Special Olympics is part of the problem and not the solution. Liberal Egalitarians have been criticized for failing to attend to and acknowledge how class membership underpins privilege and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1044207312450751">Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1044207312450751">1989</xref>) and is dominated by economically powerful White males. The liberal quest for equality serves only to maintain the status quo, rendering White males the standard of comparison while disempowered groups (like people with disabilities) must relinquish to prescribed rules and activities they did not help formulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1044207312450751">Howe, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Although deficit-based practices such as the employment of “huggers” at the Special Olympics have profound consequences for the participating athletes, there are serious consequences for the “huggers” themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey (2008)</xref> noted several research studies in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1044207312450751">Burns, Storey, &amp; Certo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1044207312450751">Roper, 1990a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1044207312450751">1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1044207312450751">Storey, Stern, &amp; Parker, 1990</xref>) that demonstrated nondisabled participants’ lifeworld view of disability remained unchanged (colonized by the system rationale) even after participating in the Special Olympics. Not only does this practice result in compromised self-worth for the athletes, but it compromises the volunteers’ views of the athletes as well. It is the underlying “sympathetic, altruistic human impulse” implied by the “special” designation in Special Olympics (or special education), as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1044207312450751">Sailor (2008–2009)</xref>, which creates a sympathetic motive (by volunteers toward inferior, subservient athletes).</p>

<title>Advancing change</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1044207312450751">Wagner and Kegan (2006)</xref> insisted that attempts to reform systems like the Special Olympics typically result in only modest, incremental change, a view shared by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey (2008)</xref> and others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1044207312450751">DiLeo, 2007</xref>). Similar to the Special Olympics debate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1044207312450751">Sailor (2008–2009)</xref> frustrated by our failure to more fully integrate students with disabilities, questioned current educational placement and asked whether schools should “continue to tinker around the edges of a clearly broken system or . . . rethink the whole enterprise” (p. 250). Only reinvention, Wagner and Kegan argued, can lead to adaptive change for the self (the individual communicative actor). Inward and outward reflection, combined with multiple lived experiences with different recreational activities, programs, practices, services, and settings, can satisfactorily transform communicative actors’ stock of lifeworldly knowledge. As Storey pointed out, recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1044207312450751">Butterworth, Fesco, &amp; Ma, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1044207312450751">D. Mank, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1044207312450751">Rogan, Banks, &amp; Howard, 2000</xref>) indicates that when provided with options and allowed to make choices, people with intellectual disabilities will choose multiple alternatives over segregated options. Even when other agencies and organizations have been surveyed to explore perceptions of the Special Olympics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1044207312450751">Porretta, Gillespie, &amp; Jansma, 1996</xref>), overall respondent results suggested a need to change the Special Olympics’ mission toward a greater emphasis on integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1044207312450751">Dattilo, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Possible resistance to change could emerge from well-compensated communicative actors employed by the Special Olympics. Monetary steering mechanisms such as generous benefits and travel packages, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1044207312450751">Storey (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">2008)</xref>, creates a vested interest and commitment on the part of paid communicative actors toward continuing to advance and sustain the Special Olympics’ status quo. Any subsequent changes require strategically positioned communicative actors (such as legislators, business leaders, human activists, and researchers) to employ money and legal media strategically to reenvision the system rationale and steering mechanisms according to current lifeworld thinking. The reinvented system would then legally mandate bureaucrats to participate and support the delegated changes accordingly.</p>
<p>In the end, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey (2008)</xref> challenged the Special Olympics’ lifeworld view of deficit as dated, if not objectionable, in light of what researchers, scholars, and educators now know, understand, and value about disabilities. Current delivery systems now focus on empowering individuals with intellectual disabilities needed to lead socially valued lifestyles (and achieve social justice) through community integration, social relationships, skill development, choice, and self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1044207312450751">Browder, Cooper, &amp; Lim, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1044207312450751">Felce &amp; Perry, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1044207312450751">Hughes &amp; McDonald, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1044207312450751">Modell &amp; Valdez, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1044207312450751">Wehmeyer et al., 2007</xref>).

<title>Reenvisioned Lifeworld Leads to Reinvented Systems</title>
<p>The Special Olympics’ attempt to create recreational opportunities for individuals with disabilities must be understood, valued, and appreciated within its respective historical context. Lifestyles perceived as “socially valuable” (social justice) for persons with disabilities were directly limited and hindered by the lowered lifeworld beliefs, assumptions, and expectations of that era. Subsequent practice was formulated and implemented without the benefit of research in its earliest stages. The Special Olympics’ widespread acceptance with little or no substantial scrutiny has resulted in the embracement of an unchallenged deficit lifeworld view of disability (and subsequent systemic programs and rationale). The Special Olympics as a contemporary system must now be held accountable for the practices and services it continues to promote in light of accumulated research.</p>
<p>Employing Habermasian fieldwork, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1044207312450751">Forester (1992)</xref>, enables scholars to “explore the continuing performance and practical accomplishment of relations of power” (p. 62). The point of this analysis, according to Forester, is not to expect an idealized truth telling (a common misinterpretation of Habermas). The purpose, instead, is to “look at concrete communicative practices to determine the kinds of differences they can and do make” (p. 62). In this article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1044207312450751">Habermas’s (1987)</xref> theory of communicative action explored the unresolved disconnect between (a) the 1960s Liberal Egalitarian lifeworld view of disability, based on the meritocratic medical (deficit) model that seeks to provide compensatory opportunities for individuals with disabilities so that they may experience the pleasures of sports, recreation, and physical fitness, albeit in a segregated delivery system and (b) an empowered lifeworld view of disability that seeks to achieve socially valued lifestyles (social justice) for individuals with severe disabilities using interest-based integrated recreational programs and services.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, using Habermas’s theoretical framework helped us to effectively employ lifeworld and system perspectives to reveal how a system and rationale designed to achieve one lifeworld view will ultimately fail to achieve a new lifeworld view without first reinventing the system, its rationale, and subsequent steering mechanisms. In the case of Special Olympics, the Liberal Egalitarian lifeworld deficit view of disability led to meritocratic sorting and grouping people with disabilities into compensatory programs based on, and justified by, ability/disability assumptions that resulted in handicappism, paternalism, and infantilization effects for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The Special Olympics’ antiquated lifeworld view of people with disabilities has largely resulted in outdated program practices supported by steering mechanisms that, altogether, run counter to today’s emerging proactive lifeworld view of empowerment. Only one program within the Special Olympics systemic organization, the Unified Sports Program, has successfully moved beyond the Liberal Egalitarian deficit worldview of disability to create opportunities for people with and without disabilities to participate together within integrated sports events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1044207312450751">MacLean, 2008</xref>). The Unified Sports Program fosters integration by matching athletes with and without disabilities (based on age and ability) to train and compete together, intended for athletes to mutually support and encourage one another. However, relatively few of the total number of Special Olympians participate in the Unified Sports Program, and the availability and promotion of Unified Sports are location specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1044207312450751">Storey, 2008</xref>). In addition, the Unified Sports Program is geared toward “higher ability athletes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1044207312450751">Special Olympics, Inc., 2009</xref>) that precludes it from being considered a viable recreational option for individuals with more extensive support needs.</p>
<p>Local communities also have a variety of recreational programs that may be appropriate for individuals with intellectual disabilities (e.g., YMCA, Little League, Youth Soccer Leagues; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1044207312450751">Hughes &amp; McDonald, 2008</xref>). That said, successful participation is of course contingent on the availability and efficient delivery of necessary supports and adaptations, so such programs are location specific and their impact in promoting integrated recreational options remains uncertain. In all, a great opportunity presents itself for the Special Olympics to show its leadership skills by assisting such programs.</p>
<p>Subsequent systems will find it essential to include practices and activities designed to increase education, professional development, and training that will help transform communicative actors’ ongoing stock of lifeworldly knowledge needed to understand, value, appreciate, and fully embrace a new lifeworld view of empowerment for everyone regardless of varying ability. Steering mechanisms based on communication, law, and money (like those utilized by the Special Olympics) are needed to help establish and maintain the new system’s sustainability, growth, and outcome achievements that reflect socially valued lifestyles for everyone. Reinventing the Special Olympics with current values that promote inclusion, empowerment, community membership, and maximum life outcomes may not only achieve the values stated in its original mission, but it will also provide a future direction for other educational and community programs to follow.</p>
