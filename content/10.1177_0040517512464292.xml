<p>The aim of this study is preparation and characterization of diclofenac sodium microparticles and their application to the orthopedic support materials. The microparticles were obtained using spray drying method involving ethyl cellulose as shell material. The morphology, particle size, drug loading capacity and in vitro release characteristics of the drug microparticles were optimized for impregnation diclofenac sodium microparticles onto the orthopedic support materials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the drug microparticles and the treated fabrics with microparticles. SEM images illustrated that the microparticles were spherical in shape and also fixed onto the orthopedic support materials. Furthermore, the resistance of materials containing microparticles to washing were also investigated. Finally, <italic>in vitro</italic> drug release studies of microparticles and textile impregnated with microparticles were done. This study suggested that textile systems containing diclofenac sodium microparticles could have a potential for long-term therapy for rheumatic disorders.</p>

<body>
<p>In recent years, functional textiles used in medical and related healthcare have become an important and rapidly growing segment of the textile field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512464292">1</xref></sup> The textile industry, together with medical knowledge, has paved the way for enriching the use of textile fabrics because of their interaction with the skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512464292">2</xref></sup> Textile materials have found uses in the medical field, for example as artificial aortas and bandages. However, advanced functional textile drug delivery systems were not developed until the end of the last millennium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512464292">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Orthopedic support materials are used for protection and as support joints in various zones of the body. General examples of such applications are knee supports, wrist supports, ankle supports, elbow supports, shoulder supports and back supports. These supports are used for cure or protection. Medical applications usually happen in the areas listed below:
<list id="list1-0040517512464292" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>after operation or traumatic irritations;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>in joint illnesses that are degenerative and inflammatory;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>over-forced ligaments and tendons;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>special problems of various joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512464292">4</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDSs), in comparison to conventional pharmaceutical dosage forms, offer many advantages, including improved systemic bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients, fewer administration frequency, longer duration of therapeutic action, reduction of side effects, steady drug delivery profile, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512464292">5</xref></sup> Several technologies have been developed and used in preparing TDDSs, and one of these is the use of medicated textiles for delivering drugs to specific body sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512464292">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, microencapsulation has become an active field in textile science research as patent applications are increasing. The major interest in the microencapsulation process is currently in the application of durable fragrances, phase-change materials, dyes, fire retardants, counterfeiting and antimicrobial agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512464292">7</xref></sup> This technique can also be used as an encapsulation method when it entraps active material within a protective matrix, which is essentially inert to the material being encapsulated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512464292">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Polymers are frequently used in microencapsulation studies. Ethylcellulose is a water-insoluble polymer widely used in oral and topical pharmaceutical formulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512464292">9</xref></sup> It is especially used to prepare sustained-release medications of various types. In the absence of polymer swelling ability, ethylcellulose becomes a key factor in such systems, because release kinetics would depend largely on the porosity of the hydrophobic compact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512464292">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Spray-drying encapsulation, which was used particularly for the preparation of microparticulate drug delivery systems, has a number of advantages. It is a well-established technology, involving readily available equipment and comparatively low-cost encapsulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512464292">11</xref></sup> This technique transforms liquid feed into dry powder in one step, which is feasible for the scaling-up of the microencapsulation, continuous particle processing operation and can be used for a wide variety of materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512464292">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diclofenac sodium (DS), a sodium salt of 2-[(2,6- dichlorophenyl)aminophenyl]-acetic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512464292">Figure 1</xref>), is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), commonly used for the long-term treatment of rheumatic disorders, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritic and ankylosing spondylitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512464292">13</xref></sup> Several unwanted adverse effects are generally associated with the long-term oral administration of NSAIDs, including stomach ulcerations, abdominal burning, pain, cramping, nausea, gastritis and even serious gastrointestinal bleeding and liver toxicity. The DS is completely absorbed following oral administration, but its elimination half-life is relatively short (1–2 h). Due to its biopharmaceutical and pharmacological properties, sustained-release formulations of DS are desirable that should maximize therapeutic benefit and reduce the unwanted side effects, since the frequency of administration is lower, improving the therapeutic efficacy and patients’ compliance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512464292">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512464292"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512464292"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512464292"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512464292"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512464292">19</xref></sup>

<p>The aim of this study is the preparation and characterization of DS microparticles and their application to orthopedic support materials. The microparticles were obtained using the spray-drying method involving ethyl cellulose as a matrix material to control drug release. The morphology and particle size of the drug microparticles were optimized for impregnation of DS microparticles onto the orthopedic support materials. Finally, in vitro drug-release studies of microparticles and textile impregnated with microparticles were done.</p>

<p>DS (CAS Number: 15307-79-6), acquired from Amoli Organics, India, was the active material used. Aqueous formulations based on ethyl cellulose (Surelease® E-7-19040, fully plasticized aqueous ethylcellulose dispersion with 25% (w/w) solid content, Colorcon, England) were used as controlled release polymeric system. The polymers were blended with the excipients propylene glycol (Sigma, USA), as a plastifying agent, colloidal silicon dioxide (Cab-O-Sil® M5, Cabot Corp., Germany), as a glidant, and distilled water.</p>
<p>A textile fabric composed of wool, acrylic, polyester and elastane was used as orthopedic support material, supplied by Interfarma (Turkey). For the impregnation of the textile fabrics with microparticles using the foulard, the aqueous bath was prepared by adding microparticles and nano-dispersion of a polyether polyurethane self-cross-linking agent (Baypret Nano-PU, Tanatex Chemicals, the Netherlands). The mentioned nanodispersed polyether polyurethane was obtained by dispersing to a particle size of less than 100 nm The general properties of this agent are amphoteric/anionic, yellowish liquid, 1.10 g/cm<sup>3</sup> density, 50 mPas viscosity, pH 4.5–5.5 at 20℃ and miscible in water.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512464292">20</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec4-0040517512464292"><title>Preparation of microparticles</title>
<p>The microencapsulating runs were carried out in a bench-top spray dryer model SD-04 (Lab-Plant, North Yorkshire, England), with concurrent flow regime. Aqueous dispersion of ethyl cellulose (Surelease®) was used as controlled release polymeric system. DS and the polymer dispersion were suspended in distilled water. The drug:polymer ratios in the microencapsulating compositions were maintained at 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4 (dry base). Propylene glycol at concentrations of 0.6% and 0.75% w/w of colloidal silicon dioxide were then added to the drug/polymer suspension and maintained under agitation for 30 min. The starting compositions of formulations in spray drying are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517512464292">Table 1</xref>. The resulting compositions were then fed to the spray dryer under the following conditions: feed flow rate of the microencapsulating composition, <italic>Ws</italic>, 10 g/min; inlet air temperature, <italic>Tai</italic>, 125℃ and outlet air temperature <italic>Tao</italic>, 60–66℃. Samples of the spray-dried microparticles were collected during the experiments. Microparticles prepared were subjected to physical and chemical characterization.

<sec id="sec5-0040517512464292"><title>Characterization of the microparticles</title>
<p>The effects of spray-drying conditions and composition of the microencapsulating formulation on physical and chemical properties of DS microparticles were assessed by determining drug content and encapsulation efficiency, particle size and size distributions, particle morphology, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD) analysis.</p>
<sec id="sec6-0040517512464292"><title>Drug content and encapsulation efficiency</title>
<p>The DS content of microparticles was determined spectrophotometrically. Phosphate buffer solution (5 ml; pH 7.4) was added on 20 mg of microparticles and shaken for 23 h. Then, 5 ml of buffer solution was added and it was shaken for another 1 h. After filtration, 0.1 ml of filtrate was diluted to 10 ml with buffer solution. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 276 nm by a spectrophotometer against the blank, and drug concentration was determined from the calibration curve (<italic>n</italic> = 5). Encapsulation efficiency for each formulation was determined by using following equation:

<p>The air permeability test is one of the major properties of textile materials and is governed by factors such as the fabric structure, density, thickness, surface characteristics, etc. The air permeability test was performed to determine the effect of microparticles on the air permeability properties of textile materials. The air permeability results of textile materials impregnated with microparticles is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517512464292">Table 4</xref>. According to the results, the air permeability value of the textile impregnated with microparticles was slightly decreased. This was because the microparticles fill in the space between fibers. When concentrations of microparticles and the cross-linker on orthopedic support material are kept constant, the air permeability values of the orthopedic support material impregnated with microparticles are not expected to change. This is also confirmed with the air permeability results given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517512464292">Table 4</xref>. There is no significant difference between the air permeability values of the textile materials impregnated with microparticles prepared in different drug:polymer ratios. However, due to the fact that cross-linking material forms cross-links and that it is a nano-sized coating material, the air permeability values were observed to decline when compared with values of untreated orthopedic support material.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512464292">Figure 9</xref> shows the amount of drug released from microparticle formulations. In vitro release study of the microparticles showed that the time for 100% DS release was extended to 90, 120 and 150 min for 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4 microparticle formulations, respectively, when compared to 60 min for pure DS. The results indicate that increasing the polymer ratio decreased the release rate. In the drug-release medium, all microparticle formulations showed an initial fast release due to the dissolution of the drug from the surface, but the release of the drug was extended up to 150 min depending on the polymer ratio. As more drug is released from the microparticles, more channels are probably produced, contributing to faster drug-release rates. In addition, higher drug levels in the microparticle formulation produced a higher drug concentration gradient between the microparticles and drug-release medium; thus, the drug-release rate was increased.

<p>The results of the in vitro release of textile impregnated with microparticles with different drug:polymer ratios in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solutions at 37℃ are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517512464292">Figure 10</xref>. It can be seen that at the beginning of the drug-release study, for all formulations, a larger amount of DS was freed from the surface of the textile (about 60–90%). This fast release may be attributed to the small size of the microparticles (8.44–9.68 µm) and the vast surface area and amorphous characteristics of drug. Amorphous drugs have different physiochemical properties and are more soluble than the crystalline drugs<sup>28</sup>. Therefore, fast dissolution of the encapsulated drug could take place immediately when the drug particle was exposed to the aqueous environment. A burst effect was exhibited in all drug-release profiles at the first hour<sup>6</sup>. Since DS is soluble in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution, the burst effect is probably caused by the fast dissolution of the drugs located close to the surface of the microparticles. The dissolution of the surface drug will result in channels, allowing the aqueous medium to penetrate into the matrix, leading to drug dissolution and subsequent drug release via the medium-filled channels. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that a significant loading of drug is located in the vicinity of the microparticle surface, and this is released as the cavity size increases.

</fig></p>
<p>After 1 hour, there was a steady release of drug into the release medium for all formulations. When we compare the formulations with each other, the drug-release ratio was higher in 1:1 than in 1:2 and 1:4 in the first three hours (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for each point) Drug release was completed in the third hour in formulation 1:1 and was completed in the fifth hour in formulation 1:2.

As a result, it can be implied that the increase of drug loading caused a more rapid drug release. Polymer concentration and drug-release behavior were directly proportional.

<p>In this study, DS microparticles were successfully prepared using a spray-drying method that included aqueous dispersion of ethyl cellulose. Morphology, size and size distribution, FT-IR spectroscopy, DSC, X-ray studies on microparticles and laundering behavior of microparticles from textiles were assessed. Microparticles were seen to be spherical and smooth in structure, with a mean diameter in the range of 8.44–9.68 µm. The amorphous nature of entrapped DS in microparticles was confirmed by the DSC and XRD studies.</p>
<p>The microparticles were applied in the finishing process of textile fabrication using a foulard, in which the textile to be treated is impregnated using a finishing bath containing (i) microparticles and (ii) a self-cross-linking agent. The surface morphology of microparticles has been studied by means of SEM. It can be observed that microparticles containing DS remain on the orthopedic support material after 10 and 20 washing cycles. The difference between the air permeability values of the textile materials impregnated with microparticles prepared in different drug:polymer ratios was observed to be not significant. According to the in vitro release studies, the increase of drug loading caused a more rapid drug release, and polymer concentration/drug-release behavior were directly proportional.</p>
<p>The orthopedic textile material prepared by our system could be developed further into a medical textile that has the potential to provide a TDDS after many launderings.</p>
