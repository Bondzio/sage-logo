<p>This Special Issue of <italic>Media, War &amp; Conflict</italic> is devoted to an exploration of ‘Terrorism in “old” and “new” media’. The articles included here were originally prepared for a conference on ‘Terrorism and New Media: Building a Research Network’ hosted by the School of Law and Government and the Centre for International Studies at Dublin City University on 8–9 September 2010. The purpose of the conference was to bring together academics from a broad range of disciplines with policy-makers and security practitioners in order to facilitate advances in the study of terrorism and ‘new’ media, particularly the internet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750635211434349">1</xref></sup> The importance of ‘old’ media—newspapers, radio, television—to terrorism should not be underestimated, however, hence the mention of ‘old’ media in the title of our Special Issue and its coverage in a number of its articles.</p>
<p>In fact, the Special Issue’s opening article is chiefly concerned with ‘old’ media, comparing and contrasting the US press coverage accorded to female terrorist plotter, Colleen LaRose, with that of two male terrorist plotters in order to test whether assertions in the academic literature regarding media treatment of women terrorists stand up to empirical scrutiny. The findings confirm that women involved in terrorism receive significantly more press coverage and are framed vastly differently in the US press from their male counterparts. This article resides within a significant body of research on terrorism and media that analyses print media, particularly newspapers, and the framing of terrorism therein. The second article in this Special Issue, while also concerned with the US press, departs from this tradition by soliciting ‘front-line’ reporters’ personal opinions and insider knowledge of the interplay of terrorist goals with resulting media coverage, the decline of traditional journalism and how new media technologies are affecting journalistic routines. Whilst these journalists represent ‘old’ media, Epkins finds their increasing dependency upon ‘new’ media and related technologies, along with the impact of altered routines post-9/11, has led to increased autonomy for these ‘gatekeepers’ in their reporting on terrorism.</p>
<p>Following on from Epkins’s analysis of the operations of ‘old’ media in the ‘new’ media age is O’Mahony and Fair’s contribution, which also has ‘old’ and ‘new’ media components. Prince Johnson and Joshua Blahyi are both former Liberian warlords well known for both their political violence activity and embrace of media. Warlordism is not usually considered within the domain of terrorism; however, O’Mahony and Fair show that Johnson and Blahyi’s civil war communication strategies had the express purpose of inspiring terror in their opponents and the general populace. In addition to employing home video, newspaper coverage, book publishing, documentary film and other media forms to forward their goals, Johnson and Blahyi have most recently exploited online social media to simultaneously acknowledge and self-reframe their violent past lives with a view to ensuring that their past behaviour does not become a contemporary political liability.</p>
<p>Whilst the Special Issue’s opening article is concerned with the portrayal of female terrorists in the US press, gender issues are also treated in Benjamin Ducol’s article on the French-language ‘jihadisphere’, in which women have played prominent roles. The expanding provision of violent jihadi content in continental European languages, such as French, German and Dutch, has recently been commented upon by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750635211434349">EUROPOL (2011)</xref>, but has not yet been adequately examined in the academic literature. Ducol’s article, which includes a description and discussion of the major websites and forums composing the French-speaking jihadisphere, the real and virtual links between these, and how forum users originally learned of the forums’ existence, seeks to begin to remedy this omission.</p>
<p>Although Ducol’s analysis is not of a localized conflict per se, it is localized to some degree in terms of his focus on the French-speaking jihadisphere. Bowman-Grieve and Conway’s article, on the other hand, is concerned with the internet’s role in a considerably more localized sphere: the continuing conflict in Northern Ireland. Similar to Ducol, their article is an exploratory analysis, in this instance of the contours and functions of violent dissident Irish Republicans’ online discourses. The article argues that Republican online forums have an important support function in terms of providing an ‘always-on’ space for discussion, consumption and production of Irish Republicanism and thus a potentially educative role in terms of introducing the uninitiated to violent dissident Republicanism while also acting as a ‘maintenance’ space for those already committed in their beliefs. Like Ducol, the authors also raise questions about the links between online activity and ‘real world’ activism for which there are still no satisfactory answers.</p>
<p>In terms of the overall contribution of this Special Issue, then, we hope it encourages readers to think more deeply about the intersections between ‘old’ and ‘new’ media, particularly with respect to terrorism. In a similar vein, we would like to encourage the continued widening of the field of terrorism and media research to include the whole of the contemporary mediascape, not just newspapers and the internet, but also film, television drama, computer games and graphic novels, as well as other media forms. A comment with regard to research into terrorism and the internet, in particular: future research in this area should expand to consider the online strategies of political violence actors beyond violent jihadis, to include violent separatist groups, the extreme Right, etc. and to make comparative analyses of these organizations.</p>
<p>Lastly, our conference and subsequent network-building would not have been possible without the generous support of the Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS), the Office of the Vice-President for Research (OVPR) at Dublin City University, the British International Studies Association (BISA), the Center on Public Diplomacy at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School, the School of Law &amp; Government at Dublin City University and Fáilte Ireland. Our deepest appreciation too to Professor Philip Seib for his continued support and his offer of guest editorship of this Special Issue of <italic>Media, War &amp; Conflict</italic>; also to Ben O’Loughlin and all those who reviewed papers for this issue; and Arlene Luck and the staff at Annenberg Press.</p>
