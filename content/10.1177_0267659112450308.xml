<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>Hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with increased fluid filtration, edema formation and, occasionally, organ dysfunction. Cold-induced reduction in endothelial barrier function may play a role. β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic activation elevates cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which maintains endothelial barrier properties.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the widespread application and improvements of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in cardiac surgery, its use is believed to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, related to biochemical as well as physiological changes. Among the potentially harmful effects of CPB is the accumulation of fluid in different tissues and organs, with edema formation occasionally leading to postoperative vital organ dysfunction, affecting the heart, lungs and gastrointestinal organs. Whereas crystalloid hemodilution with a decrease in the plasma oncotic pressure early after the initiation of CPB is partly responsible for the temporary increase in fluid filtration during the first 30 min of CPB,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112450308">1</xref></sup> a general inflammatory response secondary to the activation of cells and cascade reactions initiated by contact between the blood and the foreign surfaces of the CPB circuit, contributes to fluid and protein extravasation, especially in the post-CPB period and probably less during CPB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112450308">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have, in a number of studies, presented evidence for an increase of fluid extravasation that results in elevated tissue water content of different organs when cardiopulmonary bypass is performed under hypothermic (28°C) or tepid conditions (33-34°C).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112450308">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112450308"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112450308">5</xref></sup> The mechanisms behind this cold-induced increase in fluid filtration are still debated and not fully understood.</p>
<p>Endothelial cells provide a selective barrier between the vascular system and the interstitial space and control the movement of water, proteins and solutes across the blood vessel walls. Breakdown of the endothelial barrier due to inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112450308">6</xref></sup> or hypothermia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112450308">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112450308">8</xref></sup> is characterized by the formation of intercellular gaps, with an increase in vascular leakage, and edema formation, which may impair the microcirculation.</p>
<p>It is well established that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) has barrier stabilizing properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112450308">9</xref></sup> Recent data show that cAMP-increasing agents, such as isoprenaline and terbutaline, stabilize the endothelial barrier via activation of Rac 1, a GTPase which appears to regulate a diverse array of cellular events, including cell-to-cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112450308">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that activation of the β-adrenoreceptor-cAMP pathway could contribute to reduced capillary permeability, with a possible beneficial effect on fluid extravasation during hypothermic CPB. We administered terbutaline, a selective β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptor agonist, as a continuous infusion prior to and during CPB.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-0267659112450308">
<title>Animal handling and anesthesia</title>
<p>We studied 14 immature domestic pigs, about 3 months old, of either sex, (Norwegian landrace Norhybrid, Stend Agricultural College, Fana, Norway). The animals were acclimatized for at least one week in our laboratory housing area prior to the experiments. The anesthetic and experimental protocol was approved by the local laboratory animal veterinarian under the surveillance of the Norwegian Animal Research Authority and the animals received humane care in compliance with the European Convention on Animal Care. Food was withdrawn 12 h prior to the study. Water was available at all times.</p>
<p>Anesthesia was carried out as previously described, with pre-anesthetic medication of ketamine 500 mg, diazepam 10 mg and atropine 1 mg given i.m.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112450308">11</xref></sup> Thirty minutes later, general anesthesia was induced via a face mask with isoflurane in oxygen. After insertion of an ear vein catheter, anesthesia was supplemented by 5 mg/kg of thiopentone i.v. before intubation of the trachea (Mallinckrodt, blue line oral tube I.D. 6.0, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). General anesthesia was maintained by volume-controlled ventilation (end tidal carbon dioxide level about 5.0 kPa) with isoflurane delivered in 50% oxygen in air and a continuous i.v. infusion of fentanyl (7.5 μg/kg/h) and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg/h), according to a previously published protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112450308">11</xref></sup> To avoid shivering during hypothermic CPB, all animals received an additional infusion of pancuronium 0.45μg/kg/h. Adjustment of the inspired isoflurane concentration was allowed in the range 0.5-2.0 vol%, according to the reactions to standardized noxious stimuli.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112450308">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the induction of anesthesia, a midline sternotomy was performed. Preparation for extracorporeal circulation was done after the i.v. administration of heparin (6 mg/kg body weight, plus 3 mg/kg after 1 hour). In parallel, arterial and venous lines for continuous monitoring of systemic arterial pressure and central venous pressure were placed in the right femoral artery plus the femoral vein and the right atrium. A urinary bladder catheter was inserted via a midline mini-laparotomy. Surgery was normally completed within 20 min. All animals were, thereafter, allowed 60 minutes stabilization before the start of CPB.</p>
<p>Blood loss was substituted by the use of acetated Ringer’s solution in volumes three times the blood loss volume. During CPB, blood loss into the open chest was returned to the circulation via the extracorporeal machine reservoir.</p>
<sec id="section8-0267659112450308">
<title>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)</title>
<p>Cannulation for CPB was established in the ascending aorta and the right atrium with a 18 F aortic arch cannula EOPA (Elongated OnePiece Arterial Cannula, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and a 32 F Single-Stage Venous Drainage Cannula (TF-032-L) RMI (Edwards Lifesciences Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) connected to standard equipment for open heart surgery. A membrane oxygenator with reservoir and integrated heat exchanger (Quadrox, hollow-fibre membrane oxygenator with heat exchanger and venous hard-shell cardiotomy reservoir, VHK 4200, Jostra AG, Hirrlingen, Germany) was used. Pump flow was set to 2.7 l/m<sup>2</sup>/min. In all groups, the CPB pump head pressures were in the range of 200-250 mmHg and non-pulsatile flow was used. In-line arterial and venous measurement of oxygen tension was performed with a pO<sub>2</sub> monitor (Terumo CDI 500 in-line Blood Parameter Monitor System, Terumo Cardiovascular System Corp., Tustin, CA, USA). During CPB, isoflurane 0.5% was added to the oxygenator. Throughout the experiments there was a constant fixed height difference (73 ± 3 cm) between the level of the venous reservoir and the site of venous drainage (the right atrium).</p>
<p>The priming volume of the CPB circuit was 1115 ml of acetated Ringer’s solution, which regularly resulted in a filling of the venous reservoir to a level of 400 ml. This level was used as a fluid gauge. Changes in this level indicated a loss or gain of fluid from the circulation to the interstitial space, bleeding, increased diuresis, perspiration or changes in vascular tone. Whenever the level of the reservoir fell, acetated Ringer’s solution was supplemented to restore the 400 ml level.</p>
<p>After stabilization for 60 minutes, normothermic CPB (38-39°C) was initiated and continued for 60 min followed by 90 min hypothermic CPB (28°C). By setting the water temperature of the CPB heater-cooler to 5°C, a drop in the core temperature from about 39 to 28°C was achieved within 15-20 min. During CPB, nasopharyngeal and rectal temperatures were measured continuously.</p>

<sec id="section9-0267659112450308">
<title>Study design and groups</title>
<p>Fourteen animals were randomized into two study groups: the terbutaline group (T-group) (n=7) and the control group (C-group) (n=7). From start of anesthesia, the T-group received a continuous infusion of terbutaline 10 μg/min (0.1 mg terbutaline/ml in glucose 50mg/ml) whereas a similar amount of glucose without terbutaline was given to the C-group. Acetated Ringer’s solution (5 ml/kg/hour) was administered as maintenance fluid throughout the experiments in both study groups.</p>
<sec id="section10-0267659112450308">
<title>Hemodynamic variables</title>
<p>Heart rate monitoring was obtained using surface ECG electrodes. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were recorded continuously, using fluid-filled catheters connected to pressure transducers (Transpac<sup>®</sup> II, Abbot Critical Care Systems, Abbot Norge AS, Fornebu, Norway) linked to a monitor (HP-78353A monitor Hewlett Packard Norge AS, Fornebu, Norway).</p>

<sec id="section11-0267659112450308">
<title>Blood analyses and colloid osmotic pressure (COP)</title>
<p>Blood samples were drawn from the arterial line for the determination of hematocrit (Hct), plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP<sub>p</sub>), serum albumin, serum total protein and serum electrolyte concentrations, as well as acid base parameters. The Hct was determined using standard hematocrit tubes centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min. Serum albumin and serum total protein concentrations were analyzed in an automatic analyzer (Technicon Chem. Systems, Bayer Corp., Pittsburg, PA, USA) by colorometry and by the biuret reaction test, respectively.</p>
<p>COP was measured in plasma and interstitial fluid with a colloid osmometer, using a semi-permeable membrane with a cut-off level at 10,000 Dalton (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) with acetated Ringer’s solution in the reference chamber. The osmometer was designed to accept 5-µl sample volumes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112450308">12</xref></sup> Pressure was measured by a pressure transducer (Gould-Statham, Spectramed Inc, Levis centre, Mount Vernon, OH, USA) connected to a recorder (Easy-Graph 240, Gould Electronics Inc., Eastlake, OH, USA).</p>
<sec id="section12-0267659112450308">
<title>Sampling of interstitial fluid</title>
<p>Fluid for the determination of interstitial colloid osmotic pressure (COP<sub>i</sub>) was sampled by means of multifilament nylon wicks (Number 18, Norsk Fletteri, Bergen, Norway). The wicks were soaked in acetated Ringer’s solution before insertion. They were sewn into lateral abdominal skin folds by means of a straight suture needle (Acufirm 214/1, Acufirm <italic>Nadel- und Kanülentechnologie</italic>, Dreieich, Germany) and placed subcutaneously in lengths of 8-10 cm. The protruding ends of the wicks were covered with an adhesive plastic film (Tegaderm, 3M Norge AS, Skjetten, Norway) to prevent fluid loss by evaporation. The wicks were left in situ for 90 min<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112450308">13</xref></sup> whereafter they were pulled out swiftly and placed under mineral oil in centrifuge tubes. Wick fluid (5-15 µl) was collected after centrifugation. Blood contamination in the wicks was judged visually when removing each wick from the animal. Only white wicks were accepted.</p>
<p>Wick fluid from three implantation periods, before, during normothermic and during hypothermic CPB, was analyzed.</p>

<title>Blood volume determination with the carbon monoxide method</title>
<p>Red blood cell volume (V<sub>RBC</sub>) and plasma volume (V<sub>P</sub>) were determined just before the start of CPB using carbon monoxide as the label.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112450308">14</xref></sup> Subsequent V<sub>RBC</sub> and V<sub>P</sub> were calculated every 30 minutes from the recorded loss of blood and the repeated determination of Hct values. To assess the the real <italic>in vivo</italic> V<sub>P</sub> of the animals during CPB, the calculated V<sub>P</sub> were corrected according to the following equation:</p>

<title>Fluid loss and supplementation, fluid extravasation</title>
<p>Urine output was recorded every half hour via a suprapubic catheter. All fluids administered to the animal were recorded, including fluid additions to the machine reservoir during CPB. Net fluid balance (NFB), i.e. all fluid additions minus diuresis and blood losses during CPB, was calculated at given time intervals.</p>
<p>NFB was used together with changes in plasma volume (ΔV<sub>P</sub>) to calculate the fluid extravasation rate (FER) (mL/kg/min) according to the formula:</p>
<p>FER (ml/kg/time interval) = NFB (ml/kg/time interval) - ΔV<sub>P</sub> (ml/kg/time interval)</p>

<sec id="section15-0267659112450308">
<title>Procedures at the end of the experiments</title>
<p>At the end of each experiment, the animals were sacrified with an IV injection of 20 ml of saturated KCl solution.</p>
<p>Immediately after killing the animals, tissue samples (3 parallel pieces) were taken simultaneously from the left quadriceps muscle, abdominal skin, colon, ileum, stomach, liver, pancreas, kidney, lung and heart. All samples were placed in pre-weighed vials, re-weighed and transferred to a drying chamber at 70°C. The following days, the vials were weighed repeatedly until stable weight. Total tissue water content (TTW) was recorded as the weight reduction in grams per gram dry weight.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0267659112450308">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) version 18.0 for Windows. The results are presented as mean ± SD. Repeated measures analysis of variance with one grouping variable was used to test the relationship of the outcome variables at different times. If a significant between-group p-value was found, post-hoc independent t-tests were performed to compare the data between the two groups. On finding a significant within-group p-value, a post-hoc paired t-test was used to compare the changes at different time intervals. The p-value was adjusted according to the number of comparisons performed. An independent t-test was used for the two-group comparison of total tissue water content in the various organs. The chosen level of significance was p-value &lt;0.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The animals of the T-group and the C-group were comparable with respect to age (80.7 ± 22.0 and 83.4 ± 8.7 days), weight (30.9 ± 4.7 and 28.6 ± 2.2 kg) and sex (male/female: 5/2 versus 4/3).</p>
<p>The body core temperature developed similarly in the two study groups. During hypothermic CPB, the temperature fell from 38.1 ± 0.8°C to 29.0 ± 0.8°C in the T-group and from 37.8 ± 1.6°C to 28.6 ± 1.3°C in the C-group. The major temperature reduction occurred within 15 min after the start of cooling, with no between-group differences (p=0.186).</p>
<p>Serum sodium and chloride concentrations, together with serum osmolality, remained stable within the normal range in both study groups throughout the experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659112450308">Table 1</xref>). Serum potassium decreased significantly in both groups during the experiments, with no between-group differences, although the values of the T-group tended to be lower at all times (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659112450308">Table 1</xref>). The pH decreased in both study groups during the experiments. The pH level of the T-group was significantly lower than that of the C-group at baseline before CPB as well as after 150 min on CPB. Base excess (BE) displayed a similar pattern, with a gradual reduction in both groups and a significantly lower value in the T-group as compared with the C-group at the end of the experiment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we evaluated the theoretical beneficial properties of a terbutaline infusion on microvascular fluid shifts during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. The study was designed to separate the effect of hemodilution from that of hypothermia, with respect to associated microvascular fluid shifts during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Hypothermia was, thereby, initiated 60 min after the start of CPB.</p>
<p>The infusion of terbutaline was given from 90 minutes before CPB and the doses were close to the maximum recommended levels in human patients during the treatment of bronchospasm and for the inhibition of preterm labour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112450308">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results confirm our previous observations with regard to the effect of hypothermia on fluid extravasation during CPB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112450308">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112450308">4</xref></sup> However, in this experimental model, we did not find any attenuating effect of terbutaline on cold-induced fluid shifts.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will elaborate on the theoretical background for the hypothesis, discuss the results and present possible explanations for the lack of effect seen in this study.</p>
<p>The passage of water and small solutes across the capillary endothelium is through intercellular clefts restricted by tight junctions (TJ) and adherence junctions (AJ). The linkage between the actin-myosin contractile machinery of the endothelial cells and the different junctions plays an important role in the regulation of the paracellular permeability. Different conditions and mediators assemble or disassemble the junctions and may, therefore, reduce or increase the permeability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112450308">16</xref></sup> Although the mechanisms are not definite, numerous studies confirm that cAMP signalling within the endothelial cells lowers paracellular permeability and protects against the loss of barrier function under various pathological conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112450308">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112450308">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112450308">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112450308"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112450308">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, β-adrenergic receptor-dependent cAMP generation was demonstrated to be crucial for the maintenance of the microvascular endothelial barrier properties both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> under baseline conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112450308">18</xref></sup> The barrier-protective properties of mediators such as ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) has, as an example, been demonstrated to depend on an increase in the level of cAMP, with subsequent inhibition of different signalling cascades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659112450308">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, reduced levels of cAMP in endothelial cells, together with Rac 1 inactivation, are key signs of endothelial barrier dysfunction during inflammation and sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112450308">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The administration of β<sub>2</sub>-agonists (terbutaline, isoprenaline) has been shown to be effective, through cAMP increase, in preventing α-thrombin-induced endothelial hyper-permeability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659112450308">20</xref></sup> Similarly, its administration contributed to lessening tissue edema and protein flux across the alveolar epithelial and pulmonary microvascular barriers during an injurious high volume ventilation modality <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659112450308">21</xref></sup> Finally, in fact, the beneficial effects of terbutaline on microvascular permeability have been utilized for decades in the treatment of idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome or to prevent recurrent episodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659112450308">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mechanisms behind endothelial hyper-permeability have been the object for thorough research for years and the topic still receives considerable attention. Hyper-permeability is a significant problem in the vascular inflammation associated with trauma, inflammation/sepsis, ischemia/reperfusion injury and adult respiratory distress syndrome. All these conditions contribute to cytoskeleton contraction, intercellular gap formation and an increase in endothelial permeability.</p>
<p>Recently, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies uncovered similar structural changes related to the loss of adherence junctions during hypothermia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112450308">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112450308">8</xref></sup> Such changes were observed early after the initiation of cooling and the increase of endothelial permeability was present already at a temperature level of 32°C, with rapid restoration of endothelial cell inte- grity upon rewarming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112450308">8</xref></sup> An increase or decrease of intercellular endothelial gaps was found to be dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK 1/2) activation, as well as connexin 43 (Cx43) expression, which were reduced during cooling, with restoration upon rewarming.</p>
<p>Based on, 1) similar structural endothelial changes following inflammatory conditions and hypothermia, and 2) the well-known barrier-protective properties of cAMP, we formed our hypothesis that the administration of terbutaline could contribute to modulate the cold-induced fluid shifts present during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.</p>
<p>The current experimental model was an <italic>in vivo</italic> system where only significant changes in fluid shifts could be detected. This was done intentionally while we primarily searched for clinically relevant effects. We are aware, however, that minor and clinically less important effects of terbutaline on fluid extravasation could have been ignored.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular responses to β-adrenergic stimulation are diminished during hypothermia. By lowering the body temperature to 24-25ºC, the hemodynamic response to isoproterenol disappeared in rats and dogs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659112450308">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267659112450308">24</xref></sup> This mechanism could, conceivably, contribute to the lack of effects by terbutaline on the cold-induced fluid extravasation rate. However, fluid extravasation was similar in the study groups, even during the initial normothermic phase of CPB.</p>
<p>The serum potassium level of the intervention group tended, at all times, to be below the values of the control group; however, with no statistical between group differences. This is most probably related to the well-known shift of potassium ions from the extracellular to the intracellular space on the administration of terbutaline. The differences in pH values are similarly related to the mechanism of K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>shifts between the intra- and extra-cellular spaces.</p>
<p>The analysis of total tissue water content of the different organs revealed no between-group differences in the heart, lungs and the major part of the gastrointestinal organs.</p>
<p>The water content, however, turned out to be significantly higher in the skeletal muscle of the T-group animals. An explanation for this could be the higher perfusion of skeletal muscles in the T-group caused by stimulation of the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptors of the arterioles, resulting in vasodilatation, increase in capillary surface area and elevated capillary hydrostatic pressure. The significantly lower tissue water content of the liver and both kidneys in the T-group is difficult to explain, but could be related to the redistribution of blood flow from abdominal organs to skeletal and myocardial muscles during the stimuli of β<sub>2</sub>-receptors.</p>
<p>The population of cardiac surgical patients has changed over the last decades, with older age and more co-morbidities and, consequently, higher risk of complications. Positive fluid balance is associated with perioperative morbidity and the further search for strategies to limit fluid accumulation is warranted and may contribute to improved outcome.</p>
