<abstract>
<p>A group lifestyle education program for overweight/obese children 6 to 15 years old and parents was adapted for the youngest age group (6-9 years) based on program evaluation. The new curriculum had parents reflect on their influence over the family health-related environment while exploring feeding and activity relationships. Children experienced self-expression through verbal, physical, and creative facets of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Six groups experienced a 2-week program (two 5-hour sessions on 2 consecutive Saturdays). Summary evaluation demonstrated significant increases in parent perceived knowledge for each subject area and a high degree of program satisfaction. One recommendation by parents was to receive this information earlier in the parenting experience.</p>

<p>Family-based interventions take advantage of parents’ role to shape family environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412438393">1</xref></sup> and are considered key in pediatric obesity treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412438393">2</xref></sup> Parents influence the child’s environment through interactions with the child and through foods purchased and made available, meal planning, preparation, scheduling, and modeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412438393">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Make It HAPPEN is a no-fee, family-based program enabling families of overweight or obese children 6 to 15 years old to improve their lifestyle behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412438393">4</xref></sup> Program evaluation revealed improvement in child body mass indices (BMI) and <italic>z</italic>-scores, as well as quality of life for both child and parent. Self-esteem improved significantly for children with initial BMI percentiles of 98 or higher.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412438393">4</xref></sup> However, for the youngest age-group (6- to 9-year-olds) qualitative feedback from evaluations, in addition to facilitator observations, suggested that classroom sessions were not age-appropriate and were too long. The decision was to shorten and adapt the scope of the program for this age-group and focus on the role of parents. This article reports results of the first 6 groups completing the new program in terms of parental satisfaction with the program and their self-assessment of change in knowledge in key content areas.</p>
<sec id="section1-1941406412438393" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The new program for the youngest age-group increased the emphasis on parenting for healthy lifestyles and had children separated from parents for discussion of parenting style, growth, weight, and lifestyles. Participants were self referred or referred by health care professionals (primarily physicians). The criterion for family participation was one or more children 6 to 9 years old above the 85th BMI percentile. The goal of the new program was to help parents understand their influence on key aspects of the family environment through exploring the family feeding and activity relationships,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412438393">5</xref></sup> and parenting styles. The facilitators, who believed that these concepts were a priority in shaping future family lifestyle behaviors, learned that these concepts were new to most parents. The program encouraged a supportive and authoritative parenting style, to encourage preferred ways of relating to children around food, feeding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412438393">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412438393">3</xref></sup> and physical activity. Objectives and key messages for parents are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1941406412438393">Table 1</xref>. The new group program was offered in two 5-hour sessions on 2 consecutive Saturdays (instead of 2 hours per week for 10 weeks). The classes for this new program were held at the children’s hospital for convenience and ready access to suitable spaces: classroom, gymnasium, and a child-life arts area.</p>

<p>The children’s curriculum, developed in consultation with child life and kinesiology staff, involved participating in active play (physically active games); creating a snack (foods from 2 to 3 food groups, such as yogurt and fruit with a small muffin) to enjoy with their parents; verbal, physical, and creative self-expression; and involvement in a family activity (often a group walk). Active play for children included fun, noncompetitive, and inclusive games to achieve a positive group environment. Delivery was standardized through use of a standard slide presentation, copresentation by 2 facilitators, and guidelines for snacks and activities. Specific areas for increased knowledge capacity for parents are identified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1941406412438393">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Program facilitators had dietetics, child life, nursing, and kinesiology backgrounds, with specific training in motivational communication strategies, behavior change, and small group facilitation. A letter was sent to the family physician (with parent permission) to report participation, describe key messages and enlist support for parents to make lifestyle changes. A program brochure was also included.</p>
<p>Evaluation was conducted to assess acceptability and success of the new program. Two questionnaires were distributed at the end of each class. The first was a 10-point Likert-type perceived knowledge scale for parents before and after the class on the key subject areas for that class. The second was a 6-point rating scale for parents to rate satisfaction with class location, format, handouts, and facilitator performance (4 questions). Questionnaires were assessed for face validity with a convenience sample (2 parents and 2 clerical staff). Staff routinely explained the questionnaires, including how to rate perceived knowledge levels. Significance testing for change in perceived knowledge levels (paired <italic>t</italic> test) and averages (weighted by class attendance) from parent satisfaction questionnaires were calculated for the first 6 groups completing the program. Team debriefing at the end of each program included review of evaluations and observations by facilitators. Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board, University of Calgary provided approval for publication of data gathered from program evaluation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Group size varied from 17 families to 8 families; a total of 71 families participated in the adapted program from September 2009 to June 2010. Attendance ranged from 15 to 5 families per class, and median attendance rate was 67% (range = 32% to 92%); a reminder protocol improved subsequent attendance. Perceived increases in parents’ knowledge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1941406412438393">Table 2</xref>) were significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Satisfaction with program structure and delivery was high (average satisfaction was 5.6/6). Based on facilitator feedback during debriefing sessions, the class exercise in self-assessment of parenting style, and discussions of goal setting and the change process were well received. Parents reported significant increases in their understanding of parental feeding and activity roles, a concept that was often new for them. The estimated cost per family for program delivery by trained staff was $220 to $250 (CAD), including administrative overhead and supplies.</p>
<p><italic>Comment</italic>: Effective child feeding requires an understanding of child developmental stages,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412438393">6</xref></sup> as well as a healthy feeding relationship marked by a division of responsibility (the parent decides what food is offered, when and where it is offered, thereby providing structure and leadership to the child around food, whereas the child is responsible for deciding if/how much to eat).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412438393">5</xref></sup> This philosophy emphasizes trust in the child’s ability to self-regulate food intake by recognizing hunger and satiety cues, within the context of regular eating patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412438393">7</xref></sup> Parental feeding practices predict parenting style; feeding interventions that fail to address underlying parenting styles are less likely to be successful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412438393">8</xref></sup> In addition to feeding, parents have a role as gatekeeper over the child’s physical activity level, determining how often opportunities for physical activity are provided,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412438393">5</xref></sup> whether screen time is limited,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412438393">9</xref></sup> as well as by parental modeling of involvement in physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412438393">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The new program for families of 6- to 9-year-olds demonstrated significant increases in perceived knowledge rating for key content areas and high satisfaction ratings by parents. A few parents suggested the program information be available to them earlier, perhaps at prenatal classes. Validated measures of knowledge and behavior change would strengthen future program evaluations.</p>
