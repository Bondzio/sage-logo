<abstract>
<p>The emergence of private sector management of state prisons over the last 30 years has been controversial. It has been strongly argued that the administration of prisons is a core state function that, morally, should not be delegated. Proponents of this view contend that the State should directly manage its prisons even if it could be demonstrated that the privately managed prisons are superior to publicly managed prisons in achieving positive correctional outcomes or having less repressive regimes or being more sensitive to human rights. Hitherto, this strongly argued moral position has not been directly tested by litigation. In the case described in this article, a challenge to the proposed privatization of an Israel prison was challenged in the Israel Supreme Court. The challenge hinged on the meaning of the Basic Law of Israel which, it was argued, created a super-legislative constitutional right for prisoners to serve their sentences under the direct management of the State. The Supreme Court upheld this argument, in effect accepting that imprisonment is a core state function. It stated that all imprisonment per se contravenes Basic Law provisions relating to life, personal liberty and human dignity. To serve a sentence in a privately managed prison would be a further contravention of the Basic Law. Accordingly, the State should have a monopoly of ‘permitted violation of human rights’.</p>
<p>The article discusses the implications of this decision both within the domestic context of Israel’s imprisonment standards and from the point of view of whether the decision has wider significance for the growth of private management of prisons in other jurisdictions.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1462474511434429"><title>Prologue: The re-emergence of prison privatization</title>
<p>In post- Civil War USA, prison privatization involved the sale of prisoners’ labour to entrepreneurs, who then would sell on their labour and/or charge their families for their subsistence. Accountability was non-existent, and standards inhuman and degrading. The practice was a blight upon penal policy and an abrogation of state responsibility for its citizens. The notion that privatization was an acceptable way of managing imprisonment became discredited.</p>
<p>It was a little surprising, therefore, that it re-emerged so strongly in the early 1980s. The broad political context was the dominant philosophy that the State was a wasteful service provider in comparison to the private sector. This view was encapsulated in the enormously influential and widely cited book <italic>Re-inventing Government</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1462474511434429">Osborne and Gaebler, 1992</xref>). The specific trigger was the difficulty that the US government was experiencing in dealing with immigration detention. Once privatization of custodial services commenced, however, standard imprisonment became the target of the companies involved. The motivation of the parties – governments and companies – was complex. These motivating factors included: exponential increases in incarcerated populations; overcrowding which in turn led to federal court orders against prison authorities; political and legal barriers against capital expenditure by states, inhibiting their ability to commit additional funds to prison infrastructure; concern about the recurrent costs; growing frustration with the perceived obstructionism of unionized labour; and some desire for regime improvement and better correctional outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1462474511434429">Harding, 2001</xref>: 269–273).</p>
<p>Privatization soon spread from the USA to other common law countries, particularly Australia and the United Kingdom. However, it was a far different model from the post-Civil War version of the ‘sale of prisoner labour’. It involved the delegation of service delivery, not the wholesale abandonment of state responsibility. This was exemplified by the fact that, in Australia and the United Kingdom, the regulatory environment created by the State was rigorous. However, regulatory oversight was much looser in the USA.</p>
<p>While the motives for privatization were complex and multi-layered, it is true to say that they involved among other things a desire to improve upon public sector systems that had sometimes become introverted and demoralized, and were focused more on inputs than outcomes (Donahue, 1989). The hope was that the private sector could bring energy and innovation to prison regimes, not merely so as to establish a prison that was ‘better’ than a comparable public sector one but also so as to bring about cross-fertilization with the public sector, gingering it up, so that the system as a whole would be improved.</p>
<p>The financial cost to the State was usually less than that of running a pub1ic sector prison; ‘getting more for less’ was avowedly an objective in most privatization exercises. However, the private operator could only stay in the field if over time it made a reasonable return on capital. This was a focal point for opponents, denigrating those who would make a profit out of imprisoning others; though these same critics seldom addressed the opportunity costs and waste involved in public sector prison regimes and practices.</p>
<p>Opinions will vary, but my own assessment both as an autonomous Inspector (and thus a key player in the regulatory system)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1462474511434429">1</xref></sup> and as a long-time student of prison regimes is that the best private prisons have had the hoped-for impact. Of course, this assessment is not universally endorsed. However, we do not need to debate this issue here. This is because the most radical opponents to prison privatization object to the policy whether private prisons turn out to be ‘better’ or not. Their stance is that, even if it could be demonstrated that private sector involvement has been correctionally beneficial, has enhanced the decency of prison regimes and has protected the human rights of prisoners, privatization is wrong. This is still the case, in their view, even if the public sector can be demonstrated to be doing an inefficient or even a repressive job.</p>
<p>For example, the distinguished Norwegian scholar, Nils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474511434429">Christie (1993</xref>: 102), has written:<disp-quote>
<p>The prison officer is my man. I would hold a hand on his key<italic> </italic>… He could be a bad officer. And I could be bad. Together we made for a bad system, so well known from the history of punishments. But I would have known I was a responsible part of the arrangement. Chances would be great that some people in the system were not only bad. They would more easily be personally mobilized. The guard was their guard, their responsibility, not an employee of a branch of General Motors, or Volvo for that matter. The communal character of punishments evaporates in the proposal for private prisons.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474511434429">DiIulio (1991</xref>: 197) has made similar arguments, broadened out into criminal justice administration generally: ‘The badge of the arresting police officer, the robes of the judge, and the state patch of the corrections officers are symbols of the inherently public nature of crime and punishment.’</p>
<p>Many other commentators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474511434429">Feeley, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474511434429">Nellis, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1462474511434429">Robbins, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1462474511434429">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474511434429">Ryan and Ward, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1462474511434429">Shichor, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474511434429">Sparks, 1994</xref>) have developed aspects of these arguments. For them privatization of prisons is an abandonment of a <italic>core state function</italic> and responsibility. According to this approach, any purported delegation of this <italic>core state function</italic> is always politically, morally and philosophically wrong. The privatization of any aspect of the State’s sovereign powers can never be defensible and, arguably, is constitutionally illegitimate.</p>
<p>This fundamental argument had not previously been made, even in the USA where litigation involving the activities of private prison operators has been extensive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1462474511434429">2</xref></sup> It was raised before the Constitutional Court in Costa Rica but dismissed on the facts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1462474511434429">3</xref></sup> The comprehensive challenge that was brought in the Israel Supreme Court, sitting as the High Court of Justice was almost certainly the first of its kind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1462474511434429">4</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1462474511434429"><title>The Israel Privatization Law</title>
<p>The 2004 Prisons Ordinance Amendment Law (Amendment 28) provided for the establishment of one prison in Israel to be operated and managed by a private corporation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1462474511434429">5</xref></sup> After the passage of the Amendment, a tender process was undertaken, and the contract to construct, operate and manage the prison was let to an Israeli corporation, A.L.A. Management and Operation (2005) Ltd.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1462474511434429">6</xref></sup> The new prison was to be situated near the desert city of Beer-Sheba, and would accommodate 800 prisoners. The construction of the prison had already been completed before the Supreme Court decision was handed down.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1462474511434429">7</xref></sup> Subsequently, it was sold to the Israel Prison Service, which now operates it as part of the public sector prison system.</p>
<p>The statutory model created in Amendment 28 was, in the words of Justice Beinisch, the President of the Court, the ‘improved English model’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1462474511434429">8</xref></sup> This was shorthand for the fact that the powers of the operator and regime standards would be tightly regulated by the State. The defining characteristics included the following:
<list id="list1-1462474511434429" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the State would select the successful bidder according to criteria that did not merely address price factors but included also regime quality factors;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the State would have comprehensive powers to approve, veto or remove staff;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the powers of the staff would be no greater, and in some respects would be less, than those of members of the Israeli Prison Service;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>these powers included strip-searching in circumstances identical to those in which the Israeli Prison Service staff were entitled to carry out strip searches;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the areas where those powers were less extensive related particularly to the right of staff to use disciplinary procedures that would have the effect of increasing the effective length of a prisoner’s sentence;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the State would determine which prisoners would be sent to the prison and when and where they would be transferred to other prisons;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the State, acting through the Israeli Prison Service, would have untrammelled power to make unannounced or announced inspections of the prison operations or some particular aspect of those operations;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the contract to operate and manage the prison set out performance standards in precise detail;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the State would have an on-site monitoring presence to check contract compliance; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the State retained the right to revoke the contract altogether for a wide range of performance deficiencies.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The High Court accepted the State’s submission that part of its motivation in privatizing the prison was to improve conditions in Israeli prisons and for Israeli prisoners, both at the particular prison and by way of flow-on effects into the public sector prisons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1462474511434429">9</xref></sup> The State conceded, and the Court accepted, that an additional element was to reduce the per capita costs of running the prison.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1462474511434429">10</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1462474511434429"><title>The constitutional challenge</title>
<p>Various petitioners, including an NGO and a serving prisoner, challenged the constitutionality of Amendment 28, on the basis that it contravened the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, of the State of Israel, in particular section 5.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1462474511434429">11</xref></sup> The Basic Law creates a ‘super-legislative Constitutional right [to Human Dignity and Liberty] that every government authority is liable to respect’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1462474511434429">12</xref></sup> It was argued that imprisonment inevitably entails a serious violation of various human rights including the rights to life, to personal liberty and to human dignity. All imprisonment thus prima facie contravenes section 5 of the Basic Law, so that statutes relating to imprisonment should be interpreted in the light of its provisions.</p>
<p>However, the right to personal liberty and human dignity is not absolute. The relevant part of the Basic Law contains a limitations clause that permits some statutory inroads to be made. Any such inroads must be proportionate, and can only be justified if done in order to further an essential public interest. That being so, it was argued that the Basic Law operated in such a way that the State could not validly transfer to a private enterprise the implementation of tasks that necessarily involve the violation of those rights, for any such transfer would inevitably be disproportionate.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1462474511434429"><title>The majority approach: Core state functions are non-delegable, however conscientiously and accountably this is done</title>
<p>In considering the constitutional challenge, the majority<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1462474511434429">13</xref></sup> proceeded on the basis that ‘there is no empirical proof that the manner of operating private prisons necessarily leads to a greater violation of the inmates’ human rights than that in the state-managed prisons’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1462474511434429">14</xref></sup> Thus, the issue was argued on the basis that, <italic>in the abstract</italic>, privatization contravened the Basic Law, regardless of how well or how badly it was done and whether or not the regime conditions would be better or worse. In other words, the central tenet of radical opposition to privatization per se – that prison management is a non-delegable <italic>core state function</italic> – would be integral to the decision in the case.</p>
<p>The majority ruled that Amendment 28 was unconstitutional, contravening the Basic Law. The President, Justice Beinisch, set out what would seem to be the <italic>ratio decidendi</italic> of the case<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1462474511434429">15</xref></sup> as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>The conclusion we have reached is that Amendment 28 causes an additional independent violation of the constitutional right to personal liberty beyond the violation that arises from imprisonment itself. It can therefore be said that our position is that the scope of this violation of a prison inmate’s constitutional right to personal liberty, when the entity responsible for his imprisonment is a private corporation motivated by economic considerations of profit and loss, is inherently greater than the violation of the same right of an inmate when the entity responsible for his imprisonment is a government authority that is not motivated by those considerations, even if the term of imprisonment that these two inmates serve is identical and even if the violation of human rights that actually takes place behind the walls of each of the two prisons where they serve their sentences is identical.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1462474511434429">16</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Parallel reasoning was applicable to the aspect of the Basic Law concerned with human dignity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1462474511434429">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Court thus endorsed the non-delegable <italic>core state function</italic> proposition that has been the subject of so much academic debate since the late twentieth-century revival of prison privatization in the USA, the UK and Australia. The Court, including the President, quoted at length from the writings of Nils Christie, John DiIulio and Ira Robbins<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1462474511434429">18</xref></sup> – each a noted opponent of privatization.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1462474511434429"><title>A different slant looking to the actual risk of additional impingement upon human rights</title>
<p>Justice Procaccia, who came to the same conclusion as the majority, took a slightly different approach. In her view the need to make a profit over a period of time <italic>increased the risk</italic> of there being an <italic>actual impingement</italic> upon the human rights of prisoners, beyond those that necessarily are inherent in the state-managed prison system. She stated:<disp-quote>
<p>The private enterprise<italic> </italic>… has never internalized the doctrine of balances in the exercise of sovereign power<italic> </italic>… The doctrine of balances, which demands that the public interest in maintaining order should be weighed against the duty to limit the violation of human rights to what is absolutely essential for achieving the purpose, is a doctrine that it does not know. The mechanisms of training, education, supervision and discipline that are built into the civil service for its employees, and which define the rules of exercising sovereign power, do not apply to it<italic> </italic>… Its entry into fields that are clearly areas of sovereign activity is motivated by private considerations of profitability<italic> </italic>… Introducing various elements of viability into considerations of exercising power involves a potential for a real violation of the proper equilibrium between the relevant considerations that should be taken into account when exercising the power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1462474511434429">19</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The decision in such cases turns, in Her Honour’s view, on a question of balance:<disp-quote>
<p>The potential violation of the inmate’s core basic rights, which is expected to occur as a result of the privatization of the sovereign power, conflicts with the potential benefit to the inmate deriving from the improvement in his welfare and his living conditions, together with an economic benefit to the public. What is the result of the balance between these values, and which of them takes precedence?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1462474511434429">20</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Her Honour’s answer is that the value of the State’s retaining sovereign power in its own hands takes precedence:<disp-quote>
<p>The benefit to the prison inmate that will arise from the privatization of the sovereign coercive authority and the economic benefit to the State are not commensurate with, and are even dwarfed by, the violation of the prison inmate’s core human rights that can be expected to result from entrusting sovereign coercive authority to a private concessionaire.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1462474511434429">21</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This is because ‘considerations of economic feasibility and private profit-making are completely foreign to the doctrine of balances in the exercise of sovereign coercive authority’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1462474511434429">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>It should be noted that the logic of formulating the issue this way is that a structure that eliminated all potential for conflict of interest arising out of commercial considerations – for example, by delegating imprisonment to a not-for-profit NGO or some other organ of civil society – might comply with the constitutional requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1462474511434429">23</xref></sup> In other words, the <italic>core state function</italic> principle would not necessarily invalidate such an arrangement, for the balance may tip the other way.</p>
<p>In her judgment the President, as we have seen, avowedly adopted the abstract, or content-free, approach. This was so central to her approach and that of the remainder of the majority, that she deemed it necessary explicitly to counter and reject the somewhat more empirical, but hardly radical, approach of Justice Procaccia:<disp-quote>
<p>Moreover, in my opinion there is a concern that if we accept the balancing formula proposed by my colleague Justice Procaccia, this will undermine to a large degree the manner in which the limits of the permitted violations of human rights are defined within the context of the limitations clause, because it may be assumed that in a considerable number of cases<italic> </italic>… it will also be possible to ‘translate’ the value of public interest that is weighed on the scales against the violated human right into another human right<italic> </italic>… An analysis of this kind is likely to obscure the distinction between the human rights that are protected in our system and the values and interests that may justify a violation of those rights. My concern is that this conceptual obfuscation contains a potential for weakening the extent of the constitutional protection of human rights in our system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1462474511434429">24</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The majority position, then, leaves no way back for prison privatization to occur in modern Israel. The statutory provisions could not be re-drafted or the supervisory systems fortified so as to overcome the philosophical barrier erected by the High Court’s interpretation of the Basic Law.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1462474511434429"><title>The dissenting judgment: ‘Dealing with an egg that has not yet been laid’</title>
<p>The dissentient, Justice EE Levy, characterized the majority approach as ‘dealing with an egg that has not yet been laid’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1462474511434429">25</xref></sup> His analytical approach was evidence-based rather than abstract – to try to deal with the on-the-ground realities of the Israel prison system and regimes, and evaluate whether the attempt to address aspects of the problems through the privatization proposal could be fairly fitted within the Basic Law and general constitutional principles.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the force and reach of the Basic Law, he argued that the rights to liberty and to human dignity, as necessarily limited by the fact of imprisonment, nevertheless underpin a corollary or implied right – the right of prisoners to proper prison conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1462474511434429">26</xref></sup> This is a ‘social right’, and as such is only attainable through the intervention of the State. At the present day, His Honour argued, the picture of what happens in Israel prisons is ‘chilling’: ‘The basic rights of persons under arrest and prison inmates are violated on a daily basis as a matter of course.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1462474511434429">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>His Honour referred to documented evidence of:<disp-quote>
<p>blatant departures from the minimum requirements for holding persons<italic> </italic>… especially with regard to the problem of overcrowding and overpopulation and the lack of sufficient living space for each person, sleeping on the floor without a bed, the lack of cleanliness and sanitary rules and the lack of sufficient ventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1462474511434429">28</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Other examples cited by Justice Levy were derived from the findings of the Public Defender’s Office to similar effect.</p>
<p>In addition to infrastructure deficiencies Justice Levy referred also to evidence of violence against prisoners by Israel Prison Service staff; to exposure to the vicissitudes of the weather; to inadequate provision of medical treatment; to very poor opportunities for family visits; to limitations upon access to lawyers and the courts; and to the shortage of rehabilitative, educational and vocational programmes. Other documented matters concerned appalling hygiene in shower areas, flea and other insect infestation in cells and other areas and extremely repressive conditions for prisoners held in the isolation wing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1462474511434429">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The judgment of the President, Justice Beinisch, makes virtually no reference to these matters. Yet they were not really in dispute. For example, two Israeli commentators who were avowedly opposed to privatization conceded in their arguments that the Israel prison system is seriously overcrowded and well short of decency standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1462474511434429">Preminger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1462474511434429">Press, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1462474511434429">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>His Honour, Justice Levy, discussed how privatization might work out, in practice. The available world literature was not, in his view, definitive. Privatization might produce better conditions or it might produce worse; the State might rigorously carry out its regulatory role or it might not be competent or effective in supervising the new arrangements; the financial incentives of the concessionaire may erode the standards and bring about conflicts of interest or the financial penalties might work so as to cement good standards into the regime; and so on.</p>
<p>However, all of these factors are unknown and, His Honour implied, unknowable in prospect. They could only become retrospectively apparent in the light of actual experience. To repeat his striking metaphor, we are still dealing with an egg that has not yet been laid. There was as yet no breach of the Basic Law to review. Accordingly,<disp-quote>
<p>[P]rospective constitutional scrutiny is possible only when there is a high probability<italic> </italic>… that the assumptions underlying it will be realized. A concern of a future violation of a protected right can be used to prevent that violation <italic>ab initio </italic>… provided that there is a sufficiently strong basis for this in current data. This is the reason why I have difficulty in reconciling myself to a position that is based upon a <italic>potential</italic> violation of rights, when the chances that it will occur are not currently known.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1462474511434429">31</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Justice Levy also addressed the proposition that the whole privatization structure is fatally tainted by the fact that the concessionaire would aim to make a profit:<disp-quote>
<p>In my view it is a mistake<italic> </italic>… to think that privatization naturally focuses on the economic interest of the concessionaire or on the savings in the State’s expenditure relating to the prisons. Not merely from the public perspective, although this is of paramount relevance, the privatization seeks first and foremost to realize the public interest in having a proper and efficient prison system<italic> </italic>… The economic incentive is merely a tool in the service of the public interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1462474511434429">32</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This weighing in the balance precisely reflects what the President, Justice Beinisch, sought to rule out in her earlier comment that ‘an analysis of this kind is likely to obscure the distinction between the human rights that are protected in our system and the values and interests that may justify a violation of those rights.’</p>
<p>With regard to the core state function argument, Justice Levy referred to the fact that ‘there are other cases where the privatization of core powers has already become firmly rooted in our legal system’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1462474511434429">33</xref></sup> In the correctional field this includes the serving of penalties that involve unpaid work where private institutions (albeit not-for profit) often administer the sentence. Similar arrangements exist in the area of involuntary detention in a psychiatric institution and, perhaps most notably, in the privatization of security services at public sites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1462474511434429">34</xref></sup> The latter includes the staffing of military checkpoints in the Occupied Territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1462474511434429">Preminger, 2008</xref>). Given that ‘the right to human dignity is a super-legislative constitutional right that every government authority is liable to respect’ (to quote Justice Beinisch), the question arises as to how these arrangements can constitutionally be differentiated from prison privatization.</p>
<p>His Honour also addressed the accountability arrangements created by Amendment 28. These arrangements are extensive, more so than those applicable to the Israel Prison Service itself. The additional features would have included: liability to be audited under the State Comptroller Act; the creation of an advisory committee for inmates’ rights, rehabilitation and welfare; a clearly expressed contract setting out the services that must be provided; financial sanctions for inadequate performance; and no immunity against actions in tort.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1462474511434429">35</xref></sup> None of these accountability tools are applicable to public sector prisons managed by the Israel Prison Service. Against a background where the breaches of prisoners’ rights by the Israel Prison Service have been ‘chilling’, the whole regulatory scheme under Amendment 28 was calculated to reduce the inroads into personal liberty and human dignity that the Basic Law sought to address.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1462474511434429" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>For Israel there would, as already stated, seem to be no way back. Under the existing Constitution, prison privatization of the sort contemplated under Amendment 28 cannot occur.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1462474511434429">36</xref></sup> Two main questions arise. First, what does this mean for the broader issue of regime quality within the Israel prison system? Second, does the decision have any implications for prison privatization elsewhere?</p>
<sec id="sec8-1462474511434429"><title>Regime standards</title>
<p>Israel does not have an autonomous inspection system, akin to that of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Prisons or the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. Nor has Israel signed or ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, which requires states parties to establish autonomous inspection agencies (‘national preventive mechanisms’) with jurisdiction over all closed institutions so as to ascertain whether there has been torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in the regime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1462474511434429">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, by way of custom and practice, though not legal entitlement, the Public Defender’s Office has ready access to prisons. Justice Levy drew upon aspects of the Office’s 2006 report on 15 prisons. There have been earlier reports that broadly tell the same story.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1462474511434429">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel publishes regular reports upon the state of human rights in Israel and the Occupied Territories. In relation to prison conditions, the Association draws upon the reports of the Public Defender and judicial decisions. Its 2007 Report notes: The various rulings of the Supreme Court as to human rights in prisons ‘have not yet been internalized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474511434429">Association for Civil Rights in Israel, 2007</xref>: 60). The Ministry of Internal Security has stated that a team has been appointed within the Israel Prison Service to implement the recommendations contained in the Public Defender’s 2006 report. The documentation contained in Justice Levy’s judgment would seem to indicate that very little, if any, improvement has flowed from the appointment of this in-house team.</p>
<p>Another recent assessment has concluded that Israel’s state-run prisons are ‘abysmal with prisoners and security detainees cramped into crowded, squalid cells bereft of adequate beds and toilet facilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1462474511434429">Press, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Relevant also is the point that torture is known still to occur in Israel in prisons and other closed institutions. The Public Committee against Torture in Israel (PCATI) has documented the extent and nature of ‘ticking time bomb torture’ carried out by the General Security Service against Palestinian detainees. This torture includes sleep deprivation, tightened shackling, tilting the torso, half-crouching, slapping and beating. These abuses are often carried out in situations where the prisoner is held incommunicado (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1462474511434429">Ginbar, 2010</xref>: 175). This is the situation in which torture is most likely to be perpetrated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1462474511434429">39</xref></sup> There is little, if anything, in the accountability arrangements for public sector prisons or other places of detention to inhibit such practices.</p>
<p>The paradox is that the private concessionaire would stand outside this in-house (non-accountability) structure. With so many additional regulatory mechanisms in place, the transparency of regime standards would potentially be transformed. In the particular case of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the inhibiting factors would be robust. Also, with the fresh start that a green-fields prison and a new workforce would have enabled, it is highly unlikely that the unacceptable physical conditions akin to those in existing prisons would occur or that poor regime standards would be tolerated.</p>
<p>This has been the experience in the UK – upon whose privatization model the Israel approach was based. Indicia of this include: the ‘churning’ of two poorly performing private sector prisons back to the public sector; the imposition of a state administrator upon another until such time as the regime stabilized back up to contractual and statutory standards; the rigorous and frequent reports of the autonomous Prisons Inspectorate; and the ongoing scrutiny of the media, academia and civil society.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1462474511434429"><title>Implications beyond the Israel situation</title>
<p>The response to the <italic>core state function</italic> argument has included the argument that the punishment imposed upon and being served by the offender has been allocated by the State, via an independent judiciary, and that only the day-to-day administration of that punishment has been contracted out. The prisoner remains a prisoner of the State, and does not become a prisoner of the concessionaire in any legal sense. Moreover, the administration of that punishment has been so carefully regulated that administration cannot merge into allocation by, for instance, the effective increase of sentence by way of disciplinary charges.</p>
<p>The majority was not impressed by the allocation/administration argument. The President stated:<disp-quote>
<p>The decision of the competent courts of the state to sentence a particular person to imprisonment is the source of the power to violate the constitutional right of that individual to personal liberty. But the actual violation of the right to personal liberty takes place on a daily basis as long as he remains an inmate of the prison. This violation of the right to personal liberty is inflicted by the party that manages and operates the prison where the inmate is held in custody, and by the employees of that party, whose main purpose is to ensure that the inmate duly serves the term of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1462474511434429">40</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The sequence of events that result in criminal charge, trial, conviction, sentence, imprisonment and release constitutes an unbreakable continuum of the assertion of power by the State, therefore.</p>
<p>The argument is unyielding. The decision would be the same even if it could be demonstrated that the prison conditions in Israel were in profound and continuous breach of every international standard, of every domestic Israel standard and of every expectation of decency. For the High Court majority, matters such as the ‘decency agenda’ or running a ‘healthy prison’ (to invoke the UK dialectic) or compliance with international human rights law (to invoke international standards of the UN Convention against Torture or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1462474511434429">41</xref></sup> are simply irrelevant.</p>
<p>The High Court of Justice decision means that, as a matter of abstract philosophy, the management of prisons will always be a matter for the State, however badly it does this task. It seems that the end – improving prison regimes – can never justify the means – removing detailed, direct, day-to-day responsibility from the State to the private sector.</p>
<p>Will the Israeli approach cross boundaries? Can there be a successful constitutional challenge in other states that have privatized prisons? It is an intriguing question, given the geographic spread of privatization – from the USA to the UK, from Australia to New Zealand, now emerging in South America (Chile and Peru), adopted in South Africa by the post-apartheid government, being toyed with in parts of Asia (Japan and Thailand), taking the form of partial privatization of functions in some European countries (France and Germany).</p>
<p>It has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474511434429">Ludlow, 2010</xref>: 329) that privatization may now be held to violate the European Convention on Human Rights. The Israel High Court briefly addressed this point, but seemed to accept the view of the expert witness, Professor Jowell, that there was a ‘lack of a ground of incompatibility with the Convention’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1462474511434429">42</xref></sup> A United Nations report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474511434429">Palley, 1993</xref>) had earlier addressed the broader issue of the compatibility of prison privatization with international human rights law. It was suggested that the requirement of the UN Standard Minimum Standard Rules that ‘prison administration personnel shall be prison officers and have civil service status with security of tenure’ (Rule 46(3)) should be taken into account in the interpretation of national laws. Palley used this Rule as the first building block in a complex argument that prison privatization contravenes international humanitarian law. A 13-step argument was constructed from this starting point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474511434429">Palley, 1993</xref>: para. 66), but it must be said that it collapses under the weight of its own complex super-structure.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, opponents of privatization will now be encouraged to peruse the potential for challenges in each of the current and any future privatization countries, whether derived from domestic law, State constitutions, regional charters, international instruments, and any other source. The Costa Rican decision, referred to in Section 1, may possibly offer some encouragement within Latin-American jurisdictions, for it did not entirely close off the possibility of successful challenge. However, the strong likelihood is that the Israeli decision will ultimately be seen as being limited to its own particular context.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most telling phrase in the judgment refers to the fact that ‘the limits of the tolerated violation of human rights’ should continue to lie with the public sector.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1462474511434429">43</xref></sup> The High Court apparently understood, though the majority Judges did not say so explicitly,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1462474511434429">44</xref></sup> that the existing public sector Israel prison system was below acceptable standards and in some respects breaches international human rights laws.</p>
<p>The paradox is that the ‘limits of the tolerated violation of human rights’ may well have been reduced if the privatization initiative had gone ahead. This is because the accountability arrangements of Amendment 28 markedly exceeded those applicable to the public sector. However high-minded the motivation of the Supreme Court, it may have missed an opportunity to nudge the Israel prison system slowly towards a much-needed improvement in regime standards.</p></sec></sec>
