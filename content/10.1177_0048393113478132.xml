<abstract>
<p>R. Keith Sawyer rightly claimed that the formulation of several cross-level regularities does not disprove the “autonomy” of sciences. Nevertheless, first, this autonomy becomes gradual because cross-level regularities narrow the scope for strong emergence and, second, these examples do not disprove the metaphysical premises of Kim’s critique. Sawyer and I concur on the thesis according to which the proof of strong emergence is in part an empirical question. However, it also depends on the concept of individualism applied whether a description or explanation can count as reducible or not. Even if some of the examples given might leave open the possibility of strong emergence, to generalize, to consider relations or to point to the unpredictability of social processes do not prove the existence of irreducible multiple realization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>I am very grateful to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0048393113478132">R. Keith Sawyer (2012)</xref> for his discussion of my contribution. We agree on the fact that the debate on social emergence—like that on emergence in general—is unlikely to be finalized soon. What can be done, however, is to weigh different arguments and assess their consequences. One of the reasons for this situation is linked to one of the most basic questions in this debate. If we discuss reducibility, either we may ask to which extent reductions are accomplished in practice, or we may ask to which extent reducibility or irreducibility in principle are possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0048393113478132">Bedau 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0048393113478132">Brodbeck 1972</xref>, 310). The question of reducibility is in part a question of developments in empirical sciences. If a complete reduction of all sciences to one basic science had been accomplished, the status of science could be considered as arbiter. But since there is a great body of scientific knowledge, which is not (yet) reduced, it might be true that parts of our knowledge are nonreducible in principle, not simply in practice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the debate on emergence and reduction is not limited to the practice of the sciences but also consists of discussing metaphysical or ontological arguments for assuming reducibility or nonreducibility. Kim’s critique follows this path: given the premises of physicalism, for him the idea of irreducible causal powers of higher-order properties becomes unjustifiable.</p>
<p>Where Sawyer and I agree is that there is no all-encompassing physical science and that the viability of this option depends in part on the future of the sciences. Where we disagree is on two points: first, I claimed and still claim that Fodor’s (and Putnam’s) model of multiple realization does not solve the contradiction discovered by Kim. Second, I doubt that in sociology there is a very convincing basis to claim strong emergence for social phenomena. I admit that there might be emergence, but there is also evidence, which contradicts this claim. This evidence relies on two points, which I will develop a little bit further in this reply: first, the claim for irreducibility depends to a significant degree on conceptual questions, and second, often the derivation of higher-order social predicates is simply the result of reducible aggregations. I am going to develop this with regard to the examples that Sawyer mentions in his response. But the first part of my reply will address the relation between Fodor and Kim’s claims.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0048393113478132">
<title>1. Fodor and Kim</title>
<p>I started from the observation that, for Fodor, downward causation is not some constitutive moment of the autonomy of sciences. For him, the central element is the heterogeneity of vocabularies. My claim is that the incorporation of downward causation would undermine the claim of autonomy because lawlike relations would determine relations between the vocabularies of the sciences: something that contradicts the justification for autonomy of the sciences. Sawyer’s argument seems to be that this is not a valid critique, because there might be wildly disjunctive realized social properties causing individual states. I do not doubt that we find cross-classifying regularities. Especially in psychology a significant turn toward other—presumably more basic—sciences can be noticed. For example, there now is growing research concerning the relationship between behavior and hormones. There is some evidence that status threats heighten testosterone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0048393113478132">Josephs et al. 2006</xref>, 1000) and that high testosterone levels lead to diminished problem-solving capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0048393113478132">Mehta and Josephs 2011</xref>, 179ff.) or that oxytocin levels do influence the choice of social distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0048393113478132">Scheele et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course there are good reasons not to discard the assumption of a relative autonomy of the sciences as a whole, because these correlations are not perfect and they also describe “insular” aspects; that is, they contain no general theory of how all mental or social conditions would translate into chemical states and so on.</p>
<p>What are the implications of such cross-level regularities? First, they do not fit very well into the Fodorian picture of sciences. These cross-level regularities do undermine the autonomy of sciences in the sense that they cannot be assigned to one science. Note that downward causational regularities cannot be deductively determined by means of same-level laws (otherwise, the idea of multiple realization would be lost). Second, Sawyer argues that downward causality is simply an extension of the causal potential of the multiply realized higher-order property. But to the extent to which up- and downward causational regularities can be detected, the scope of wild disjunction is limited. Thus, if we confine the justification of strong emergence to the empirical status of knowledge, every addition to knowledge narrows the scope of strong emergence. The only way to avoid this conclusion would consist in some metaphysical argument that shows how even complete knowledge of down- and upward relations would leave some room for nonreducibility. Finally, Kim’s argument does not depend on the state of empirical knowledge. Thus, the trouble with Sawyer’s (and others’) reply to Kim is even more basic. Even if downward causation was consistent with Fodor’s model, the question to what extent the whole model is apt to invalidate Kim’s argument would remain. To accomplish this, it would be necessary to challenge the premises or the deductive implications of Kim’s argument; but since the empirical status of the sciences is not part of Kim’s argument, empirical knowledge offers no reasons to cast doubt on Kim’s critique.</p>
<p>Kim’s critique of strong emergence of course refers to types in the form of causal profiles of different properties. If causality referred only to tokens, emergent properties as causal properties could not even be distinguished from properties of realizing elements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0048393113478132">
<title>2. The Autonomy of Social Phenomena</title>
<p>Sawyer doubts that a decisive asymmetry between the claim for mental and social emergence exists. I confess (and I did already in the original paper) that this asymmetry cannot be deduced from a priori reasoning. But, especially if you ask for reducibility on the basis of empirical observations, it is legitimate to ask for the degree in which the vocabulary of a certain science is autonomous from its assumed basis.</p>
<p>Folk psychology and its applications and extensions in “verstehende Soziologie” in particular are essential ways of explaining actions by means of understanding wishes, beliefs, and so on, but they do not for their application constitutively depend on giving physical descriptions. My core argument is that, in contrast to this autonomy of explanations, the assumption of independence of social properties is basically due much more to conceptual presuppositions and operations than to substantial empirical knowledge (see already <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0048393113478132">Zahle 2003</xref>). I am going to argue in favor of this observation by making three points: First, the extent to which social and individual properties can be distinguished critically depends on the notions of individual and social properties. Second, I am going to look at the examples offered by Sawyer to examine under what conditions they might count as proof for the existence of some independent properties with their own causal profile. This extends to my third point, concerning the necessity of differentiating between levels for the proof of social emergence.</p>
<sec id="section4-0048393113478132">
<title>2.1. The Ontology of Social Phenomena</title>
<p>If we follow Max Weber, the distinction between social and individual properties seems odd from the beginning because, according to him, social phenomena consist in the orientations of individuals toward other individuals. This kind of individualism implies the independence not of the orientations of the actors but of other actors, and it allows for considering relations as part of an individualistic conception of sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0048393113478132">Zahle 2003</xref>, 79), at least in principle.</p>
<p>Two basic ontological questions are (1) what kind of social objects are there? and (2) how can we conceive of the existence of social objects that are not individuals? One way to answer these questions has been proposed by Parsons. During his structural-functionalist phase, a decisive shift from Weber’s model toward a different model can be found. Three steps in his conceptualization can be distinguished: (1) Parsons introduces social objects as other actors, distinguished from nonsocial objects that do not (possibly) react to ego’s expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0048393113478132">Parsons et al. 1951</xref>, 15). I will call this model 1. (2) The analysis of the interaction is focused on “When we analyze the interaction of ego and alter, we shift from the analysis of a single given actor to the consideration of two or more interacting actors as a system” (15). (3) Parsons distinguishes the system of interaction (social system) from the personality systems of the actors: “But ego and alter in interaction with each other also constitute a system. This is a system of a new order, which, however intimately dependent on them, does not simply consist of the personalities of the two members” (23). This forms model 2.</p>
<p>If we equate personality systems with individuals, we notice a decisive shift from model 1 to model 2: the object, which is independent from the actor, has changed. In the first model, other actors are independent from the particular actor, whereas in the second model, it is the system of interaction, which is independent from all the actors. From the perspective of the first model, the interaction consists in the orientations of the actors; in the second model, this assumption is no longer necessarily implied.</p>
<p>Two questions follow: First, if we read the distinction between the systems as analytical,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0048393113478132">1</xref></sup> how can we understand causality as something working independently? Second, there is a tension (<italic>interaction consists of the orientation of the actors</italic> vs. <italic>interaction is independent of the actors</italic>) between the two models, and it is easy to see what is necessary in order to show that they are not in contradiction: we need a theory that enables us to distinguish clearly between orientations belonging to the personality systems and orientations belonging to the social system (making up the social system). If we cannot do that, it becomes difficult even to pose the question of reducibility or irreducibility because we have not identified some basic science in the light of which this question should be decided. It is beyond the scope of this reply to examine the different approaches for making a clear-cut distinction between social and psychological properties. But I am stressing this point because one way to avoid this problem would consist in what I think is the Weberian answer, namely to resist the reification of higher-order notions by understanding social orientations as a special class of individual orientations (thus making a basic identity claim).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0048393113478132">
<title>2.2. Examples</title>
<p>In the following section, I am going to argue that many of the arguments against individualism are based not on the existence of a conceptually closed social science but simply consist in an unnecessarily restrictive reading of individualism. For example, one might identify individualism with atomism, meaning that individualist theory would have to explain social phenomena on the basis of individuals considered in isolation. Since there are no isolated individuals and there is no theory of the behavior of isolated individuals, individualism seems to be refuted from the beginning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0048393113478132">Bunge 1979</xref>). But this idea of individualism is not identical to the Weberian understanding of individualism. Thus, the critique of individualism is tied to a conceptual decision whose necessity has to be demonstrated. A second strategy consists in the claim that generalizations of individual properties are in contradistinction to individualism. I am going to argue that this strategy can be found in Durkheim’s paradigmatic research on suicide as well as in some of the examples that Sawyer mentions. The argument thus is, multiple realization does not prove irreducibility if it can simply be understood as a generalizing function using individual properties.</p>
<p>In Durkheim’s social theory, the individuals are considered to be the base for the emerging social predicates; they are considered as presocial entities, which in turn must be shaped by society to become human in a genuine sense and so on. I do not want to go into these complex relationships but want to stress the strategy that Durkheim uses to distinguish the individual and the social states in his path-breaking study on suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0048393113478132">Durkheim 1951</xref>). This strategy consists in the use of constructing group-related means. Social integration is determined by the integration of individuals into the relevant groups. As I have already argued in my original paper, this is an emergent property of the group but one that is reducible because it is fixed exactly by the properties of the individuals. The same operation is used with respect to the explanandum, because the suicide rates aggregate individual suicides. As is well known, the respective social laws for Durkheim reads degree of group integration → suicide rate, combined with a threshold function according to which an upper and lower degree of integration causes the suicide rate to grow. It is difficult not to understand this function as a certain kind of “psychological” function, but I will not go into this aspect of his explanation.</p>
<p>The more important observation is that the collective states are simply the results of aggregation and the computation of averages. Thus, to what extent can these results be understood as irreducible properties? From the operational point of view, they are simple functions of individual states (individual integration into the group and the individual decisions to commit suicide). One might describe these cases as cases of “aggregate” social phenomena (following Richard Levins’s proposal, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0048393113478132">Wimsatt 2006</xref>, 668).</p>
<p>What really gives this argumentation the air of independence is the generalization, which is involved. Lack of integration can be multiply realized in a variety of ways, that is, relative to groups such as families, churches, nations, and so on, or in feelings of different shapes (e.g., feeling being left alone, feeling helpless, feeling disliked). The merit of Durkheim’s findings is not to be denied—especially if it is compared to other explanations that at Durkheim’s time were still used. Furthermore, the value of his explanation lies in the identification of some common factor operating in different forms. But strong emergence is not justified here: the higher-level properties (rate of integration and rates of suicide) are simply the generalizations of lower-level properties; to argue that there is some common element in the different realizations does not make this property a higher-order property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0048393113478132">Heil 1999</xref>, 202, 204). If every generalization would count as establishing strong emergence, even physics (!) would be describing higher-order properties because properties such as mass and acceleration are also multiply realized.</p>
<p>Sawyer’s example of sex ratio also offers no argument against individualism as it is understood here, even if the reduced phenomena are marked much more by the interactions of the parts (something like Levins’s composed system; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0048393113478132">Wimsatt 2006</xref>, 668). It is nevertheless reducible because the state of the system as such (sex ratio) is explained by the properties of the elements. As in the Schelling case of segregation, the overall result is an aggregation of individual properties (sex), and the dynamics can be explained by the distribution of individuals’ genetic endowment because the individual’s opportunity to reproduce is determined by the existence of other individuals with the opposite sex. In this again multiple realization and reducibility are not at odds.</p>
<p>As in the example of Durkheim’s study on suicide, this reduction would not count as a reduction to individuals only if we argue (1) that reduction to individuals would imply reduction to every detail of the reducing entity or (2) that relations toward other individuals could in principle not be reduced to the properties of the entities that stand in the relation. Nevertheless, in the examples given, reduction does not mean reduction to an infinite description of all individual properties but to the relevant properties, and the relation (allowing for reproduction or causing suicide) is entirely fixed by the given properties of the individuals.</p>
<p>Thus, one might look for cases in which the relation does not seem to allow for a reduction to individual properties. One might call this the class of nonreducible complex systems. Sawyer draws on network theory to give reasons for such a perspective. But in network theory again no consensus exists with regard to the question of reducibility or nonreducibility of network relations. Network research is thus combined with structuralist, culturalist, and reductionist action-oriented approaches, as in rational choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0048393113478132">Burt 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0048393113478132">Emirbayer and Goodwin 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0048393113478132">Lin 1999</xref>), and prima facie, the existence of opportunities for actors as such does not necessarily invalidate an individualistic explanation.</p>
<p>The extent to which conceptual decisions can predetermine the answer on reducibility can also be demonstrated in the example of the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0048393113478132">Woolley et al. (2010)</xref>: Since group performance is the result of a division of labor, it is unlikely that the group performance as such can be reduced to the performance of one individual or to the individual performances considered as unrelated acts. Here again, if we identify individuals with atomism, already the irreducibility to the individual’s IQ might count as an indicator of irreducibility. If, on the other hand, we do not presuppose that the better explanations of group IQ by the social sensibility or the conversational behaviors (688) necessarily count as nonindividualistic, the question of reducibility is not answered by this example.</p>
<p>Notice that I do not claim that the question of reducibility is only a conceptual question. I did use the example of Blau’s work on structural effects to argue that it does not offer an empirical proof of autonomous causal impacts of groups, because he does not control for the processes of sanctioning behavior by others. I agree with Sawyer and with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0048393113478132">Dave Elder-Vass (2010)</xref>, who made the similar point that this does not prove the reducibility either (a claim I did not make; my claim has been that it does not prove reducibility). If we consider the debate on reducibility as an empirical question, there will always be a gap in answering the question of reducibility in principle, at least in the sense that there might be examples, which hint at possible irreducibility. Thus, in the example given by Woolley et al., it might be that there is no individualistic explanation for conversational dynamics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0048393113478132">
<title>2.3. Levels</title>
<p>This brings me to a third observation. If examples can be used to decide on the question of reducibility or irreducibility, they should be related to the question of levels. Fodor’s argument is based on the idea that we can find (comprehensible) laws on one level whereas no (comprehensible) laws can be found on the other level. If we use this criterion, we can see why Sawyer rightly hints at the uncertain status of his own research on group creativity as an indicator for strong emergence. Group creativity could count as an indicator for emergence if we detected group creativity laws but no individual creativity laws or vice versa. Thus, if we have indeterminacy at every “level,” this indeterminacy does not prove the irreducibility of levels. The same “justification” of synchronic by means of diachronic emergence can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0048393113478132">Mayntz (2009)</xref>. On the one hand, she relies on Broad’s definition of emergence that “system-, macro-, or higher-level properties are ‘emergent’ if they cannot be explained by the properties and behavior of the system elements considered in isolation or in a different system” (148). On the other hand, she convincingly argues that there are no system laws of social change due to the context sensitivity of processes (150). But, if we do not have laws of individual behavior or social processes, the nonexistence of social laws might simply be the result of the nonexistence of laws concerning individual behavior and thus cannot prove the emergence of autonomous social processes.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0048393113478132" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>I agree with Sawyer that the question of social emergence is still unsettled and that it is in part an empirical question, only answered in the process of empirical research. Essentially, this reply contains three observations. First, even if the existence of social emergence has to do with empirical research, it also depends on metaphysical (or ontological) and conceptual arguments. Sawyer rightly claims that isolated discoveries of cross-level regularities do not commit us to the view that there can be no “autonomous” sciences. Nevertheless, it is plausible to argue that every discovery of such cross-level relations constrains the extent to which levels can be conceived of as independent levels. In addition, what I maybe did not stress accurately enough in my original paper has been the question as to what extent empirical findings might even answer the metaphysical problem posed by Kim’s critique, which is not based on empirical observations but on metaphysical premises, which in turn would have to be challenged by the critics. Second, the debate suffers from conceptual problems, concerning the question of the relation of multiple realization and irreducibility and the question of what would count as a basis of reduction. Every science consists in the description of phenomena, which are multiply realized because science identifies general properties realized in a variety of concrete phenomena. Thus, the question is not whether there is multiple realization but to what extent multiple realization means irreducibility. To ask for reducibility means also to ask what the reducing base would look like. As we have seen, some conceptual decisions on what we consider to be a reductive base are so narrow that the idea of reduction seems flawed from the beginning, like the description of every concrete individual (thus unwarrantedly making generalization as such a justification of strong emergence) or individual states that are independent of every concrete situation that the individuals are involved in (atomism). I have argued that individualism does not entail the denial of generalization or relatedness to other individuals. Finally, test cases for emergence should be based on the independence of levels. The complexity and the unpredictability of social phenomena as such do not prove their irreducibility.</p>
