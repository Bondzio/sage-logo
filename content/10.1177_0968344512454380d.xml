<p>Wouldn’t you like to rewrite a book that you published 25 years ago? Such is the case for Professor George Cassar, who first published this book under the title of <italic>Beyond Courage</italic> in 1985. <italic>Beyond Courage</italic> examined the Canadians during their trial-by-fire battle at Second Ypres in April 1915. It was a solid contribution that fleshed out the complexities of combat and pierced through the fog of war, although it offered few insights into the experience of the Canadian soldier.</p>
<p>Three years later Daniel Dancocks, a gifted Canadian journalist, tackled the same subject, starting with the initial enlistment of Canadians up to the shattering battle that saw 6000 Canadians killed, wounded, or captured in less than a week of fighting, and many who suffered permanent damage from the German unleashing of chlorine gas. Dancocks focused more on the soldiers’ experience and used innovative sources, including over 600 interviews conducted by CBC Radio from the early 1960s. More recently, the battle has been covered in three books: Tim Cook’s <italic>At the Sharp End</italic> (2007), Nathan Greenfield’s <italic>Baptism of Fire</italic> (2007), and Andrew Iarocci’s <italic>Shoestring Soldiers</italic> (2008). All three works offered new perspectives and sources, including more space for the German experience in the battle, with Iarocci’s work, the outgrowth of his PhD dissertation, exploring in great detail the neglected engineers and rear-echelon forces. All of this is to say that, next to the mythologized 1917 battle of Vimy Ridge, Second Ypres is one of the most studied battles in Canadian history.</p>
<p>It is a bit odd that Cassar has decided to reissue his 1985 book, now titled as <italic>Hell in Flanders Fields</italic>. An examination of the notes and sources reveals few additional works from the original, and no new primary source research. The official records in Record Group 9, Records of Militia and Defence, held at the Library and Archives of Canada in Ottawa, appear to be unexamined. Claims of using the CBC records from the early 1960s indicate that Cassar actually employed the polished transcripts from the finished product, 17 one-hour programs, and not the raw material, which contains a wealth of insight into the soldiers’ experience in battle. There is little additional research into British, French, or German archives.</p>
<p>This reviewer is left wondering why this book was published. No doubt the author and publisher hoped to cash in on the relative popularity of the Great War in Canada, which, since the 90th anniversary commemorations from 2006 to 2008, has remained on the cultural and media radar. In the end, <italic>Hell in Flanders Fields</italic> is better than <italic>Beyond Courage</italic>, but not by much, and not enough to see it published in a field that is already crowded.</p>
