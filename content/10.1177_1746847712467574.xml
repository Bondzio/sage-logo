<p><italic>Avatar</italic> (James Cameron, 2009) is a remarkable film that divides audiences and film scholars. While the film was hugely popular, and many ‘coffee table’ fan books and ‘making ofs’ were published, the academic response in comparison was modest, and much writing focused on technological feats.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746847712467574">1</xref></sup> This Special Issue of <italic>animation: an interdisciplinary journal</italic> on James Cameron’s <italic>Avatar</italic> (2009), seeks in a modest way to remedy this.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1746847712467574">2</xref></sup> Guest Editors William Brown and Jenna Ng have brought together an impressive group of authors to address the impact – technological, perceptual, aesthetic and cultural – of James Cameron’s blockbuster film. Their “Guest Editorial: Introduction to <italic>Avatar</italic>” sets the context of their aims and describes thematics of the issue and of the articles. They also mention that “<italic>Avatar</italic> had been gaining media attention since 1994, although it did not get made earlier because the technology had to reach a stage sufficient to manifest the ‘vision’ James Cameron had for the film”.</p>
<p>The hotly anticipated sequels to <italic>Avatar</italic> are in development but again, audiences will have to wait. In an Interview with Phil de Semlyn, producer John Landau stated ““Movies make release dates; release dates don’t make movies”. [de Semlyn’s conclusion was] Reading between the lines, it’s safe to say that we won’t be heading back to Pandora until 2015 at the earliest, with the third instalment likely in 2016 or 2017.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746847712467574">de Semlyen, 2012</xref>) In terms of critical writing and the period of waiting for the next film, Paul Coates has noted<disp-quote>
<p>Theory… occupies a privileged place among film-goers because theorizing is what one does in the barren intervals between good films: once one’s enthusiasm for the last work has died down, one finds oneself stranded in an imageless wilderness, and, left with nothing to think about, one begins to think abstractly. (1995: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With the delay of the two sequels originally planned for release in 2014, audiences and scholars alike are now faced with a ‘barren interval’. We hope this issue will contribute to the growing dialogue and critical debates on the first <italic>Avatar</italic> film, and that you enjoy it much as we did producing it.</p>

<label>1.</label>
<p>A search in the Library of Congress for ‘James Cameron’ and ‘Avatar’ returned just eleven titles, four of which were critical writings. A Project Muse journals search (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://muse.jhu.edu">http://muse.jhu.edu</ext-link>) returned 65 articles, but few specifically on <italic>Avatar.</italic></p></fn>

<p>On a personal note (and as a critical fan), to understand its complexity I suggest <italic>Avatar</italic> requires multiple viewings. I was disappointed at my first 3D cinema experience, and in the meantime having watched the film on DVD over 30 times, its sometimes nuanced ethical, aesthetic and cultural and political qualities become apparent.</p></fn>
