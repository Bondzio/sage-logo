<p>This ambitious project, the <italic>Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaeae/Palaestinae</italic>, aims to collect in multiple volumes all ancient inscriptions from—to borrow the diplomatic language of the title—<italic>Iudaea/Palaestina</italic>. The ﬁrst two volumes have now appeared, in three ‘books’; the ﬁrst volume is published in two parts. These two volumes cover Jerusalem and Caesarea (with the Middle Coast), and each contains over a thousand inscriptions. It is interesting that as recently as 2005/2006, Pieter van der Horst (it seems, following information from Jonathan Price and Hannah Cotton, two of the editors of CII/P) projected that the corpus of inscriptions from the land of Israel <italic>in toto</italic> would amount to ‘1800 or more’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142064X13481410">2006</xref>: 86). The ﬁrst two volumes alone run from 1 to 2160, however, and according to the publisher, there are four more volumes planned: volume III on the South Coast, volume IV on Judaea/Idumea, volume V on the Negev and volume VI covering Galilee, with the publication of the whole corpus intended to be completed by 2018.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X13481410">1</xref></sup> The inscriptions published so far range from the fourth century <sc>bce</sc> (§§609-15) up to the Moslem conquest in 638. Given this chronological sweep, the inscriptions presented appear not only in Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek, but also in Georgian, Armenian and Coptic.</p>
<p>As far as format is concerned, the volumes so far each contain introductions to the geographical locations: the introduction to Jerusalem is an extremely helpful essay collecting together and analysing literary and archaeological evidence within the period; the Caesarea volume also contains briefer introductory essays on Apollonia-Arsuf, Castra Samaritanorum, Dora/Dor, Mikhmoret and Sycamina. Thereafter, the ﬁrst Jerusalem volume is divided (slightly artiﬁcially) into ‘A. Inscriptions of a religious and public character’, ‘B. Funerary inscriptions’, ‘C. Instrumentum domesticum’ and ‘D. Varia’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0142064X13481410">2</xref></sup> The Caesarea volume has a rather more complex arrangement, with 12 subdivisions (labelled A–M, without J!). Each inscription is given a date and carefully introduced (with details about the relevant object’s decoration and dimensions), with text (and apparatus detailing where relevant other editors’ transcriptions), photograph, transliteration and translation, followed by commentary and bibliography. The volumes conclude with indices of personal names and well-designed maps. There are some inscriptions hitherto unpublished (e.g., the ossuary §532).</p>
<p>By comparison with similar publications, the method of presentation in these CII/P volumes compares very favourably. Probably the greatest beneﬁt lies in having photographs accompanying almost every item, rather than at the end of a volume or selectively or not at all. On the other hand, it is a little frustrating that there are not more indices. By comparison with, for example, the Cambridge Hebrew inscriptions project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X13481410">Davies 1991</xref>, 2004), there is no word-in-context concordance in CII/P. The Horbury/Noy collection of Jewish inscriptions of Western Europe and Graeco-Roman Egypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X13481410">Horbury and Noy 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142064X13481410">Noy 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142064X13481410">1995</xref>) contains a great number of indices of notable features, ofﬁces held by those mentioned and other religious and formulaic items of vocabulary. The same extensive range of indices appears in volumes I (Eastern Europe) and III (Syria and Cyprus) of the Inscriptiones Judaicae Orientis series, as one might expect given Noy’s participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X13481410">Noy, Panyatov and Bloedhom 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X13481410">Noy and Bloedhom 2004</xref>); volume II covering Asia Minor, by Walter Ameling (one of the CII/P editors), has a more modest set of indices covering <italic>Personennamen, Datierungen, Geographica und Ethnica, Verba, Grabmult</italic> (a reference to the ﬁne incurred by someone tampering with a grave), <italic>Latein</italic> and <italic>Hebräisch</italic>. One therefore cannot ﬁnd, for example, all the references to ‘qorban’ or to priests in CII/P (though Roman emperors and other kings are separated in the index of names). On the other hand, extensive indices in the cases of Jerusalem and Caesarea under discussion here would have required not merely longer books but additional volumes. The editors do express regret for this absence, and indicate a plan to produce a general index for all the volumes, with an index promised on the Internet in the meantime (I/1.viii). An additional difference between these volumes and other corpora of <italic>Jewish</italic> inscriptions is that the CII/P volumes are organized geographically, rather than on ethnic or religious grounds, and so one sees side by side clearly Jewish inscriptions alongside those of the Roman occupiers—this is <italic>not</italic> a <italic>corpus inscriptionum iudaicarum</italic>, even if, in combination with collections of Jewish inscriptions already published, this series will render <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142064X13481410">Frey (1936/1952)</xref> obsolete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142064X13481410">van der Horst 2006</xref>). (The CII/P editors are therefore able to avoid the knotty question of what constitutes a ‘Jewish inscription’.) As noted, the presence of the photographs of every inscription, alongside the text and discussion, is a distinct advantage of CII/P over parallel projects.</p>
<p>Some of the inscriptions in the corpus will be of greater interest to readers of <italic>JSNT</italic> than will others. The material of most direct relevance to New Testament study comes from the ﬁrst part-volume (Volume I, Part 1, covering Jerusalem up to c. 70 <sc>ce</sc>), since the second Jerusalem volume and most of the Caesarea volume contain rather later inscriptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0142064X13481410">3</xref></sup> One exception to this is the Pontius Pilate inscription (§1277) which provides a correction of Tacitus’s designation of Pilate as a <italic>procurator</italic>: as the inscription conﬁrms, he was a <italic>praefectus</italic>. The editors rightly reject an older view that the <italic>Tiberieum</italic> is a site of emperor worship; however, their alternative, that the building is likely to be a lighthouse (on the strength of a parallel Δρούσιον in Josephus, <italic>AJ</italic> 1.412; 15.336) and that [….]<italic>s</italic> preceding <italic>Tiberieum</italic> is to be restored [<italic>nauti</italic>]<italic>s</italic> (‘for the sailors’), is also somewhat speculative.</p>
<p>The editors naturally include the inscriptions (§§473-78) from the East Talpiot burial cave which has occasioned some excitement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0142064X13481410">4</xref></sup> The combination of an inscription on one of the ossuaries in the cave about ‘Yeshu‘a(?) son of Yehosef’ (§474) with others such as ‘Maria’ (§476) has led to the cave being christened ‘the Jesus family tomb’. The editors are wisely cautious here, however, remarking that a connection with Jesus of Nazareth is ‘highly questionable’ (I/1: 496).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0142064X13481410">5</xref></sup> The names are extremely common, and indeed there is another inscription in the volume with a ‘Jesus son of Joseph’ (§547). The editors apply the same reserve in their assessment of the James ossuary,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0142064X13481410">6</xref></sup> with its inscription ‘Ya‘akov son of Yosef brother of Yeshu‘a’ (§531). This reserve extends both to the authenticity of the ossuary’s inscription, and to its reference to Jesus of Nazareth: ‘if the box is genuine, attribution to the brother of the historical Jesus is groundless’ (I/1.548).</p>
<p>The CII/P inscriptions shed some light on priests in the NT period. The so-called ‘Caiaphas cave’ (§§461-65) contained approximately 63 sets of bones, but only ﬁve individuals are identiﬁed on the ossuaries. That mentioning a certain Yehosef son of Qyp’ (אפיק, or possibly אפוק), on an ossuary containing the remains of a man about 60 years old (§461), has prompted the question of whether this is the Caiaphas of the Gospels. He is never called Joseph in the NT, but is called Ιώσηπος ὁ Καϊάφας and Ιώσηπος ὁ Καϊάφας ἐπικαλούμενος by Josephus (<italic>AJ</italic> 18.35; 18.95).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0142064X13481410">7</xref></sup> Identifying the Yehosef on this ossuary with Caiaphas is risky, however: the editors take particularly seriously the problems of the ‘careless and amateurish’ inscription (though the ossuary design itself is very ornate), and of the coin in the skull of the Miriam in the same cave (§462). A more certain reference to someone at least connected with ‘our’ Caiaphas appears in an ossuary which was presumably made known too late to be included in CII/P: that of ‘Mariam daughter of Yeshua bar Qayafa, priest from Maaziah from Bet Imri’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142064X13481410">Bauckham 2012</xref>). Another ossuary (§534) mentions Caiaphas’s successor, Theophilus (High Priest 37–41 <sc>ce</sc>; cf. Josephus, <italic>AJ</italic> 18.123-24; 19.297). Josephus notes that this Theophilus was deposed by Herod Agrippa, who gave the priesthood to ‘Simon, son of Boethus, also called Cantheras’ (<italic>AJ</italic> 19.297). It could be that this ‘Simon, son of Boethus’ is recorded on an ossuary as ןוטוב ןועמש (§176). The other name attributed to him by Josephus, Κανθηρᾶς, is usually identiﬁed with the name of the turbulent priest םורפק of rabbinic tradition. The Tosefta attributes a kind of woe upon Boethus’s and Qatros’s families to Abba Saul ben Bitnit/Batnith and Abba Yose ben Yohanan: ‘Woe is me because of the House of Boethus. Woe is me because of their staves. Woe is me because of the House of Qatros (םורפק). Woe is me because of their pen’ (<italic>t. Menahot</italic> 13.21; trans. Neusner).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0142064X13481410">8</xref></sup> In a parallel passage, the Talmud explains that the family are high priests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0142064X13481410">9</xref></sup> A stone weight (§674) found in the Burnt House in Jerusalem is inscribed םורתק רבך (‘of the son of Qatros’), perhaps identifying this building as the property of this high-priestly family. Less prestigious priests from the ﬁrst century <sc>bce</sc> appear in §137: ‘This is the tomb and monument of El‘azar, Ḥaniya, Ye‘ezer, Yehuda, Shim‘on (and) Yohanan, sons of Yosef son of ‘Oved (and) Yosef and El‘azar, sons of Ḥaniya, priests of the (family of) Benei (= sons of) Ḥezir.’ They thus belong to the seventeenth priestly course, of Ḥezir (1 Chron. 24.7-18), as opposed to those of the course of Yeshebab, the fourteenth (§368), and Menahem, designated a priest from the twenty-ﬁrst course, the sons of Yakim (§183); the Caiaphas above belonged to Maaziah, the twenty-fourth. (John the Baptist’s father belonged to that of Abijah, the eighth.) It is striking that in a synagogue in Caesarea as late as the fourth or ﬁfth century <sc>ce</sc> an inscription catalogues the priestly courses (§1145).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X13481410">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>qorban</italic> (חברק) appears on several of the Jerusalem ossuary inscriptions in a formulaic manner:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0142064X13481410">11</xref></sup>
<disp-quote>
<p>Whatever beneﬁt a man may derive from this ossuary (is a) qorban to God from him who is in it. (§287)</p>
<p>Any man who derives beneﬁt from it (= the ossuary)—qorban! Any man (who derives beneﬁt from the ossuary)—qorban! Q(orban)! Q(orban)! Q(orban)! (§466)</p>
<p>Ḥananiya and Shalom. Ḥananiya. Any man (who) beneﬁts (from this ossuary)—Qorban! Ḥananiya and Shalom. (§528)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The same applies on the less sensitive matter of the contents of jars. Two instances of this, again from Jerusalem, are supplied in the corpus: one is a handle of a limestone vessel on which is inscribed חברק (§8), and another on a fragment of a jar inscribed ‘Son of Jason, qorban. Q(orban)’ (§643). The abbreviation ‘Q’ here, as well as in §466 (<italic>tris</italic>) above is explained by the statement in the Mishnah: ‘If a man found a vessel and on it was inscribed a <italic>Qof</italic>, this is <italic>Qorban</italic>’ (<italic>m. Ma’aser Sheni</italic> 4.12). As in the Gospels parallels, the ossuaries are marked by a vow, such that they cannot be used for any purpose except for the burial of the ‘author’ of the <italic>qorban</italic>. According to the editors (following Benovitz), the vow would only come into effect on the violation of the instruction, i.e. the ossuary—insofar as it is used by a violator of the vow—becomes a <italic>qorban</italic>. Similarly, the editors take the reference in Mk 7 (and parallels) to refer to any property under the <italic>qorban</italic> vow which parents may receive from the son’s property to become devoted to the temple at the moment of that alien usage (I/1.308). This is not clear-cut, however: it is difﬁcult to decide between this view and the idea that the item marked <italic>qorban</italic> really is thought to be (at least technically) consecrated to God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0142064X13481410">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to some scholars, a historical problem arises in the ‘Render unto Caesar’ episode because of the lack of evidence for denarii in circulation in Judaea in the time of Jesus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0142064X13481410">13</xref></sup> Among the various coins found in Jerusalem from the period, there are few if any denarii, although there is a hoard of coins from near Isﬁya on Mount Carmel which does contain denarii both of Augustus and (to a lesser extent) Tiberius.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0142064X13481410">14</xref></sup> This lack of evidence may be partially mitigated by the epigraphic evidence, if the CII/P editors are correct in their evaluation of it. One long account on a ﬁrst-century <sc>bce</sc> ostracon (§620) and one fragment of a jug (§1102, ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc>?) use the letter D (ך and Δ respectively) in contexts which suggest they are abbreviations of units of currency. The editors refer to Avi-Yonah’s list of abbreviations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X13481410">Avi-Yonah 1940</xref>: 57) to identify the references to denarii in both cases. This might then be an interesting contribution to our understanding of numismatics in the NT period.</p>
<p>One of the most striking features of the inscriptions is the quantity of Greek in Jerusalem, which serves as a constant reminder to resist the logic of statements such as: ‘Since the author wrote in Greek, he may well have resided in a Jewish community outside of Palestine’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0142064X13481410">15</xref></sup> To take the ossuaries as a sample, there are 590 inscribed ossuaries,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0142064X13481410">16</xref></sup> and of these approximately 125 (over one quarter) are basically Greek inscriptions with Greek names; roughly 70 are in Greek with Hebrew names; about 40 are bilingual (or ‘bi-alphabetical’); 20 or so contain Greek names in Hebrew script. Thus about 40 percent of the ossuaries contain Greek script or Greek names. There are also interesting combinations. In the ossuary of the grand-daughter of Theophilos the high priest (§534), the inscription is in Aramaic, with Theophilus’s Greek name written as םולפת; moreover, ‘it is noteworthy that while the inscription is in Aramaic, the title “high priest” remains in Hebrew’ (I/1.551). Latin names also appear, written in Greek (e.g., Gaius, in §20; Secunda, in §171; Rufus, in §385, and various others), but one also ﬁnds a <italic>Gaius</italic> as םואג in §60, and conversely a <italic>Iohana</italic>, הנחוי, in Latin script (§40). There is overall very little Latin in the Jerusalem inscriptions from around the time of Jesus. Many of the Greek names are those which one might regard as conventionally pious, such as Dositheos (§332, 375-76) and Theodoros (§436), but there also appear those with more ‘pagan’ associations such as Eros (§294) and Psyche (§584): given that the names appear on ossuaries of typically Jewish design, they are almost certainly Jewish names, although these last two are unique here in the Jewish onomasticon (I/1.318).</p>
<p>In conclusion, these volumes are, and the series as a whole will be, the deﬁnitive collection of inscriptions from Israel/Palestine for years to come. The ﬁrst two volumes alone are a magniﬁcent achievement, and will prove even more useful if a comprehensive index is later published. This collection should be the ﬁrst port of call for a sober verdict on any inscription which may be of relevance to NT study. In fact, every NT scholar would beneﬁt greatly from idling away a morning or an afternoon going through the texts of these inscriptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0142064X13481410">17</xref></sup></p>
