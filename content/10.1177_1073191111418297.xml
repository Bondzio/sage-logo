<abstract>
<p>Researchers have argued that the investigation of causal interrelationships between symptoms may help explain the high comorbidity rate between certain psychiatric disorders. Clients’ own attributions concerning the causal interrelationships linking the co-occurrence of their symptoms represent data that may inform their clinical case conceptualization, treatment, and psychological theory regarding the etiology of comorbid disorders. The present study developed and evaluated a novel psychological assessment methodology for measuring Perceived Causal Relations (PCR) and examined its psychometric properties as applied to the question of whether posttraumatic stress and anxiety symptoms represent causal risk factors for depressive symptoms in 225 undergraduates. Participants attributed their symptoms of anxiety and posttraumatic reexperiencing as significant causes of their depressive symptoms. Exploratory analyses identified a listing of symptoms reliably attributed as significant causes of other symptoms and functional impairment, as well as a listing of symptoms reliably attributed as significant effects (outcomes) of other symptoms and functional impairment. The PCR method has promise as an idiographic approach to assessing the causes and consequences of comorbid psychiatric symptoms and associated functional impairment. Research is required to assess the relevance and replicate these findings in distinct psychiatric groups experiencing various symptomatic presentations. Future research may also examine PCR ratings associating other individual differences, for example, between measures of history (e.g., life events), life choices, and personality.</p>

<p>The question regarding whether one disorder (“A”) represents a causal risk factor for another disorder (“B”) is partly informed by the simple frequency with which disorders A and B co-occur, dose–response relationships between A and B (e.g., correlation between degrees of severity of A and B), the necessity and sufficiency by which A and B are associated (e.g., removing A tends to reduce/remove B), and the order by which A and B occur (i.e., A precedes B; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191111418297">Kraemer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191111418297">Kraemer, Stice, Kazdin, Offord, &amp; Kupfer, 2001</xref>). In the case of depression and anxiety disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), research findings concerning concurrent prevalence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073191111418297">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>), dimensional symptom severity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191111418297">Dobson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191111418297">Watson, 2009</xref>), treatment outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191111418297">Davis, Barlow, &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>), and sequential comorbidity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191111418297">Belzer &amp; Schneier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191111418297">Mineka, Watson, &amp; Clark, 1998</xref>) strongly suggest that anxiety disorders represent causal risk factors for comorbid depression. These findings are clinically important as they suggest a role for the early assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders in preventing the development and/or progression of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191111418297">Dozois, Seeds, &amp; Collins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191111418297">Garber &amp; Weersing, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191111418297">Mineka et al., 1998</xref>). However, a limitation common to existing psychometric assessment methods is that, aside from simply documenting the presence and severity of anxiety and depression symptoms, current methodologies do not provide any account of why it is that anxiety and depressive symptoms so often co-occur. In other words, existing assessment methodologies do not directly measure the etiological significance of anxiety for depression and vice versa at the idiographic level, and development of such a methodology could provide incremental content validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073191111418297">Haynes &amp; Lench, 2003</xref>) that, in turn, yields further informative theory at the nomothetic level (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111418297">Haynes, Mumma, &amp; Pinson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191111418297">Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1073191111418297">Strauss &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Borsboom, Cramer, and colleagues’ recent “network approach” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191111418297">Borsboom, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111418297">Cramer, Waldrop, van der Maas, &amp; Borsboom, 2010</xref>) to psychometric theory represents a noteworthy development whereby causal interrelations between specific symptoms, rather than broad diagnoses, represent the primary variables of measurement interest. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111418297">Cramer et al. (2010)</xref>, in contrast to classical latent variable (factor analytic) approaches in which symptoms arguably are of interest only as error-laden indicators of a factor or as variables fully explained by the factor, the network approach promotes the careful examination of symptoms in and of their own right, particularly as explanations of the comorbidity frequently observed at the diagnostic level. Specifically, the network approach models the degree to which associations between shared (overlapping) symptoms of different disorders (e.g., concentration problems in both generalized anxiety disorder [GAD] and major depressive disorder [MDD]), coupled with distinct symptoms (e.g., worry in GAD and anhedonia in MDD), mediate diagnostic comorbidity between the two disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111418297">Cramer et al., 2010</xref>). One limitation of the network approach, however, is that it does not accommodate the directionality of cause–effect relationships (e.g., anxiety causing depression more so than vice versa). In addition, the method addresses group-level data only; current approaches cannot be used to assess the causal interrelationships associating symptoms in a single assessment client unless a time series is collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111418297">Haynes et al., 2009</xref>). To direct treatment efforts, an assessment methodology capable of elucidating the causal significance of co-occurring symptoms at the idiographic case level would therefore have significant clinical utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111418297">Haynes et al., 2009</xref>). For example, in an individual with comorbid PTSD and depression, one may question whether his or her intrusive recall of traumatic experiences represents the primary cause of his or her depressive self-referential cognition, low mood, difficulty concentrating, and low motivation or whether each of these symptoms represent largely discrete clinical concerns. One may also ask whether a depressed person’s difficulties at work represent the proximal psychosocial cause of his or her depression (e.g., occupational stress causing depression) or are better conceptualized as a consequence of his or her depression (e.g., depressive symptoms interfering with occupational performance). Development of a psychological assessment methodology capable of addressing such idiographic questions conceivably would provide significant clinical utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111418297">Haynes et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been argued that assessing clients’ own attributions concerning how their anxiety and depression symptoms causally relate can inform clinical case conceptualization, differential diagnosis, and treatment planning. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191111418297">Belzer and Schneier (2004)</xref> wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>Careful assessment of anxiety and depression symptoms and their relationship to each other is important. . . . Do the syndromes wax and wane concurrently, does one seem to lead to the other, or does each of them seem to have a life of its own? . . . <italic>Patients often have beliefs about this that can inform the treatment.</italic> (p. 300, italics added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, although clients’ subjective attributions and objective reality will not always cohere, participants’ symptom perceptions nevertheless are those that principally guide treatment seeking and are therefore important to assess in and of their right.</p>
<p>In this study, we develop and evaluate a psychological assessment methodology that explicitly assesses the extent to which participants regard their symptoms to be causally associated and determine functional impairment; we title our methodology “Perceived Causal Relationship” (PCR) scaling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191111418297">Figure 1</xref>). Simply put, PCR scaling requires participants first to report on the frequency with which they experience various symptoms after which, naturally only for those symptoms reported present, they are asked in regard to each symptom pairing to rate the degree to which they attribute each symptom as the cause of their other symptoms and of their degree of functional impairment. For example, if a client reports symptoms of (1) depression, (2) anxiety, and (3) PTSD are present, but not symptoms of (4) dissociation, the PCR assessment will require him or her to make <italic>n</italic>(<italic>n</italic> − 1) = 3(2) = 6 separate ratings, revealing how much he or she attributes his or her: depression as a cause of his or her (1) anxiety and (2) PTSD, anxiety as a cause of his or her (3) depression and (4) PTSD, and PTSD as a cause of his or her (5) depression and (6) anxiety. In contrast, the participant would not be asked about the causes and effects of dissociative symptoms because dissociative symptoms were not rated present in this case. Should a client also indicate the presence of functional impairment (e.g., interpersonal/occupational problems), he or she would also separately rate how much his or her interpersonal/occupational problems cause his or her depression, anxiety, and PTSD, as well as how much his or her depression anxiety, and PTSD cause his or her interpersonal/occupational problems. Being that the particular symptoms that are reported present will vary across participants, in turn so will the causal association questions that are subsequently indicated, and procedurally the PCR assessment is therefore most efficiently administered via a computerized adaptive testing protocol (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191111418297">Forbey &amp; Ben-Porath, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191111418297">Garb, 2007</xref>). The PCR analytic framework is illustrated with the hypothetical example previously given regarding depression, anxiety, PTSD, and dissociative symptoms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191111418297">Figure 1</xref>. In summary, in the minds of individual clients, PCR assessment data reflect a symptom hierarchy ordered by the symptoms the client regards as being most causative of his or her overall presenting concerns and functional impairment; such data may be used to guide idiographic clinical case conceptualization and treatment efforts for specific clients. Moreover data averaged across clients may inform theoretical models about the typical causes and consequences of comorbid symptomatology at the nomothetic (e.g., diagnostic) level.</p>

On a 0 to 10 scale, he/she would then be asked to indicate how much he/she thought his/her problems with MDE caused his/her problems with ANX (3) and PTSD (5), ANX caused his/her problems with MDE (8) and PTSD (5), and PTSD caused his/her problems with MDE (8) and ANX (6). The results highlighted in circles indicate that he/she regarded his/her symptoms of ANX as a greater cause of his/her symptoms of MDE (8) than vice versa (3). Mean Causal Association scores are calculated by taking the mean down a column, indicating how much a symptom is regarded as a cause of other symptoms on average. Mean Effect Association scores are calculated by taking the mean across a row, indicating how much a symptom is regarded as an effect of other symptoms on average. These scores can be directly compared (e.g., MDE symptoms regarded as a greater effect [8] than cause [4] of other symptoms; squares) or compared with the grande mean (here 5.8, e.g., PTSD symptoms regarded as stronger than average causes [7] and weaker than average effects [5]; diamonds).</p>

<p>The present introductory demonstration of the PCR assessment methodology examines causal associations between symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and their associated features, including symptoms of “complex PTSD” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191111418297">Courtois, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1073191111418297">Scoboria, Ford, Lin, &amp; Frisman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1073191111418297">van der Kolk, Roth, Pelcovitz, Sunday, &amp; Spinazzola, 2005</xref>) and dissociative symptoms, in a convenience sample of 225 undergraduates. We were also particularly interested in determining the causal significance of intrusive memories concerning past stressful and traumatic events for other symptoms of psychopathology following Brewin and colleagues’ findings that intrusive memories are prominent symptoms in mood and anxiety disorders other than PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191111418297">Brewin, Gregory, Lipton, &amp; Burgess, 2010</xref>). We hypothesized that individuals would attribute their anxiety and intrusive memory symptoms as stronger causes of their depressive symptoms than vice versa.</p>

<title>Perceived Causal Relations (PCR) scaling</title>
<p>In the present study, we examined perceived causal relations associating symptoms of major depressive episodes (MDE), PTSD, other anxiety disorders, and related difficulties. The test items (<italic>n</italic> = 40) developed for the present study were intended to comprehensively assess the symptomatology of <italic>DSM-IV</italic> MDE (represented by test items 12-13, 18, 24, 27-30, 32-33) and <italic>DSM-IV</italic> PTSD (represented by test items 5-12, 14-20, 32), excepting PTSD symptom C3 (“inability to recall certain aspects of the traumatic event”) because of the poor psychometric characteristics and factor representation of this symptom as measured by other standard PTSD diagnostic questionnaires and interviews (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191111418297">King, Leskin, King, &amp; Weathers, 1998</xref>). Overlapping symptoms in the diagnosis of PTSD and MDE (i.e., “loss of interest”—Item 12, “concentration difficulties”—Item 18, and “sleep difficulties,” Item 32) were administered only once to reduce redundancy and counted toward symptom totals for both the MDE and PTSD symptom domains. Additional items assessed the presence of the cardinal symptoms of four other anxiety disorders (panic attacks, generalized worry, social anxiety, and agoraphobia) or surveyed the presence and severity of dissociative symptoms (derealization, depersonalization, identity confusion, loss of subjective sense of time, and hearing of voices), self-harm behavior, substance abuse, hypomania, physical health concerns (pain, sexual problems), and functional impairment (related to relationships and school/work performance).</p>
<p>Participants were administered both a short label of each symptom as well as an elaborated definition, with the labels and definitions being phrased with direct reference to the descriptions provided within the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191111418297">APA, 2000</xref>). The wording used for the survey items also benefited from consultations we conducted prior to beginning this study with five outpatients and five clinicians from a specialized clinical service for trauma-related disorders, intended to ensure readability and interpretability of the content (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1073191111418297">Vogt, King, &amp; King, 2004</xref>). A pilot study was also conducted prior to this study, which assessed undergraduate participants’ understanding of the items so as to further ensure their face validity. Pilot participants (<italic>n</italic> = 20) were required to match randomly sorted PCR symptom definitions to independent definitions of each symptom that were copied verbatim from the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191111418297">APA, 2000</xref>). The pilot study demonstrated a high degree of recognition of the present items as descriptions of the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> symptoms, which further substantiated the face validity of the 40 test items we used (<italic>M</italic> hit rate = 84% [i.e., percentage correctly matched], <italic>SD</italic> = 14%).</p>
<p>Completion of the PCR scale itself first required participants to read the list of 40 psychological symptoms-problems, presented one at a time on a computer screen, and answer the following question: “How frequently have you experienced this problem in the past month?” Each symptom was titled by a short label and an elaborated definition, with the symptom labels reported in the tabled results and the elaborated definitions available from the corresponding author. The rating required participants to respond by clicking from a drop-down menu from one of eight response options from “Not at all in the past month” to “Daily or Almost Daily for Most of the Day” that were simply scored 0 to 7 in the present analyses.</p>
<p>Following completion of the frequency ratings, the computer program selected only those symptoms rated present in the previous month (i.e., those symptoms that were rated to occur at least “Once in the past month”) and inserted the symptoms in position to suit the following follow-up causal association question: “How much do you think your problems with [inserting some ‘Symptom X’] CAUSE your problems with [inserting some ‘Symptom Y’]?” Participants were presented with all possible paired permutations of the symptoms that they had reported occurred over the previous month. It is important to emphasize that participants were therefore asked the causal association question in each of its two directional formulations: (a) “How much do you think your problems with [inserting some ‘Symptom X’] CAUSE your problems with [inserting some ‘Symptom Y’]?” and (b) “How much do you think your problems with [inserting some ‘Symptom Y’] CAUSE your problems with [inserting some ‘Symptom X’]?” (Please see the note to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191111418297">Figure 1</xref> for further explanation).</p>
<p>The number of follow-up causal association questions a given participant was presented with was therefore <italic>n</italic>(<italic>n</italic> − 1), where <italic>n</italic> equals the number of symptoms that the participant rated had occurred at least once in the previous month. The maximum possible number of symptoms that could be rated, in the event that a participant rated all 40 symptoms had occurred in the previous month, was therefore 40 × 39 = 1,560. Participants answered each follow-up causal association question by selecting a number from a drop-down menu from 0 to 10, with 0 referring to “Not at all,” 5 referring to “Moderately Cause,” 10 referring to “Strong Cause,” and no other item anchors. Causal associations that were not rated (because of one or both symptoms being rated absent in the previous month) were treated as missing variables at the individual case level.</p>

<title>Internal and convergent validity of the frequency ratings of the PCR items</title>
<p>Provided that the symptom list we used for the PCR scaling analysis represents a new set of survey items, to verify the interpretability of the test items themselves, the alpha coefficient, average interitem correlation, and item–total correlations for its PTSD and MDE frequency ratings were calculated, and summary scores of these items were correlated with the established measures of the same symptoms (PDS and BDI-II) to determine convergent validity. To examine differences between correlations in assessing convergent and discriminant validity, we used the <italic>Z</italic> statistic recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073191111418297">Meng, Rosenthal, and Rubin (1992)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1073191111418297">
<title>Data reduction</title>
<p>Provided that the PCR scale generates a potentially large data matrix (40 symptom frequency scores and up to 1,560 <italic>causal association</italic> scores may be collected), the number of dependent measures appropriated to statistical analysis was reduced by calculating, for each of the 40 symptoms, a <italic>Mean Causal Association</italic> and <italic>Mean Effect Association</italic> score (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191111418297">Figure 1</xref>). Note that the sample sizes on which such statistics are based vary with the number of participants who reported the symptom occurred over the previous month because, as previously stated, <italic>causal associations</italic> that were not rated due to one or both symptoms not being present in the previous month (i.e., in terms of frequency ratings) were treated as missing variables at the individual case level. The <italic>Mean Causal Association</italic> score for a particular symptom was the average <italic>causal association</italic> score the symptom received across up to all 39 symptoms with which it was compared when it represented “Symptom X” in the question: “How much do you think your problems with [Symptom X] CAUSE your problems with [Symptom Y]?” In comparison, the <italic>Mean Effect Association</italic> score for a particular symptom was the average <italic>causal association</italic> score the symptom received when it represented “Symptom Y” in the same question. Conceptually then, the mean causal and mean effect association scores represent the degree to which a symptom was regarded, on average, as causing all other symptoms versus being caused by all other symptoms, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191111418297">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>As a further approach to data reduction that acknowledges the potential for error associated with analyses conducted at the item level, in order to examine the bidirectional causal associations between anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic reexperiencing symptoms in a hypothesis-driven approach, causal association scores were averaged across the causal association ratings for the four anxiety symptoms (Items 1-4), the nine MDE symptoms (MDE; Items 12-13, 18, 24, 27-30, 32-33), and the five PTSD reexperiencing (<italic>DSM-IV</italic> PTSD criteria “B”) symptoms (Items 5-9).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1073191111418297">
<title>Inferential tests of causal association ratings</title>
<p>Our study evaluated two inferential hypotheses intended as tests of the construct validity of the PCR assessment methodology. First, we predicted that anxiety symptoms will show high <italic>Causal</italic> associations for MDE symptoms and that anxiety symptoms will show higher <italic>Causal</italic> associations for MDE symptoms than will MDE symptoms show <italic>Causal</italic> associations for anxiety symptoms. Similarly, we predicted that PTSD reexperiencing symptoms will also show high <italic>Causal</italic> associations for MDE symptoms and that PTSD reexperiencing symptoms will show higher <italic>Causal</italic> associations for MDE symptoms than vice versa. These hypotheses were formulated as tests of the construct validity of PCR scaling following the notion that the construct validity of a novel testing instrument or methodology can be partly adjudicated to the degree that analyses of the internal properties of the measure/approach accord with (and in turn inform) the theory on which the measure/approach is based (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191111418297">Chronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191111418297">Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1073191111418297">Strauss &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1073191111418297">
<title>Exploratory Tests of causal association ratings</title>
<p>Consistent with the network model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191111418297">Borsboom, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111418297">Cramer et al., 2010</xref>), we predicted that participants would view their symptoms as significantly causally associated (operationally defined as a grande mean causal association score significantly greater than zero on average, indicating symptoms were perceived to be causally associated more than “not at all” on average). Furthermore, to examine the discriminant validity of assessing symptom causal associations in comparison with simply assessing the frequency of symptoms, the variance accounted for by symptom frequency ratings in predicting causal and effect associations was examined.</p>
<p>Finally, we explored which of the 40 symptoms administered had (a) higher-than-average <italic>Causal</italic> association ratings (i.e., relative to the grande mean), (b) higher-than-average <italic>Effect</italic> association ratings (i.e., relative to the grande mean), (c) higher-than-average <italic>Causal</italic> association ratings <italic>relative to Effect</italic> association ratings, and vice versa (i.e., via direct comparisons), and finally (d) higher-than-average <italic>Causal</italic> association ratings specifically for the social and occupational impairment items (Items 36 and 37, respectively), and higher-than-average <italic>Effect</italic> association ratings specifically for the social and occupational impairment items. As opposed to being tests of existing theory, these tests are inherently exploratory and can be viewed as theory-generative applications of PCR scaling. Exploratory tests conducted across all 40 symptoms were therefore interpreted as statistically significant only after Bonferonni correction (<italic>p</italic>
<sub>critical</sub> = .05/40 = .00125). For clarity and brevity in the presentation of our results for exploratory tests, when discussing results particular to a given symptom (i.e., PCR item), we give the item number in brackets to afford ease of reference to the associated <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191111418297">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191111418297">2</xref> where the descriptive and inferential statistics are then fully reported.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section14-1073191111418297">
<title>Symptom Characteristics of the Sample: PDS and BDI-II</title>
<p>Fifty-eight percent (<italic>n</italic> = 128) of the sample reported that they had experienced at least one of the 11 index traumatic events listed on the PDS, with the number of events experienced by participants ranging from zero to six (<italic>M</italic> = 1.17, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.35). Including events described in the PDS “other traumatic events” category (i.e., PDS Item 13) increased the proportion of trauma-exposed individuals to 64% (<italic>n</italic> = 141). Trauma exposure was variably associated with functional impairment, with 42% (<italic>n</italic> = 59) indicating that the event(s) ultimately caused no significant functional impairment, 14% (<italic>n</italic> = 20) indicating that the event(s) caused impairment in a single, specific area of their life, and the remaining 44% (<italic>n</italic> = 61) indicating that the event(s) caused impairment in multiple areas of life. Notably, 22% (<italic>n</italic> = 30) reported specifically that the event(s) interfered with their “overall level of functioning in <italic>all</italic> areas of life.”</p>
<p>Across the full sample of individuals who reported experiencing a traumatic event and henceforth reported on associated <italic>current</italic> (last month) PTSD symptoms, the mean PDS symptom severity score ranged from 0 to 44 (<italic>M</italic> = 9.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.91). Twenty-five percent of the trauma-exposed sample (<italic>n</italic> = 24, 11% of the total sample) met full criteria for PTSD according to the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191111418297">APA, 2000</xref>) as implemented by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191111418297">Ehring et al. (2007)</xref> cluster-scoring plus minimum total score of 18 algorithm. Comparably, across the full sample, BDI-II scores ranged from 0 to 48 (<italic>M</italic> = 11.09, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.66). Applying the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191111418297">Dozois et al. (1998)</xref> criteria, 66% of the total sample (<italic>n</italic> = 147) were classified as “nondysphoric,” 20% (<italic>n</italic> = 45) were considered “mildly dysphoric,” and the remaining 13% (<italic>n</italic> = 30) were considered “moderately-to-severely dysphoric.” Finally, with a view toward assessing comorbid PTSD and MDD in this sample, of the 24 individuals who met criteria for PTSD on the PDS, 13 (54%) were classified as “moderately-to-severely dysphoric” on the BDI-II; of those classified “moderately-to-severely dysphoric” on the BDI-II, 43% (13/30) thus met criteria for PTSD on the PDS.</p>

<title>Internal and Convergent Validity of the Frequency Ratings of the PCR Items</title>
<p>Item-level descriptive statistics for all 40 PCR symptoms-problem frequency ratings are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191111418297">Table 1</xref>. The number of symptoms endorsed ranged between 0 and 36 (<italic>M</italic> = 16.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.75). Accordingly, the number of causal association questions rated ranged between 0 and 1,260 (<italic>M</italic> = 336.11, <italic>SD</italic> = 312.81). Participants required between 3 and 36 minutes to complete the PCR assessment (<italic>M</italic> = 22.66, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.96), and no participant aborted testing. As would be expected of the PCR method, the time participants required to complete the PCR assessment was strongly predicted by the number of symptoms participants endorsed, <italic>r</italic> = .73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Coefficient alpha for the <italic>frequency</italic> ratings of the 16 PTSD items (5-12, 14-20, 32) on the PCR scale was .90, interitem correlations ranged from .10 to .73 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.37, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.14), and item–total correlations ranged from .37 to .68 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.10). PCR-PTSD frequency scores were significantly correlated with both PDS-scores, <italic>r</italic>(140) = .68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and BDI-II-scores, <italic>r</italic>(222) = .69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The correlation between PCR-PTSD frequency scores and BDI-II scores was of similar magnitude to the correlation between PDS scores and BDI-II scores, <italic>r</italic>(140) = .62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>Z</italic> = 1.45, <italic>p</italic> = .14. Overall then, these analyses support the internal and convergent validity of the PCR-PTSD frequency items and the high correlation between symptoms of PTSD and depression.</p>
<p>Coefficient alpha for the <italic>frequency</italic> ratings of the 10 MDE items (12-13, 18, 24, 27-30, 32-33) on the PCR scale was .88, interitem correlations ranged from .23 to .70 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.43, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.12), and item–total correlations ranged from .40 to .72 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.62, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.09). PCR-MDE <italic>frequency</italic> scores were significantly correlated with both BDI-II scores, <italic>r</italic>(222) = .77, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and PDS scores, <italic>r</italic>(140) = .53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but correlated more strongly with BDI-II than PDS scores, <italic>Z</italic> = 4.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In summary, these analyses support the internal and convergent validity of the PCR-MDE <italic>frequency</italic> items.</p>
<p>Finally, coefficient alpha for the <italic>frequency</italic> ratings of the four anxiety items (1-4) on the PCR scale was .77, interitem correlations ranged from .36 to .65 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.46, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.12), and item–total correlations ranged from .69 to .84 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.77, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.06). Frequency ratings for the anxiety symptoms were correlated with frequency ratings for the MDE symptoms, <italic>r</italic>(224) = .69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and PTSD symptoms, <italic>r</italic>(224) = .66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>

<p>The grande mean causal association score ranged from 0.00 to 7.44 (<italic>M</italic> = 2.64, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.87) across participants, which is significantly greater than zero, <italic>t</italic>(220) = 21.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, a zero value denoting “no causal association.” These results indicate participants regard their symptoms as significantly causally associated, although a significant degree of variation exists across participants concerning how much they view their symptoms to be causally associated.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Researchers have recently argued that the investigation of causal interrelationships between symptoms may help explain the high comorbidity rate between certain psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191111418297">Borsboom, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111418297">Cramer et al., 2010</xref>). For example, high social anxiety may provoke interpersonal avoidance and loneliness, in turn leading to depression, whereas the intrusive recall of traumatic experiences can provoke depressive shame and guilt. Although causal associations between symptoms such as these are often evident when clients are interviewed, we are aware of no structured, systematic psychological assessment methodology to support the measurement of causal associations between symptoms, or between symptoms and functional impairment, that does not rely on the collection of a time series (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111418297">Haynes et al., 2009</xref>). The present study therefore developed an assessment methodology for measuring participants’ own attributions concerning the direction and magnitude of cause–effect relations between their symptoms and degree of impairment; we titled our methodology <italic>Perceived Causal Relationship</italic> (PCR) scaling. In the present study, we evaluated the appropriateness of PCR scaling as an assessment method for investigating whether anxiety and PTSD reexperiencing symptoms would be attributed as causally associated with depressive symptoms. We also explored which of a number of depression, anxiety, and PTSD-related symptoms were most significantly causally associated with one another and with functional impairment.</p>

<title>Causal Associations Between Anxiety, PTSD Reexperiencing, and Depression</title>
<p>As predicted, our results demonstrate that participants tend to attribute their anxiety and PTSD reexperiencing symptoms as significant causes of their depressive symptoms. Participants also tend to regard their anxiety and PTSD reexperiencing symptoms as stronger causes of their depressive symptoms than vice versa. These directional results are consistent with clinical studies, suggesting that anxiety disorders represent significant causal risk factors for depression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191111418297">Belzer &amp; Schneier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191111418297">Mineka et al., 1998</xref>) and that intrusive traumatic memories are prominent symptoms in depressed individuals (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191111418297">Brewin et al., 2010</xref>). The degree to which cognitive and behavioral avoidance of anxiety and trauma reminders may partly mediate these effects by in turn reducing opportunities for rewarding and pleasant interactions with others is an important question for future research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073191111418297">Kanter, Manos, Bowe, Baruch, &amp; Rusch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191111418297">Manos, Kanter, &amp; Busch, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The causal associations identified between anxiety, PTSD, and depression in this study partly serve to validate PCR scaling as an assessment methodology, given that such results are consistent with predictions derived from the clinical literature, thus providing a suitable nomological network for construct validity testing of PCR scaling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191111418297">Chronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191111418297">Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1073191111418297">Strauss &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>). To the extent that participants regard their depression symptoms as strongly causally affected by their anxiety symptoms and intrusive traumatic memories, clinicians may be advised to assess whether a therapeutic resolution of anxiety disorders and past traumatic events via exposure, cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, and/or other structured interventions might represent a viable indirect intervention for associated depression in comorbid cases (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191111418297">Garber &amp; Weersing, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Future research should simultaneously examine the causal significance of anxiety for depression, depression for anxiety, and select anxiety disorders for other anxiety disorders in individuals diagnosed with distinct and comorbid anxiety disorders. By comparison, limitations of the present study included that the clinical significance of the anxiety symptomatology experienced by the current sample was not confirmed, that only select types of anxiety were assessed, and that the different categories of anxiety that <italic>were</italic> assessed were measured at the item-level only and therefore could not be differentiated reliably independent of measurement error.</p>
<p>Within the present study, perceived directional causal associations between anxiety and depression, on the one hand, and depression and anxiety, on the other, were highly correlated, suggesting that the causal interrelationships linking these symptom domains are strongly bidirectional. These findings are consistent with and support the increasing emphasis on developing unified prevention programs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191111418297">Dozois et al., 2009</xref>) and treatments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191111418297">Barlow, Allen, &amp; Choate, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191111418297">Brown &amp; Barlow, 2008</xref>) for anxiety disorders and depression, as well as the emphasis on investigating the symptoms of general distress that are common between the disorders and may partly mediate comorbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111418297">Cramer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191111418297">Watson, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section25-1073191111418297">
<title>Exploring the Cause-and-Effect Associations Between Symptoms and Between Symptoms and Functional Impairment</title>
<p>The present study also explored the results PCR scaling yields concerning participants’ attributions about the causal associations potentially linking a range of common psychological symptoms with each other and with functional impairment. A fundamental, general finding was that participants regard their symptoms as significantly causally associated, and the more they regard a symptom to be a significant <italic>cause</italic> of other symptoms, the more they also regard that symptom to be a significant <italic>effect</italic> of other symptoms. These findings strongly suggest that attributed causal interrelationships among symptoms are for the most part bidirectional. An important qualification of these findings in the present sample, however, is that they may be largely determined by a certain subset of highly frequent and causally associated symptoms including symptoms of anxiety disorders, depression, and PTSD. Future studies are therefore needed to examine PCR ratings for symptoms expected to be perceived as less causally related to clients. Exploratory structural analyses (e.g., factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis) of the causal association ratings at the level of individual items may also resolve this issue in the future; however, such analyses will need to address issues of missing data in PCR analyses. Specifically, structural analyses might be feasible only in samples experiencing nearly all the symptoms of interest because symptoms that are not endorsed as present are treated as missing variables in a PCR analysis and therefore cannot contribute to the structures obtained.</p>
<p>Two of the most novel results yielded by PCR scaling include its listing of symptoms attributed as high causes and high effects of other symptoms and listing of symptoms attributed more versus less as causes in comparison with effects of other symptoms (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191111418297">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1073191111418297">Figure 2</xref>). Several symptoms were attributed as higher causes than effects of other symptoms, including anxiety symptoms, intrusive recall of traumatic events, and dysphoric mood and cognition (feeling worthless, guilt and/or shame). In contrast, difficulties with thinking and concentrating, as well as specific behavioral (i.e., agitation, slowing down) and physiological symptoms of depression (i.e., fatigue, sleep and eating disturbance) were principally attributed as effects rather than causes of other symptoms. Comparison of symptoms as such, and with the grande means, effectively yields a two-dimensional classification of symptoms in terms of their high versus low cause versus effect status (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1073191111418297">Figure 2</xref>). Distinguishing between high causal versus high effect symptoms may provide a useful heuristic for the analysis of comorbid symptomatology that is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191111418297">Borsboom’s (2008)</xref> concepts of “central” (i.e., causal) and “peripheral” (i.e., effect) symptoms, respectively. An additional important finding rendered by PCR scaling, particularly from a clinical practice perspective, is its characterization of the symptoms attributed as most causally associated with social and occupational impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191111418297">Mullins-Sweatt &amp; Widiger, 2009</xref>). In short, the present study found that, consistent with the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> assumptions, social and occupational impairment is more strongly regarded as an effect than a cause of psychological symptoms, although causal associations linking functional impairment with symptoms were again highly correlated suggesting perceived bidirectionality.</p>

<title>Limitations and Considerations of PCR Scaling in Clinical Assessment</title>
<p>The PCR assessment methodology developed in this study may have promise as a tool for studying the etiologies that link the co-occurrence of particular psychological symptoms and, in turn, comorbidity at the diagnostic level. Nevertheless, limits of this approach are apparent, perhaps the most obvious of which is that certain psychiatric patients may lack insight into the causes of their symptoms, thereby calling into question the objective accuracy of their judgments regarding the causal associations that link their symptoms. Future studies might address this issue by assessing clients’ subjective degree of confidence that their ratings accurately represent their symptomatology, as well as evaluating the interrater reliability of PCR ratings, such as by comparing client’s responses to those provided about them by individuals with whom they are familiar (e.g., treating clinicians). Studies may also assess the predictive validity of PCR scaling by examining PCR ratings as predictors of the temporal variability of symptoms measured via ecological momentary assessment (EMA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111418297">Haynes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191111418297">Shiffman, Stone, &amp; Hufford, 2008</xref>). Future research directions also include the analysis of symptom content not focused on here, including high-risk behaviors (e.g., symptoms that may causally relate with substance abuse, self-harm, suicidality, and reckless behavior), and nonsymptom variables (e.g., life history, personality). Studies may also examine not only pairwise causal associations but also three-variable mediation analyses (e.g., whether the causal association between two variables <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> is mediated by the causal associations each of these variables exhibit with a third variable <italic>Z</italic>; i.e., <italic>X</italic>–<italic>Z</italic> and <italic>Y</italic>–<italic>Z</italic>). A limitation of the present study also includes that its generalizability to populations with differing gender distributions, ages, education levels, and symptom characteristics is unknown. Clearly, the PCR method requires application to carefully diagnosed clinical samples before any firm conclusions about the perceived causality linking symptom co-occurrences in psychiatric patients can be made. We suggest that researchers examine the validity of the PCR approach in characterizing subjects experiencing multiple symptoms, such as is often the case in individuals with complex trauma histories. At the same time, the PCR assessor may need to judiciously limit the number of symptoms submitted to analysis for a PCR assessment not to be too lengthy to be feasible in highly symptomatic subjects.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Individuals presenting for psychological assessment often have multiple comorbid psychiatric disorders diagnosed on the basis of the occurrence of a heterogeneous set of cognitive, affective, behavioral, and physiological symptoms. However, often little is known about the causal significance relating specific symptom co-occurrences or relating specific symptoms to functional impairment. The present research developed and evaluated a method for investigating clients’ own attributions about such concerns in a convenience sample of young adults, linking symptoms of traumatic stress and anxiety to depressive symptoms and functional impairment in perceived causal directions. It is hoped that the present research will be followed by additional studies investigating the causes, consequences, and clinical significance of particular patterns of perceived symptom causal relationships in various psychiatric disorders.</p>
