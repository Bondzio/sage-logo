<p>Now in its Fifth Edition, <italic>Social Work Treatment: Interlocking Theoretical Approaches</italic> is a comprehensive book describing 36 theoretical approaches, in addition to thoughtful introductory and concluding chapters written by the editor. An expert group of social work educators and practitioners was assembled to contribute to each chapter. The subtitle for the book was aptly named as the chapters weave together the full tapestry of theoretical approaches, from the well established to emerging, relevant to social work students and practitioners. This new edition includes a handy illustrated chart in the preface and on the inside of the book jacket consisting of five dimensions (“principal time orientation, human nature, importance of diversity, risk, and empirical strength”) to orient readers to the essential strengths and weaknesses of each approach. While useful as a tool to quickly compare the theories in this book, it would have been helpful to further categorize the empirical basis for each theory according to the quality of research evidence rather than just the cumulative amount of research available as some of the theoretical approaches are less grounded in empirical evidence and should be viewed with caution and some skepticism. Each chapter also contains excellent reference lists for those interested in reading original sources. The historical roots of social work from such diverse perspectives as psychology, sociology, anthropology, child development, education, and community-organizing provide a foundation for many of the theories described in this book and not surprisingly, a number of the original references are shared among the various theories. Readers interested in the foundation of the social work profession will likely appreciate many of the chapters, such as the chapter describing the development of functional theory as it progressed at the turn of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Readers should keep in mind that some of theoretical approaches require advanced, specialized training beyond the coursework offered in the standard curriculum and elective courses in most social work programs. For example, to develop competency in Strategic Therapy, one needs specific training, practice, and supervision, and certification in Transactional Analysis “takes up to 7 years to complete” (p. 535). This has implications for the dissemination of research-supported practices, particularly around the degree to which social workers seek out and complete such training, whether or not agencies adopt research-supported treatments, and the difficulty in measuring adherence and fidelity to a particular theoretical approach.</p>
<p>This volume has clear application to social work education and practice and is especially appropriate for students in foundation-level social work theory courses and practicing social work clinicians, as well as readers of this journal. Despite the theoretical “plurality” marking the social work profession exemplified in the book, a number of core elements associated with successful treatment and clinical practice are evident. For instance, self-efficacy theory is incorporated into the principles of motivational interviewing (MI)—a research-supported technique for substance abuse treatment included in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices (NREPP). Other core elements include genuine regard, empathy and respect for autonomy, a supportive relationship, and an appreciation of the person-in-environment framework valued by social work. Since the previous edition of this book, the landscape of theoretical approaches in social work reflects a process of letting many flowers bloom. Hopefully this book will inspire others to continue testing, refining, and perhaps pruning the theoretical approaches in the quest for efficacious and effective social work treatments. Overall, the book is a rich resource for educators, students, clinician–researchers, and clinicians who want to understand the theoretical basis of the profession.</p>
