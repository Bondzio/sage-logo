<abstract>
<p>Microfibrillated cellulose consists of nanoscale bundles of elementary microfibrils prepared, e.g. by the defibrillation of delignified wood pulp fibres in high-pressure homogenizers. In this study, microfibrillated cellulose was used to reinforce a thermoset starch plastic. The starch was modified with allyl glycidyl ether with a degree of substitution of 1.3, which was further hydrolyzed with α-amylase for 18 h yielding significantly improved processing properties. Dry premixes of all constituents were prepared by a stepwise drying process before sample manufacturing. The composite was cured by ethylene glycol dimethacrylate initiated with benzoyl peroxide during compression moulding at 150°C. Scanning electron microscopy revealed some degree of porosity in the samples, where the dispersed microfibrillated cellulose network was detectable. Microfibrillated cellulose, even in relatively small additions (2 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt%), resulted in composites with rather good hygromechanical properties. The ultimate strength increased with microfibrillated cellulose content and reached values of comparable composites with 40 wt% softwood fibre. Importantly, the dimensional stability in water was much improved compared to similar composites reinforced with substantially larger weight fractions of softwood fibres.</p>

<p>Along with the ever-growing attention for environmental pollution and exhausting of petroleum, it is more and more attractive to develop biodegradable and renewable composites based on renewable natural resources like starch matrix and cellulose fibre. Under the action of high temperature and shear, starch with a plasticizer or other chemical blend can be processed into a mouldable thermoplastic starch (TPS). To eliminate the disadvantages such as water absorption, poor mechanical properties and processability, starch needs to be chemically modified or blended with plasticizers or other hydrophobic synthetic polymers. The polymers used to blend with starch include poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312437000">1</xref></sup> poly(3-hydroxybutyrate),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312437000">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312437000">3</xref></sup> polycaprolactone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312437000">4</xref></sup> polybutylene succinate adipate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312437000">5</xref></sup> LDPE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312437000">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312437000">7</xref></sup> poly(lactic acid),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312437000">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312437000">9</xref></sup> polyethylene-octene elastomer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312437000">10</xref></sup> polybutylene succinate, konjac glucomannan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312437000">11</xref></sup> and lignosulfonate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312437000">12</xref></sup> However, most polymers are intrinsically hydrophobic and are thermodynamically immiscible with starch leading to phase separation and often poorer mechanical properties.</p>
<p>Today, natural fibre composites are realistic alternatives to glass and carbon fibre-reinforced composites in many applications. The use of plastic composites based on natural fibres as reinforcement has dramatically increased in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312437000">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312437000">14</xref></sup> Advantages of natural fibres over traditional reinforcing fibres such as glass and carbon are low cost, low density, high toughness, acceptable specific strength properties, enhanced energy recovery and biodegradability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312437000">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312437000">16</xref></sup> Today, a renaissance in the use of natural fibres as reinforcements in technical applications is taking place mainly in the automotive and packaging industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312437000">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312437000">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, a microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) was adopted to reinforce a thermoset allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) modified starch matrix, which was produced according to our earlier work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312437000">19</xref></sup> The study showed that the neat thermoset matrix possessed good strength properties which where further improved by softwood fibre reinforcement. The mechanical properties improved by increased weight fraction of fibre but at the same time the water adsorption increased. MFC was first prepared by Turbak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312437000">20</xref></sup> in the early 1980s. Recently, the interest of applying MFC as reinforcement in polymer matrices has much increased and has also been reviewed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312437000">21</xref></sup> The material consists of nanoscale bundles of microfibrils, which form entangled networks. MFC is normally prepared by the delamination of delignified wood fibres in high-pressure homogenizers. The diameter of the MFC manufactured from Scandinavian softwood pulp is approximately 17–30 nm and the length is 70 nm–1 µm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312437000">22</xref></sup> The high specific strength of MFC enables strong composite materials to be manufactured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312437000">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312437000">26</xref></sup> In most studies, aqueous MFC slurries have been transformed into dry non-woven densely consolidated sheets which has optionally been further impregnated by a highly diluted thermosetting resin. The vast majority of the research deals with MFC–polymer films. The MFC composite film preparation usually consists of casting water-based MFC/polymer/plasticizer slurries with low solid contents requiring long evaporation times. Dufresne and Vignon have shown the very important aspect of decreased water sensitivity in starch-based composite films filled with MFC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998312437000">27</xref></sup> Thus, there is very limited information on how nanodimensional MFC acts as reinforcement in thicker constructs and how it compares with more traditional wood fibres.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to prepare thicker biocomposite structures, other than casted film morphologies, based on an enzyme hydrolyzed AGE-starch (AGE-modified starch) and MFC by compression moulding. The goal is to further evaluate the hygromechanical properties of the composites in terms of Young’s modulus and ultimate strength in a three-point bending test and to study the dimensional stability and water sensitivity during water absorption and the interface between the matrix and fibres.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021998312437000"><title>Composite preparation and curing of 2 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt% MFC-reinforced starch composites</title>
<p>The general procedure to prepare the 2 wt% MFC composite is given. The modified starch (Mod-St) was prepared according to a previous work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312437000">19</xref></sup> Native potato starch was modified with AGE under alkaline aqueous conditions with a molar ratio of AGU:AGE = 1:3 for 24 h at 85°C. The reaction solution was cooled to 45°C, neutralized with hydrochloric acid to pH 5.5–6.5, and then hydrolyzed with α-amylase for 18 h. The preparation of softwood fibre-reinforced composites is reported in Duanmu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312437000">19</xref></sup> To a 50-mL beaker with 5.15 g of aqueous 2 wt% MFC slurry, 5 mL of ethanol and 3.5 g starch (2 wt% MFC-reinforced composite) were added while stirring with a magnetic stirrer. After the modified starch was homogeneously dispersed in the solution, the mixture was heated to 80°C and air was blown into the beaker to enhance the evaporation of water and ethanol. After 6 mL of water/ethanol was evaporated, the mixture was further dried in a vacuum oven (133 Pa) at 80°C until constant weight was obtained. An amount of 10 mL of ethanol was added to the beaker and stirred with a magnetic stirrer until the mixture was homogeneously redispersed, and EGDMA, 1.47 g containing 0.07 g BPO (2 wt% of starch), was added to the mixture while stirring. The mixture was heated to 45°C and air was blown into the dispersion to ease the evaporation of the ethanol. After 8 mL of ethanol/water was evaporated, the mixture was further dried in a vacuum oven (133 Pa) at 45°C until constant weight was obtained. Dried premix (0.4 g) was placed into a steel mould, which was placed between the heating plates of a pressing apparatus preheated to 150°C. The composite sample was cured by applying a 150 bar pressure (according to the used Carver press machine) for 10 min.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0021998312437000"><title>Measurements of mechanical properties</title>
<p>Ten rectangular bars (12°× 3°× 3 mm<sup>3</sup>) of each composite, namely 2 wt% and 5 wt% MFC composites and fifteen of 10 wt% MFC composite, were manufactured. The cut surfaces were polished with 1600 grit silicon carbide paper. The test samples were conditioned at 43.2% relative humidity (saturated K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> aqueous) for 1 week and at ambient condition (Turku, Finland, June–October 2008) for 4 months at room temperature prior to the mechanical test. The ambient condition is estimated to be 60–70% relative humidity.</p>
<p>For the mechanical tests, each composite was dried in a vacuum oven (133 Pa) at 50°C for 24 h before placed at 43.2% humidity, ambient conditions or immersed into water. Five specimens each conditioned at 43.2% humidity or ambient conditions were subjected to a three-point bending test in the in-plane direction. Five specimens of 10 wt% MFC composite conditioned at ambient condition were tested in the out-of-plane condition. A Minimat 2000 microtensile machine was used with a 200-N load cell and a deformation rate of 0.5 mm/min. Because of the dimensions of the discs from which the rectangular specimens were machined, the span to height ratio is not exceedingly high. Bernoulli–Euler beams were therefore not considered to determine the flexural Young’s modulus and strength.</p>
<p>The in-plane Young’s modulus was calculated according Timoshenko beam theory with the following formula:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998312437000">28</xref></sup>

<p>It should be noted that the specimens can be tested in two directions, namely in-plane (also termed flatwise) and out-of-plane (also termed edgewise), depending on if the load is applied in the plane of the compression-moulded disc or out of its plane. The stiffness should be the same in the two directions for slender beams, but the strength may be different since the anisotropic fibre orientation from the compression moulding process will induce different crack paths. This difference is generally recognized in impact testing of composites and flexural strength of layered wood materials.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0021998312437000"><title>Field-emission scanning electron microscopy</title>
<p>Hitachi S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was used to image dried samples of MFC/starch which were initially submerged into liquid nitrogen, frozen and subsequently fractured in order to achieve a clean cross-section surface for imaging. Cross-sections were mounted into a split mount holder and then coated with a layer of 2 nm Au/Pd in a Cressington 208HR high-resolution sputter coater. Prepared samples were kept in a desiccator prior to further analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0021998312437000"><title>Composite preparation</title>
<p>Enzymatically degraded AGE-modified starches with a degree of substitution (DS) of 1.3 were manufactured into MFC-reinforced thermoset composites using EGDMA as crosslinker and BPO as initiator. The amount of crosslinker (EGDMA) was adjusted according to available allylic double bonds and was used in a molar ratio of 0.5:1 and BPO was applied in a constant 2 wt% of the modified starch matrix, i.e. Mod-St. The MFC content in the composites is 0 wt%, 2 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt%.</p>
<p>Fibre length degradation during processing can be neglected, since the fibres were treated gently during manufacture of the composites.</p>
<p>In the composite preparation, it was most important to produce homogeneous premixes of the hydrolyzed modified starch, MFC, crosslinker (EGDMA) and initiator (BPO). The applied MFC comes in a 2 wt% water solution and dried MFC network will not be re-dispersed homogeneously in water by stirring. Substantial amounts of water will be present during the Mod-St-MFC composite preparation which evidently will provide some problems when drying the premix. However, the water also enhances the starch matrix dissolution and improves its homogeneous mixing with MFC. Therefore, a first solvent exchange was performed by adding Mod-St and ethanol to the water solution of MFC before it was partially dried. However, evaporating the water/ethanol solution from modified starch and MFC at a temperature below 60°C is time consuming and not acceptable for keeping the cross-linking agent EGDMA in the premix. Thus, the solution of MFC, ethanol and the Mod-St was first dried at 80°C in a vacuum oven (133 Pa), without EGDMA, to remove roughly 80–90% of the solvents and then re-disperse it in additional ethanol. Then, the crosslinker EGDMA and initiator BPO were added in ethanol to the ethanolic solution of Mod-St and MFC. The solution, now mainly consisting of ethanol, could now readily be evaporated to dryness in a vacuum oven (133 Pa) at 45°C in 40 min reducing the risk for unintended EGDMA removal.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0021998312437000"><title>Interface and fibre dispersion</title>
<p>FE-SEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312437000">Figure 1</xref>) showed the presence of some pores in the fracture surfaces of MFC-reinforced samples. Similar low porosity is also found in neat matrix samples (not shown). The measured density of neat sample is 1452 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and the composites are 1435 kg/m<sup>3</sup> (2%MFC), 1440 kg/m<sup>3</sup> (5%MFC) and 1452 kg/m<sup>3</sup> (10%MFC). The density of MFC can be approximated to 1450 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312437000">26</xref></sup> Consequently, the volume fractions of pores (air- or gas-filled voids) induced to the composites by adding MFC were negligible. The MFC appears not to have induced any additional voids in the starch.

<p>In the FE-SEM images, dispersed MFC networks were mainly observed in the pores and at indentation marks from where sodium crystal remnants have been detached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312437000">Figures 1(c)</xref> an<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312437000">d</xref> (d), respectively). The visible pores likely originate from entrapped and evaporated water. The overall appearance of the fracture surfaces is coarser in composites with a higher MFC content indicating a reasonable MFC dispersion in the whole composite. A lack of direct detection of MFC by FE-SEM other than in the pores and under detached sodium chloride crystals can be explained by the high affinity of starch to the cellulose surfaces. The fibres are easily covered by the matrix which makes the detection difficult. This was not the case looking at the fracture surface of a comparable composite with 40 wt% softwood fibre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312437000">Figure 1</xref> Mod-St-40). The softwood fibres, having dimensions 1000 times larger than those of MFC and also the fibre content was four times higher, were covered quite well by the matrix and few of them were easily observed, especially those perpendicular to the fracture surface that have been pulled out from the matrix of the opposite crack face. It is very difficult to comment on the MFC–matrix interface based on the SEM images, though the visible fibres appear to have a matrix coating. The fracture surface does not reveal any signs of pull-out or protruding broken fibrils. Thus, the fracture originates from planar brittle cracking.</p>
<p>Dimensions of fibrils seem to be in line with those values obtained by other MFC project at Innventia and others provided in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998312437000">29</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec12-0021998312437000"><title>Extraction</title>
<p>The cured samples were extracted under reflux conditions in a Soxhlet apparatus for 24 h. The weight loss of MFC-reinforced Mod-St samples after the extraction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312437000">Table 1</xref>) was compared with that of corresponding softwood fibre-reinforced Mod-St samples. The MFC-reinforced starch composites lost slightly more substance during extraction, especially the composite with only 2 wt% MFC. Some cracking occurred in the unreinforced samples during extraction and immersion in waters. The high weight losses can therefore be partly explained by loose fragments of the material that are washed away from the samples. The weight loss of the 5 wt% and 10 wt% MFC-reinforced starch samples showed similar weight losses with the samples reinforced with softwood fibres (∼15%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312437000">19</xref></sup> A plausible explanation for part of the mass loss is also the dissolution of sodium chloride remnants from the matrix preparation, as shown in e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312437000">Figure 1</xref>. Obviously, lower matrix content will result in a lower sodium chloride loss and lower total mass loss after extraction.

<p>The inherent hydrophilic property of starch-based composites is a crucial limitation for many practical applications. In this study, for the water immersion test, samples were conditioned at ambient conditions (65 ± 5% RH, 25°C) for 1 week before immersion into water. For the test at constant 43.2% RH, all samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C (133 Pa) for 24 h before the test.</p>
<p>The maximum water uptake at saturation, when immersed into water, was reduced for the MFC-reinforced Mod-St composites (2–5% water uptake) compared with that of softwood fibre-reinforced Mod-St (∼20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312437000">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The time to reach the equilibrium water uptake (10–15 h) was similar for both MFC and softwood fibre-reinforced samples. In a previous work, they observed that softwood fibre composites with AGE-modified starch (DS 1.3 and 2.3) absorbed more water with increasing fraction of fibres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312437000">19</xref></sup> The same trend was observed for the presently studied MFC-reinforced composites, though the water uptake at equilibrium was substantially reduced. Earlier studies of cellulose-reinforced TPS showed that more cellulose reinforcement resulted in less moisture absorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998312437000">30</xref></sup> The cross-linking has obviously reversed this tendency, where the matrix is now more hydrophobic than the cellulose reinforcement. From the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312437000">Figure 2</xref>, it can be found that the moisture content scales approximately linearly with the volume fractions of reinforcement (MFC or softwood fibres) and of starch, according to rule of mixtures.
<fig id="fig2-0021998312437000" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>(a) Weight and dimension ((b) thickness and (c) diameter) increase when immersed in water.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312437000-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Cured unreinforced sample of enzymatically hydrolyzed (18 h) AGE-starch had been tested to absorb only 1.5% water when saturated during water immersion (not shown). The degree of swelling in thickness direction was also evidently decreased for MFC-reinforced Mod-St composites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312437000">Figure 2(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312437000">b</xref>)). When immersed into water, MFC composites exhibited a much smaller expansion in thickness direction (3–8%) compared to corresponding matrix reinforced with 40 wt% wood fibre (23%) because of a reduced fraction of MFC and difference in reinforcement orientation distribution. The near isotropic swelling of MFC composites, where thickness and diameter expansion are approximately equal, indicates a random MFC orientation distribution in all three dimensional directions. The similar processing and pressing conditions of the much larger softwood fibres seem to a larger extent to orient the fibres in the plane of the composite plates. This manifests itself in a noticeable difference in thickness and diameter swelling for the fibre composite. The volumetric increase Δ<italic>V</italic> = Δ<italic>t</italic> Δ<italic>d</italic><sup>2</sup>, where Δ<italic>t</italic> is the thickness increase and Δ<italic>d</italic> the diameter increase, scales approximately linearly with reinforcement fraction for both the MFC and fibre composites. This indicates that there is no apparent length scale effect in swelling, going from the larger fibres to the smaller MFC.</p>

<p>The data obtained from the three-point bending tests were reduced to Young’s modulus and ultimate strength for samples conditioned at 60–70% RH, at 25°C for 4 months, and for samples saturated at 43.2% RH in a closed vessel. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312437000">Table 2</xref> and visualized with diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312437000">Figure 3</xref>. The addition of a small weight fraction of MFC, 2 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt%, did increase the strength (in-plane) of the non-filled matrix sample from 56 to 79, 90 and 102 MPa, respectively, at ambient condition and to 76, 82 and 95 MPa, respectively, at 43.2% RH. Thus, the used humidity conditions did not cause any relevant difference in the strength values. Thus, already a 2 wt% addition of MFC did afford a marked increase in the strength by 41%. At ambient conditions, the in-plane strength value of the 10 wt% MFC-reinforced composite (102 MPa) is comparable with that of 40 wt% softwood fibre-reinforced composite (97 MPa). The strength test performed in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions gave similar results, despite the difference in crack paths controlled by the fibre orientation. Unlike strength, the bending stiffness of the composites was unaffected by the increase in MFC content from 2% to 10% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312437000">Table 2</xref>). The Young’s modulus of the 10 wt% MFC-reinforced composites was reduced by a factor of 1.5 compared with the same matrix-based Mod-St-40 (40 wt% softwood fibre).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998312437000">31</xref></sup> In the case of softwood fibres, the composite stiffness increases when the reinforcement is increased from 40% to 60%. For MFC reinforcement, no such stiffness increase was observed. In fact, the stiffness is even lower for the composites with high loading of MFC compared with the unreinforced matrix. This illustrates the well-known processing problem aiming for composites with high volume fractions of cellulose nanofibrils. These nanoscale cellulose reinforcements have a much higher tendency to agglomerate compared with corresponding microscale fibres, since the effective surface area is much larger for nanoscale fibrils. A much higher processing viscosity, tendency for void formation and aggregation of reinforcement are typical problems that arise. These inevitably lead to inferior mechanical properties. This effect has also been observed for carbon nanotube composites, although the agglomeration effect is smaller since the fibre–fibre interaction is smaller for graphitic fibre surfaces (van der Waal bonding) than for cellulosic fibre surfaces (hydrogen bonding).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021998312437000">32</xref></sup> There was no significant difference in strength and stiffness values of MFC composites conditioned at ambient conditions (60–70% RH) and those saturated in a closed vessel at 43.2% RH. The strength improvements in terms of percentage reinforcement, a clearly higher potential is observed for MFC as compared with softwood fibres. In other words, with 2–10 wt% softwood fibre reinforcement, the same mechanical properties cannot be expected as for the MFC composites. This high potential of MFC-starch composites can be improved further with better MFC dispersion and optimized orientation. Together with a highly processable and cross-linked starch matrix, an interesting renewable material for structural applications presents itself, even for moist conditions.

<p>In order to increase the process ability of MFC and enzymatically degraded AGE-modified starch, a solvent exchange from water to ethanol was performed for the mixture of MFC and modified starch. The partially dried mixture of MFC and modified starch were successfully dispersed in ethanol with magnet stirring. Premixes of MFC, degraded starch with a low DS (1.3) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate were prepared and cured by BPO under hot compression moulding conditions. Pores with MFC network were found inside the composites, however, the amount of pores induced by adding MFC were negligible. There were no MFC aggregates found in the FE-SEM images of the composites. Due to the fine dimension and good mechanical properties of MFC, 2 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt% of MFC increased the ultimate strength of composites 40%, 60% and 80%, respectively, at ambient condition, while 40 wt% softwood fibre only increased the ultimate strength 70% at the same condition. The MFC-reinforced composites with less amount of cellulose fibre had better dimension stability and absorbed less amount of water during immersion test in water. The proposed route shows that it is possible to manufacture bulk MFC-reinforced cross-linked starch with attractive mechanical properties even under moist conditions.</p>
