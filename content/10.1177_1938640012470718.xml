<p><italic>Background</italic>. Chronic heel pain that is recalcitrant to nonoperative measures is a rare but disabling condition. There are no reports in the literature of extensile proximal and distal tarsal tunnel release combined with partial plantar fasciotomy in the treatment of chronic heel pain. We present our results. <italic>Methods</italic>. A retrospective chart review was conducted, and charts were assessed for details of their presenting complaints, physical exam, diagnostic studies, medical history, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for pain, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores, and complications. <italic>Results</italic>. The mean AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score was 86 ± 12.9 (range = 69-100). Of 15 heels, 10 (67%) had an excellent or good rating at the time of the last follow-up visit. One of 15 (7%) reported a poor outcome. The mean VAS pain score changed from 6.3 ± 3.1 to 1.4 ± 1.8 (P = .001). There were no wound complications or infections. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. This technique offers another operative option for chronic heel pain that is associated with satisfactory outcomes and rest pain relief. Despite reducing pain at rest in all patients, the majority of patients may be left with mild to moderate residual symptoms with activity that is similar to the outcomes of previously reported procedures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic heel pain is a relatively common symptom exhibited by patients afflicted by numerous underlying causes. These include, but are not limited to, diffuse peripheral neuropathies, compressive neuropathies of the tibial nerve and its branches, plantar fasciitis, fat pad atrophy or trauma, calcaneal stress fractures, and vascular or neoplastic etiologies. It can be difficult to determine the exact cause of the heel pain clinically, and several diagnoses may be concomitant. Of the most common etiologies, the symptoms of compression of the tibial nerve and its branches and plantar fasciitis can be similar in nature, yet difficult to distinguish diagnostically, and can present together.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012470718">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the original description of tarsal tunnel syndrome in 1960 by Kopell and Thompson,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012470718">2</xref></sup> further anatomical investigations have found that under the umbrella of diagnoses that is referred to as tarsal tunnel syndrome, there are a number of nerve entrapment syndromes. Compression of the tibial nerve proper can occur at the level of the ankle posterior to the medial malleolus. In contrast, one or more of its terminal branches—the medial plantar, lateral plantar, first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (FBLPN or Baxter’s nerve), or calcaneal sensory nerves—can be compressed more distally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012470718">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012470718"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012470718"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012470718">6</xref></sup> Prior to proceeding with operative tarsal tunnel release, failure to recognize distal compression or incompletely releasing the fibro-osseus space in which the tibial nerve courses, could result in persistent nerve dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012470718">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012470718">8</xref></sup> It has been recommended by some authors that an extensile approach to tibial nerve decompression be used to prevent this pitfall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012470718">9</xref></sup> It has, therefore, been our practice to release the nerve from the proximal edge of the flexor retinaculum past the bifurcation of the medial and lateral plantar nerves deep to the abductor hallucis, in addition to neurolyzing identifiable calcaneal nerve branches to ensure complete decompression.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that up to 88% of patients with chronic heel pain have some degree of entrapment of the FBLPN and/or the medial plantar nerve potentially from the inflamed plantar fascia based on objective electrodiagnostic findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012470718">10</xref></sup> Reports in the literature indicate that a distal tarsal tunnel release combined with a partial plantar fasciotomy may improve outcomes of pain and function in selected patients with chronic heel pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012470718">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012470718">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012470718">12</xref></sup> Perhaps surprisingly though, patient-reported satisfaction ratings were not consistently positive in all these studies. Davies et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012470718">12</xref></sup> found that complete resolution of symptoms and activity restrictions were only achieved in approximately 50% of their patients. The results of Watson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012470718">1</xref></sup> were more promising, with 71% of patients able to return to normal activities; but a quarter of their patients stated that they would not undergo the same procedure again if their unaffected limb developed similar symptoms. Outcomes of more extensile decompression of the tibial nerve and its terminal branches combined with partial plantar fasciotomy for treatment of chronic heel pain have not been reported.</p>
<p>Treatment of the most common and well-understood compressive peripheral neuropathy—carpal tunnel syndrome—also includes complete decompression of its restrictive fibro-osseus space. The most common cause of failure of surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome is incomplete proximal or distal decompression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012470718">13</xref></sup> Although there are important anatomical differences and clinical considerations regarding these 2 clinical syndromes, it is our concern that previous authors’ results in the surgical treatment of chronic heel pain may have been limited partly because of a similar pitfall. The purpose of our study was to verify the effectiveness of our extensile technique. We hypothesized that this procedure would yield outcomes that are predictably favorable with a low risk of complications in the treatment of chronic recalcitrant heel pain. A retrospective chart review evaluating Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for pain, patient- and physician-reported outcome scores, and complications is presented.</p>

<title>Material and Methods</title>
<p>After institutional review board approval, a retrospective review of the senior author’s (SGP) practice database associated with Duke University Medical Center was performed. A perioperative current procedural terminology code database identified patients with heel pain who had been treated with both partial plantar fascia release and tarsal tunnel release by the senior author (SGP) between 2009 and 2012. All patients included in our study were diagnosed with both tarsal tunnel syndrome and plantar fasciitis based on physical exam findings. All patients demonstrated pain present at both the origin of the abductor digiti quinti and the plantarmedial tubercle of the calcaneus. One third of patients (5/15) reported distal sensory changes, including numbness, paresthesias, or dysesthesias. All patients had failed greater than 9 months of multiple conservative measures and had been treated conservatively for their heel pain by at least 1 previous health care provider prior to presentation. Nonoperative treatment modalities included oral and local anti-inflammatories, heel pads, night splints, a stretching program, cryotherapy, formal physical therapy, and finally a course of strict immobilization in a controlled ankle motion (CAM) walker and short-leg walking cast for at least</p>
<p>6 weeks. No patient had undergone previous surgery for the treatment of heel pain. After a combination of the aforementioned modalities, and in all cases, at least a 6-week course of strict immobilization failed to provide relief, patients were offered surgery. All patients underwent the same operative procedure and postoperative protocol. Patients’ charts were reviewed and assessed for details of their presenting complaints, physical exam findings, pertinent diagnostic studies, medical history, VAS scores for pain, complications, and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score at the time of the most recent follow-up evaluation. VAS pain scores reported at the time of clinic evaluation were available for preoperative and postoperative comparison. However, AOFAS ankle-hindfoot scores were only available postoperatively. The practice of obtaining preoperative AOFAS ankle-hindfoot scores had not yet been implemented in our practice in the evaluation of these patients at the time of their presentation. The decision was made to forgo retrospectively obtaining these scores by asking patients to recall their preoperative status. This has been shown to be inaccurate in estimating the benefits of surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640012470718">14</xref></sup> AOFAS ankle-hindfoot scores were classified as “excellent” from 90 to 100, as “good” from 80 to 89, as “fair” from 70 to 79, and as “poor” if it was less than 70. Patients were excluded from comparison if follow-up was less than 9 months or final AOFAS ankle-hindfoot scores were not available.</p>
<sec id="section3-1938640012470718">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>In all, 14 patients (16 heels) meeting inclusion criteria were identified with initial current procedural terminology code database search. One patient was excluded because she was unreachable for follow-up. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 18 months (median = 16 months; range = 9-28 months); 7 (54%) patients were female, and 6 (46%) were male. The average patient age was 48 years (range = 29-66 years). Of 15 surgeries, 9 (60%) were performed on the right side, and 6 (40%) on the left. The average body mass index was 29.5 (range = 23.6-37.5). A total of 8 patients (62%) underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (2 patients had bilateral imaging), and 6 (46%) underwent nerve conduction studies (NCS). In 3 of the 15 heels (20%), a mass occupying lesion was documented in the proximal tarsal canal preoperatively (2 lipomatous bilateral, 1 cystic) with MRI. Of 10 patients, 6 (60%, including the 2 previously mentioned with space occupying lesions) had MRI changes consistent with some degree of plantar fasciosis (ie, thickening of the plantar fascia and/or subjacent edema). Two (33%) of 6 NCS showed electrodiagnostic evidence of a compressive neuropathy of the tibial nerve or one of its terminal branches. No patient had a preoperative diagnosis of a diffuse peripheral neuropathy or peripheral arterial disease. Three (23%) had non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.</p>

<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>All operative procedures were performed by the senior author (SGP), an orthopaedic resident or fellow, and a physician’s assistant. Patients were positioned supine. Preoperative antibiotics were administered. All patients were sedated, and the surgeon placed an ankle block consisting of 30 mL of 0.5% bupivicaine and 10 mL of 1.0% lidocaine (both without epinephrine). The distal extremity was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion. An Esmarch ankle tourniquet was applied to improve visualization. An incision was marked from a point 1 to 2 cm proximal and posterior to the most prominent portion of the medial malleolus coursing distally in a curvilinear fashion toward the distal glaborous portion of the heel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012470718">Figure 1</xref>). The incision was deepened to the level of the flexor retinaculum. Through the flexor retinaculum, the venous structures were identified. The flexor retinaculum was carefully opened distally and proximally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640012470718">Figure 2</xref>). The artery and veins were mobilized, allowing for exposure of the tibial nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640012470718">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640012470718">3B</xref>). The retinaculum was then open through its proximal extent. The nerve was carefully traced distally to free the medial and lateral plantar nerves and the calcaneal nerve branch. Once these were identified distally to the abductor fascia, the superficial and deep portions of the fascia were carefully incised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640012470718">Figure 4</xref>). Formal neurolysis was performed along the entire course of the exposed tibial nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938640012470718">Figure 5</xref>). The lateral plantar nerve was then traced distally, under the plantar foot. A neurolysis was performed of the lateral plantar nerve. When appreciated, mass lesions of the tarsal canal were removed. Next, a freer was placed over the lateral plantar nerve to protect it. A scalpel was then carefully placed along the freer, and the proximal medial plantar fascia was incised. Approximately 50% of the width of the plantar fascia was incised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1938640012470718">Figure 6</xref>). The wound was copiously irrigated. The retinaculum was not closed. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with absorbable suture and the skin with staples or sutures. A sterile dressing and bulky splint were applied. Splint and sutures or staples were removed at 14 days. A short-leg fiberglass non–weight-bearing cast was then applied and worn for 2 weeks. The patients were transitioned to a CAM walking boot at 4 weeks and permitted to progressively bear weight as tolerated. The CAM walker was weaned at 6 weeks.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean AOFAS hindfoot-ankle score at the time of final follow-up was 86 ± 12.9 (range = 69-100). Of 15 heels, 10 (67%) had an excellent or good rating at the time of the last follow-up visit. Of 15 heels, 4 (28%) had fair outcomes. Only 1 (7%) of 15 reported a poor outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1938640012470718">Figure 7</xref>). The proportion of patients’ outcomes as they relate to pain, activity limitations, and maximum walking distance within the AOFAS hindfoot-ankle scores are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1938640012470718">Figures 8</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1938640012470718">10</xref>, respectively. The mean preoperative VAS pain score was 6.3 ± 3.1. The mean postoperative VAS pain score was 1.4 ± 1.8. The difference in preoperative and postoperative VAS pain scores was found to be statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .001). No statistical correlations were found between patient-related variables or preoperative diagnostic findings and final outcomes. There were 2 cases of transient sensory changes, which included plantar heel numbness and distal lateral plantar nerve numbness affecting the small toe, both of which resolved over the course of the first postoperative year and were presumed to be a neurapraxia. There were no wound complications or infections. There were no cases of postoperative symptomatic thromboembolic disease. The 2 patients who demonstrated electrodiagnostic values consistent with compression of the tibial nerve preoperatively had either a good or excellent AOFAS hind-foot score result, with a VAS pain score of 1 or 0. One patient was found to have bilateral entrapment of her tibial nerve in the proximal tarsal tunnel as evidenced by lipomatous masses on MRI. These masses, which measured 3.0 × 2.5 cm<sup>2</sup> and 4.0 × 4.0 cm<sup>2</sup> on the right and left, respectively, were both pathologically confirmed to be benign lipomas. This patient’s postoperative AOFAS hind-foot score was excellent bilaterally, and she reported VAS pain scores that dropped to 0. Despite the failure of intraoperative exploration to reveal a mass lesion in the 1 patient who had a perineural cyst identified on preoperative MRI, his outcome was good. Of 5 patients with preoperative MRI evidence of plantar fasciosis, 3 had excellent postoperative AOFAS ankle-hindfoot scores. The 1 patient who demonstrated a poor postoperative AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score did demonstrate preoperative evidence of plantar fasciosis on MRI. His pain was primarily activity related and associated with coincident Achilles tendonosis that was present prior to surgery. His VAS pain score at rest on final follow-up had decreased to 3 from a preoperative level of 10. Plantar heel pain and dysesthesias, which were his primary preoperative complaints, had resolved.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is estimated that 10% of the general population experiences plantar heel pain throughout their lifetime.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640012470718">15</xref></sup> Plantar heel pain is most often attributed to plantar fasciitis. Fortunately, more than 90% of patients with plantar fasciitis respond favorably to nonoperative measures such as stretching programs, orthoses, cryotherapy, anti-inflammatories, and weight loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640012470718">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640012470718"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640012470718"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938640012470718">19</xref></sup> However, the management of chronic recalcitrant heel pain remains a major orthopaedic challenge as a result of both diagnostic and treatment considerations.</p>
<p>Obtaining a thorough but directed history and physical exam remains the basis of narrowing the differential diagnosis of the underlying cause of chronic heel pain. The signs and symptoms classically associated with plantar fasciitis include insidious onset and progressively worsening plantar heel pain, start-up pain, and pain localized to the origin of the plantar fascia about the medial tubercle of the calcaneus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938640012470718">20</xref></sup> Nerve entrapment syndromes of the foot and ankle that are often broadly referred to as tarsal tunnel syndrome can also present with pain localized to the origin of the plantar fascia or the origin of the abductor digiti quinti in addition to symptoms referred to the distal distribution of the nerve involved. Baxter and Pfeffer were the first to describe the entrapment syndrome associated with compression of the FBLPN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012470718">3</xref></sup> They felt that neuropathic pain associated with compression of this nerve could be clinically differentiated from isolated plantar fasciitis based on pain localized to the origin of the abductor digiti quinti and the plantar fascia, respectively. Several authors have subsequently highlighted the difficulty in differentiating the 2 clinically and have reported satisfactory outcomes with addressing both pathological entities at the same time with some combination of fasciotomy or fasciectomy and neurolysis of the FBLPN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012470718">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012470718">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012470718">12</xref></sup> This diagnostic difficulty has also been our experience. All patients included in our study endorsed heel pain present at both the origin of the abductor digiti quinti and the plantarmedial tubercle of the calcaneus.</p>
<p>Both open and endoscopic procedures have been described to address chronic heel pain. There are unique risk and benefit profiles of these techniques described to address both the plantar fascia and tarsal tunnel as a source of the chronic heel pain. Endoscopic procedures offer the theoretical advantage of shorter recovery times and decreased wound morbidity over open procedures. El Shazly and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938640012470718">21</xref></sup> have recently demonstrated that proximal tarsal tunnel decompression can be achieved endoscopically, yielding good to excellent results in 85.7% (6/7) of patients. These outcomes are consistent with previous results reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938640012470718">22</xref></sup> However, their complications are not reported. Although these results are promising, they should be evaluated with caution when considering endoscopic treatment of proximal tarsal tunnel syndrome. The risk of complications is not addressed in their analysis, and their sample size is limited. Furthermore, there are no reports of simultaneous decompression of the proximal tarsal tunnel and the plantar fascia in the same setting using endoscopic techniques in patients with pain reported at both the origin of the digiti quinti and the plantarmedial tubercle of the calcaneus.</p>
<p>There is no clear consensus of whether either an open or an endoscopic technique leads to superior outcomes in studies that have examined the results of isolated plantar fascia release. There are complications unique to the endoscopic procedure. Complications such as nerve entrapment, lateral column pain, arterial laceration, stress fracture, and nerve injury have been reported with variable frequencies, ranging from approximately 0% to 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938640012470718">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938640012470718"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938640012470718"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938640012470718"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938640012470718">27</xref></sup> Of these, lateral column pain is not unique to the endoscopic procedure. The relative width of the plantar fascia released has been shown to be the most important factor in predicting postoperative lateral column pain with either technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938640012470718">28</xref></sup> We feel that direct visualization of the entire proximal plantar fascia allows the surgeon to more accurately estimate this critical width. However, the accuracy of this estimate based on the technique used has not been evaluated in the literature and offers an avenue for future research.</p>
<p>Open surgery also offers the advantage of complete visualization of the surrounding anatomy. Extensile exposure of the plantar fascia offers the advantage of direct visualization of the plantar fascia and the adjacent FBLPN. One would speculate that open procedures would be less likely to be associated with iatrogenic nerve injury secondary to better exposure. This has not been borne out in the literature in the sparse data available directly comparing the 2 techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938640012470718">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1938640012470718">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1938640012470718">30</xref></sup> In our series, we only had 2 cases in which postoperative numbness was noted. Both the plantar heel numbness and distal lateral plantar nerve numbness affecting the small toe were considered to be neurapraxias that resolved within a year.</p>
<p>We experienced no cases of wound infections or dehiscence with our extensile approach, which demonstrates that soft-tissue morbidity is not necessarily associated with a more extensile exposure. Watson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012470718">1</xref></sup> and Conflitti and Tarquinio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012470718">11</xref></sup> both reported low rates of wound dehiscence and infection (1/80 and 1/23, respectively) with similar but smaller operative exposures. Our results with regard to wound healing are comparable with theirs, and we attribute this at least in part to our more conservative postoperative weight-bearing restrictions. Our patients remained strictly non–weight bearing for 4 postoperative weeks as opposed to the progression of weight bearing after the first postoperative visit that is presented in their series. Even with endoscopic procedures, protected weight bearing with cast immobilization may to lead to a faster return to activities and higher satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1938640012470718">31</xref></sup> Moreover, despite faster recovery times with minimally invasive techniques, an open approach used to address chronic heel pain resulted in higher patient satisfaction and reductions in postoperative pain in a direct comparison presented by Brekke and Green.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1938640012470718">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Endoscopic release of the plantar fascia and proximal tarsal tunnel does not allow for the identification and neurolysis of the medial plantar, lateral plantar, FBLPN (Baxter’s), or calcaneal sensory nerves. Because the underlying etiology of the majority of chronic calcaneal pain is unknown, we feel that the extensile exposure we have described allows the surgeon to address many of the potential sources of patients’ pain in one setting. For example, 3 heels were identified on preoperative MRI to have compression of the tibial nerve in the proximal tarsal canal in addition to their symptoms of plantar fasciitis. The nerve was completely exposed, and lipomatous masses were identified in 2 out of 3 of these patients. The 1 mass not found appeared cystic in nature on MRI and may have been a ganglion that spontaneously resolved. Nonetheless, all 3 of these patients went on to good or excellent outcomes at least in part because of exploration and release of the nerve proximally.</p>
<p>MRI has been shown to identify a mass lesion in only a small proportion of patients with heel pain. When evaluating patients with heel pain, unless atypical signs and symptoms are present, such as bilateral involvement, nocturnal pain, acute onset, and neuropathic features, MRI rarely changes the management strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1938640012470718">32</xref></sup> Watson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012470718">1</xref></sup> have also shown that no correlations could be drawn between MRI findings consistent with plantar fasciosis and a patient’s outcome after undergoing partial plantar fascia and distal tarsal tunnel releases. They did not report any mass lesions in their series. We agree with their recommendation that MRI is only indicated when atypical symptoms are present. Other objective diagnostic options include ultrasonography, NCS, and electromyography (EMG). Their utility is debatable, and current evidence-based recommendations are evolving.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1938640012470718">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1938640012470718">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>An evidence-based systematic review has demonstrated that there is a dearth of high-level clinical evidence available to support the use of electrodiagnostics to evaluate entrapment neuropathy of the tibial nerve and its branches in the foot and ankle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1938640012470718">33</xref></sup> As shown by Rosson and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938640012470718">35</xref></sup> the amount of compression of the medial and lateral plantar nerves may also be a dynamic phenomenon based on position of the foot, which could affect the utility of static tests such as NCS and EMG. The sensitivity of electrodiagnostic studies also varies considerably throughout the literature, with reported rates being between 60% and 96%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1938640012470718">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1938640012470718">37</xref></sup> There is also no available literature that demonstrates that electrodiagnostic studies are helpful in assessing a patient’s prognosis and/or expected response to surgical treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1938640012470718">33</xref></sup> In contrast, Gondring et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1938640012470718">38</xref></sup> demonstrated that conduction values may be discordant in some clinical scenarios. Approximately 50% of the patients in their series reported subjective improvement of their heel pain symptoms following proximal tarsal tunnel release. Of those patients who were subjectively unimproved, 88% demonstrated a significant objective improvement in their postoperative motor nerve latencies. No significant association between preoperative electrodiagnostic studies and outcome could be made with the numbers available in our series. The heterogeneity of the objective analyses such as MRI and NCS available for comparison in our study is a result of the referral patterns to our tertiary practice. All the patients treated in this series had failed conservative treatment for their heel pain by at least 1 previous provider. When available, the MRI and/or NCS/EMG was often ordered by a previous provider. These studies are not routinely ordered in our practice in the evaluation of chronic heel pain unless dictated by an unusual historical or exam finding. They are costly, nonspecific, have not been shown to be prognostic of surgical outcomes, and generally do not change our standard treatment algorithm. However, these observations are limited by our study’s small sample size and should be considered with caution.</p>
<p>We have found that the extensile technique that we have described is excellent at reducing patients’ symptoms of pain at relative rest, as indicated by their average VAS pain scores reported at clinic presentation that dropped from an average of 6.3 to 1.4, which is statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .001). This is consistent with the postoperative values reported in the literature using similar techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012470718">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012470718">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012470718">12</xref></sup> The majority of patients (10/15, 67%) continued to have either mild to moderate pain on an occasional or daily basis. Also, 53% (8/15) reported continued limitations with recreational activities. This still translated to a majority (67%) of patients achieving good and excellent outcomes as measured by the AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score. As Davies and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012470718">12</xref></sup> have pointed out, the results of treating chronic heel pain with partial plantar fasciotomy and neurolysis of the distal tarsal tunnel are predictable and rewarding when the duration and severity of previous symptoms are considered. However, in their study population, fewer than 50% of patients reported total satisfaction with the procedure. Our study was limited, in that we did not include a subjective patient-reported outcome of overall satisfaction with the procedure. We also agree that many of the elements of the AOFAS ankle-hindfoot outcome score are not necessarily relevant to patients with chronic heel pain. This may be a contributing factor to why there seems to be some discrepancy between VAS pain scores and the patient reported AOFAS ankle-hindfoot outcome score subcategories.</p>
<p>Like the available literature pertaining to the treatment of chronic heel pain, our investigation is limited by the biases inherent to a retrospective review. The strength of our analysis is limited by our small sample size and inability to compare patients’ AOFAS outcome scores with preoperative values. However, our small sample size exemplifies how rare surgical intervention is indicated in the treatment of chronic heel pain, especially noting the demographics of the patients treated in our practice—an academic-associated referral practice. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with similar series published in the literature. Although long-term follow-up is limited, we believe that our average follow-up of 18 months is adequate to evaluate the overall outcome of this procedure. Our low complication rate provides evidence that open procedures are not necessarily associated with a higher rate of wound healing problems. Further research is necessary to determine the necessity for proximal tarsal tunnel release in all cases of chronic heel pain. Extensile decompression of both the proximal and distal tarsal tunnel combined with partial plantar fasciotomy may only be indicated when advanced imaging indicates the presence of a proximal mass lesion and there is a high index of suspicion for concomitant plantar fasciitis. Unfortunately, it is still not clear when advanced imaging such as MRI or ultrasound is indicated in this patient population.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Chronic recalcitrant heel pain remains a diagnostic and treatment conundrum. Fortunately, only a small percentage of patients fail to respond to nonoperative measures. When this occurs, numerous operative options are available, with reports of acceptable success rates. Extensile decompression of the tibial nerve and its branches combined with partial plantar fascia release offers another operative option that is associated with satisfactory outcomes. It also provides the surgeon the opportunity to address several causes of plantar heel pain, which is not possible with less-invasive exposures. This may be especially important when a proximal mass lesion is suspected. The more extensive soft-tissue dissection described does not seem to be associated with a higher rate of wound healing problems but is still associated with outcomes similar to a limited distal tarsal tunnel release. Despite reducing pain at relative rest in all patients, the majority of patients may be left with mild to moderate residual symptoms with activity. Therefore, patients should be cautioned of these limitations, and realistic expectations should be discussed preoperatively.</p>
