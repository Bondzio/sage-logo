<abstract>
<p>Injection pressure and hydraulic nozzle flow rate are significant parameters that influence mixture formation and combustion in the direct injection (DI) diesel combustion process. An injection pressure increase enhances mixture formation as well as combustion. Decreasing the hydraulic flow rate, by means of reducing spray hole orifice diameter, affects mixture formation primarily through improved gas entrainment processes. Both injection pressure increase and hydraulic flow rate decrease therefore benefit mixture formation and combustion, which cause less soot emissions. Thus, the application of higher exhaust gas recirculation rates to decrease nitrogen oxide emissions is possible. The objective of this paper is to determine the effects of hydraulic flow rate variation in combination with very high injection pressures.</p>
<p>Engine tests are carried out using a single-cylinder research engine, which is based on a light-duty DI diesel engine. With a displacement of 755 cm<sup>3</sup> per cylinder, the engines range between typical passenger car (≈ 500 cm<sup>3</sup>) and medium-sized heavy-duty (≈ 1000 cm<sup>3</sup>) engines. The engine is equipped with a prototype common rail fuel injection system that is capable of delivering system pressures larger than 250 MPa. Four different hydraulic nozzle layouts are tested. The effects are presented for one part load and one full load operating condition. For each engine operating point, exhaust gas recirculation variations with different injection pressure levels and boost conditions are conducted. Evaluation of engine test results is performed at a constant soot/nitrogen oxide emission ratio of 1:10, which is relevant in engine calibration. Hydraulic measurements and the application of an empirical spray model support the interpretation of the engine test results.</p>
<p>It is observed that a reduced hydraulic flow rate is beneficial for part load emission performance. It was found that a lower hydraulic flow rate causes a higher mean relative air/fuel ratio within the fuel spray and thus induces less soot formation. Moreover, the premixed fraction of combustion is enhanced through both injection pressure and hydraulic flow rate increases. In full load operation, the beneficial effect of reduced flow rates by means of smaller nozzle orifices cannot be detected. Parameters such as injection duration, combustion duration and spray momentum during spray/wall interaction are identified as more important. Boost pressure variation has only a minor effect on part load, whereas full load results are greatly influenced. In part load and full load operation, a limitation of the potential to reduce emissions is not observed within the investigated injection pressure range.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The consistently tightened global emission regulations, as well as the request for ever more economical combustion engines in the course of rising fuel prices and the discussion on climate change, lead to the necessity of an economically reasonable combination of state-of-the-art combustion and exhaust gas treatment technology. Therefore, diesel combustion research is still essential today for the development of clean and energy-efficient combustion engines.</p>
<p>In numerous publications, injection pressure is proved to have a remarkable effect on the diesel combustion process. An increased injection pressure enhances mixture formation as well as combustion. The essential reasons identified that advance the mixture formation process are a faster spray penetration into the combustion chamber as well as a higher gas entrainment rate into the spray. In particular, spray tip velocity has a significant influence on spray dispersion as well as gas entrainment, and therefore influences the formation of a lean fuel spray. Siebers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087411430304">1</xref></sup> showed that gas entrainment is the most important parameter for the quality of mixing-controlled combustion because of its significance on vaporization of fuel. Bruneaux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087411430304">2</xref></sup> observed that increasing injection pressure improved gas entrainment and air/fuel mixing velocities. Local mixing rates remained constant when increasing injection pressure. An advanced global gas entrainment that shortens the time for mixture formation at constant fuel mass is supposed to be the beneficial effect. Many researchers have postulated no limitation of increasing injection pressures on the potential to enhance mixture formation and thus a further emission reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087411430304">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087411430304">4</xref></sup> In contrast, Fischer and Stein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087411430304">5</xref></sup> presented a limitation of the potential to increase emission performance through rising injection pressures. There exists a maximum feasible emission reduction for a certain injection pressure level (critical injection pressure). Beyond this critical injection pressure, a further reduction of emissions is not achievable. The magnitude of critical injection pressure level depends on boost and engine load conditions. Wakisaka et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087411430304">6</xref></sup> proposed that a simultaneous reduction of soot and nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions was only possible through increasing injection pressure, boost pressure and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate at the same time.</p>
<p>Nozzle orifice diameter is another parameter that affects mixture formation and therewith gas entrainment processes. Bruneaux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087411430304">2</xref></sup> stated that nozzle hole diameter had a significant effect on the global mixing rate. A reduction of nozzle hole diameter primarily improves local mixing rate (gas entrainment is improved), while an increase of nozzle hole diameter enhances global mixing rate through a higher spray momentum, which can compensate the lower local mixing rate. The results of Dodge et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087411430304">7</xref></sup> showed that soot formation was greatly affected by orifice diameter and injection pressure. In agreement with Bruneaux, reduced soot formation was due to a faster mixing rate of fuel and air in the fuel jet. Lamping et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087411430304">8</xref></sup> demonstrated the effects of hydraulic nozzle flow rate (HFR) through variation of spray hole diameter on combustion in passenger car (PC) diesel engines. A reduction of HFR has a beneficial effect on soot and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in part load operation. Full load operation results identify, for increased flow rates, that at a certain injection rate, a limit of advancement in mixture formation is reached. A rise of HFR and therefore increased spray momentum is not transformed into a faster combustion. Another investigation by Pickett and Siebers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087411430304">9</xref></sup> also observed that gas entrainment is strongly influenced by nozzle orifice diameter. In particular, soot formation is reduced greatly using micro-orifices. The formation of soot is decreased and might eventually be inhibited when cross-sectional average relative air/fuel ratio (λ<sub>V</sub>) in the fuel jet at stabilized diffusion flame position rises to a value larger than 0.5.</p>
<p>The objective of this publication is to identify the effects of HFR variation in combination with high injection pressures on mixture formation, combustion and emissions through hydraulic measurements and primarily engine test results. Moreover, a spray penetration model developed by Siebers et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411430304">10</xref></sup> is used to describe differences in mixture formation due to variation of HFR.</p>

<title>Background HFR design</title>
<p>The layout of the HFR for a specific combustion process significantly influences emission performance as well as maximum power output of an engine. For PC engines, the design process is always a compromise between meeting a required emission regulation and desired engine power demand. A reduction of HFR is beneficial for emission performance in part load operation. However, at full load, the injection duration would increase significantly so that engine power output would decrease for a defined power demand. For heavy-duty (HD) HFR layouts, the situation is slightly different from that of PC layout criteria. In contrast to PC legislation, the relevant area for emission certification comprises full load operation (accounts for approximately 50% of the overall test result). However, the spread of engine speed is lower compared to PC engines. Therefore, injection duration at full load operation is less limited compared to PC engines. Hence, smaller HFR layouts are generally adopted when power requirements are fulfilled because emission performance significantly improves.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411430304">Figure 1</xref> shows a comparison of different specific hydraulic nozzle designs (HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub>) of PC and HD combustion processes. Included is also the layout of the base nozzle design of the research engine. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411430304">Figure 1(a)</xref> depicts the HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> versus cylinder displacement V<sub>Cyl</sub>, whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411430304">Figure 1(b)</xref> plots specific power P<sub>spec</sub> versus HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub>. The nozzle data depicted in the diagrams are originated from current PC and HD engine projects at the Bosch diesel engine test facility in Stuttgart. Obviously, one can see that nozzle layouts for PC and HD applications differ. In general, PC designs show a higher HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> ratio compared to HD applications. The reasons for these differences were already explained above.</p>

<sec id="section4-1468087411430304">
<title>Definition of the hydraulic nozzle designs</title>
<p>For this investigation, four nozzle designs have been selected. All deployed nozzles are of the sac hole type design and feature conical converging spray holes with hydroerosive rounded and therefore flow-optimized inlet edges. Since the aim of the investigation is to identify the effects caused by variation of the HFR, all nozzle geometry parameters have been kept constant, except the outlet diameter of the spray holes. The desired nozzle flow rate was achieved by adjusting the spray hole outlet diameter. The ratio HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> of 1.19 1/min of the base nozzle design correlates with typical values of engines in this displacement class. Based on this nozzle layout, three further designs were defined. The first nozzle was configured with an increased HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> value of 1.59 1/min, which corresponds with typical PC nozzle layouts. In the next step, the ratio HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> was reduced to 0.79 1/min, which relates to conventional HD nozzle layouts. Additionally, a third variant with a reduced ratio HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> of 1.06 1/min was designed to have an intermediate step between the HD and base nozzle layout. The low HFR design of the HD nozzle made this extra design necessary as, in the beginning of the investigation, it was not verified if this layout would show a satisfying performance in full load operation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468087411430304">Table 1</xref> lists the specifications of the investigated nozzle designs. The HFR for each nozzle was determined on a test rig using testing oil according to the International Standards Organization (ISO) standard ISO4113. Therefore, the nozzles were streamed for 60 s with the testing fluid at a temperature of 40° C and a pressure of 10 MPa.</p>

<title>Hydraulic measurements</title>
<p>How diesel fuel is injected into the combustion chamber locally and timely is essential for the evaluation of fuel injection systems. The requirements for fuel injection derive from the diesel combustion process and the well-known development drivers: fuel consumption, emissions, comfort and power output. Macroscopically, the fuel injection process is defined by injection mass, start of injection (SoI), injection pressure and injection rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087411430304">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Within this section, the two deployed hydraulic measurement techniques are explained briefly. All measurements are performed with testing oil certified by ISO4113.</p>
<sec id="section6-1468087411430304">
<title>Spray force</title>
<p>The analysis of the spray force data delivers detailed information about injection efficiency, spray symmetry, spray breakup and spray structure. Therefore, a piezoelectric pressure sensor screens the injected fuel spray at different distances from the nozzle. Thus, the spray structure and the pressure raw signal, which is later transformed into a force value, are detected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087411430304">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1468087411430304">
<title>Injection rate</title>
<p>Generally, the injection rate at the nozzle outlet is obtained through time differentiation of injection mass during one injection cycle. Several measurement techniques exist to obtain the desired information. Within this investigation, a new method developed by Bosch, which is based on the hydraulic pressure rise detection, came into use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087411430304">12</xref></sup> The system is capable of measuring injection mass and injection rate at the same time. The method is called the hydraulic pressure rise analysis (HDA) and is patent registered by Bosch. The fuel is injected into a measurement chamber filled with pressurized liquid testing oil. The measuring volume is kept constant. The injection event induces a pressure rise within the chamber. Injection mass and injection rate can then be calculated from pressure rise modification over time. A high accuracy of the method is achieved through correction of the attained data with the help of the calculated sound velocity for each injection cycle. The correction is necessary because of pressure waves in the chamber caused by the injection event and the dependency of the measuring results from the compressibility of the testing oil. A piezoelectric pressure sensor is used to detect the pressure in the vessel.</p>

<title>Single-cylinder engine</title>
<p>Experiments were conducted on a single-cylinder light-duty diesel engine with direct fuel injection. The research engine was converted from a four-cylinder series production type engine. With a displacement of 755 cm<sup>3</sup> per cylinder the engine ranges between typical PC (≈ 500 cm<sup>3</sup>) and medium-sized HD (≈ 1000 cm<sup>3</sup>) engines. Temperatures of the oil and engine coolant were conditioned externally to 80° C. An external boost conditioning system supplied the engine with dry combustion air. The temperature upstream of the EGR feed was controlled to constantly 35° C for this measurement campaign. The research engine is equipped with a solenoid valve controlled prototype common rail fuel injection system. This system is capable of generating pressures larger than 250 MPa. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468087411430304">Table 2</xref> summarizes the most relevant specifications of the research engine.</p>

<title>Operating conditions and fuel</title>
<p>To determine the effects of HFR in combination with high injection pressures, two operating conditions were defined. The engine experiments were conducted on a typical part load and full load operating point. For each operating point, a boost pressure variation was performed to investigate the influence and potential of the cylinder charge density. The values of the base boost pressures for part and full load operation are higher than the ones found in series applications. These progressive boost pressure definitions take into account that high fuel injection pressures need increased boost pressure levels to unfold their potential to reduce emissions. The values of the low boost conditions are within the range of current series applications. To evaluate the effects of increased boost pressure levels, the high boost conditions were defined. These values are of academic nature, especially for part load operation, and not achievable in real engine operation (current light-duty engines with a one-stage variable nozzle turbine (VNT) turbocharger system).</p>
<p>In part load, a constant start of energizing was applied, so that the SoI for all parameter variations could be assumed as approximately constant (maximum deviation ± 0.3 crank angle degrees (°CA)). The full load experiments were carried out at a constant 50% rate of heat release (RoHR), due to the large spread in the injection rate profiles of the nozzles. Thus, a violation of the maximum allowed cylinder pressure could be avoided. The experimental conditions for both operating points are depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468087411430304">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>To reduce the effects resulting from number, quantity and timing of injections per working cycle, a single shot injection strategy was applied. Thus, the impacts of pre and post injections on mixture formation and combustion could be avoided. For that reason, the consideration of combustion noise emissions is not the object of this paper. The combustion noise level in part load operation varies between 85 dB(A) and 100 dB(A), depending on injection pressure level, boost pressure level and HFR of the injection nozzle. The combustion noise level is obtained through a calculation procedure that respects the cylinder pressure as its main input. An increase of either injection pressure level or HFR induce rising combustion noise levels. Lower combustion noise levels are reached by applying higher boost pressures. In full load operation, overall combustion noise levels are lower because of a shorter ignition delay (higher boost pressure levels) and a retarded start of combustion compared to part load operation.</p>

<title>Engine test method and data presentation</title>
<p>According to the experimental conditions listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468087411430304">Table 3</xref>, for both load conditions, variations of EGR rate with different injection pressures (modulation through adjustment of rail pressure) were carried out. The most effective way to reduce NO<sub>x</sub> emissions during combustion is the EGR. When adopting EGR, exhaust gases are fed from the exhaust manifold back into the intake system. The recirculated exhaust gas with low oxygen concentration replaces a fraction of fresh intake air. Therefore, the oxygen partial pressure of the cylinder charge is decreased. Compared to engine operation without EGR, a larger mass of cylinder charge must be transported through the flame front in order to supply the combustion with a constant mass of oxygen. Therefore, the thermal energy of the flame is transferred to a larger mass behind the flame front, resulting in lower peak combustion temperatures. Although by increasing EGR levels, the global process temperatures are rising. Furthermore, the exhaust gas possesses a lower specific heat capacity compared to air. This also contributes to a reduction of flame and mean cylinder gas temperature, but the share is substantially lower. Formation of thermal NO<sub>x</sub> emissions is thereby significantly reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087411430304">13</xref></sup> However, an increasing EGR rate (decreasing oxygen concentration) causes the growth of local fuel rich zones in quantity and size, so that soot formation is enhanced. Moreover, combustion is retarded, and a greater part is shifted into the expansion phase at lower cylinder pressures and temperatures. Unfavourable combustion chamber conditions, such as deteriorating soot oxidation processes, hence increase overall soot emission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087411430304">14</xref></sup></p>

<p>Each EGR variation starts with a measuring point without EGR. Thereafter, the EGR rate is successively increased. With rising injection pressure, the NO<sub>x</sub> emissions increase at the start of the EGR variation. Through enhancement of the EGR rate, NO<sub>x</sub> emissions then drop strongly. In contrast, soot emissions start to rise when applying a sufficiently high EGR rate. The higher the injection pressure is, the later and the steeper occurs the slope respectively the lower are the soot emissions for a fixed λ<sub>V</sub>. An injection pressure increase leads therefore to an improvement of EGR tolerance. Thus, the EGR rate can be advanced more intensely when enhancing injection pressure without a rise in soot emissions. Hence, the disadvantageous higher NO<sub>x</sub> emissions at the beginning of the EGR variation can be overcompensated. The relationship between rising soot and decreasing NO<sub>x</sub> emissions when enhancing EGR rate can be illustrated clearly by combining both parameters in one diagram. The injection pressure variation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087411430304">Figure 3</xref> leads to the familiar soot/NO<sub>x</sub> relation (soot/NO<sub>x</sub> trade-off) presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087411430304">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>With increasing injection pressure, the plots are shifted to lower emission values. Therefore, the emission advantage declines with each step of injection pressure accentuation. All curves cross the 1:10 application line. This line represents a constant ratio of 1:10 for soot and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in g/kg of fuel. The European Union (EU) emission legislation as far as EU4 level has always been defined accordingly to this ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087411430304">15</xref></sup> With definition of the present valid emission level EU5, this ratio was lowered considerably and thus intensified, so that equipment with a diesel particulate filter to achieve the required emission level was virtually enforced (particulate number was also restricted). However, a soot/NO<sub>x</sub> ratio within the range of 1:10 is still a good reference value for both operating conditions and so the diesel particulate filter loading will be kept within limits. All data presented within this paper are based on a soot/NO<sub>x</sub> ratio of 1:10. For each injection pressure variation, the 1:10 value of an EGR trade-off was calculated through linear interpolation and combined into one curve. Therefore, it is possible to display the correlations in a much more compact style.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>In this section, the influences of varying the HFR through adjustment of spray hole outlet diameter in combination with high-pressure fuel injection are presented. The section starts with the depiction of the effects resulting from different hydraulic nozzle configurations. The engine test results will be discussed on the basis of the measuring points at a defined soot/NO<sub>x</sub> emissions ratio of 1:10. The procedure to determine these values was described in the previous section.</p>

<title>Hydraulic characterization of the investigated nozzles</title>
<p>The combustion process and the internal engine emission formation are significantly influenced by injection rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087411430304">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087411430304">14</xref></sup> Due to the large spread in the HFR between the nozzles, the profiles diverge; therefore, this will affect combustion and emission formation seriously. The measurements of injection rate and spray force within the scope of this investigation thus provide a major contribution to analyse the differently proceeding mixture formation processes.</p>

<title>Injection rate</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087411430304">Figure 5</xref> shows the four injection rate profiles for two different injection pressure levels at constant fuel mass. For a better comparability, the SoI for all profiles was set to a common point of time. For all nozzles, an injection pressure increase leads to a clearly more rapid rise of the injection rate during needle opening. This characteristic rise of the needle speed when lifting the pressure level is typical for common rail systems with hydraulically controlled needle movement. In particular, the maximum spray velocity at the beginning of the injection event is strongly influenced. A higher maximum spray penetration length could be the result and thus leads to a shift of ignition locations in regions more distant from the nozzle. The pressure rise causes an increase of maximum injection rate, so that the necessary injection duration for a constant fuel mass is shortened. This again induces a shorter and therefore more efficient combustion.</p>

<p>For the base nozzle with HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> of 1.19, results from an HFR increase (respectively, decrease) of about 33% and an increase (respectively, decrease) of injection rate also by 33%. This relationship yields a faster penetration of the spray tip when increasing HFR and a slower penetration when reducing HFR. Furthermore, the variation of HFR results, analogue to the injection pressure variation, in a shortened (respectively, prolonged) required injection duration when considering a constant fuel mass.</p>

<title>Spray force</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087411430304">Figure 6</xref> illustrates the effects caused by variation of injection pressure level as well as HFR on measured spray force data at a distance of 6 mm from the spray hole outlet. Both an increase of injection pressure level and a rise of HFR result in a growth of maximum spray force. A greater maximum spray force induces an overall higher spray momentum. Long injection durations, as can be found under full load conditions, lead to an intensive interaction between fuel spray and combustion chamber walls. A higher spray momentum at this point of time delivers additional energy to enhance mixture formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087411430304">16</xref></sup> Only three nozzle variants were measured, the nozzle with HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> of 1.06 was left out.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087411430304">Figure 7</xref> displays the soot/NO<sub>x</sub> emissions when varying HFR plotted versus the considered injection pressure range. The emission behaviour improves with reduced HFR (smaller spray hole outlet diameter) within the complete pressure range. Generally, the soot/NO<sub>x</sub> emissions decrease with rising injection pressure. For none of the nozzle configurations is an evident saturation in emission improvement within the injection pressure range recognizable. However, the gradient of emission improvement rises with increasing HFR, i.e. the positive effect of injection pressure on EGR tolerance of the combustion process is larger for nozzle configurations with higher HFR and therefore more unfavourable mixture formation characteristics. Thus, the emission results converge with increasing injection pressure.</p>

<p>In addition to the effects regarding the emission formation, injection pressure and HFR affect the combustion process. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087411430304">Figure 9</xref> shows the shift of the 50% heat release (α-50%) depending on the injection pressure level and HFR. Both increase of injection pressure and HFR shift the α-50% closer to the top dead centre (TDC) position. The reason for this is a larger rate of injection when increasing either one of the parameters. A closer α-50% timing to TDC results in a thermodynamically favourable position for an efficient combustion, and hence a lower fuel consumption. The α-50% is shifted about 34% towards TDC independently of nozzle design when increasing injection pressure from lowest to highest level. At high injection pressures, the α-50% positions are within the range of values that enable optimal specific fuel consumption, as is illustrated in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087411430304">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>Further information about the combustion process is attainable through the estimation of premixed and mixing-controlled fractions of combustion. Premixed combustion is identified by conversion of the fuel mass, which is injected during the ignition delay period. The preparation quality of the fuel is controlled by the speed of physical and chemical processes. During the mixing-controlled phase, the chemical reactions proceed very fast because the combustion is already in progress. The burning rate is therefore limited by the mixing processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087411430304">14</xref></sup> In this paper, the fraction of premixed combustion (Prem_Ratio) was estimated through the following relation</p>

The premixed fraction grows larger with increasing injection pressure and HFR due to the greater injection rate and therewith injected fuel mass. So a larger fuel mass is mixed with air and ready for combustion during the ignition delay period. An increase of HFR affects the premixed fraction clearly more than an enhancement of injection pressure. The premixed fraction dominates the combustion of the nozzle with the largest HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> ratio (PC-like nozzle). It is continuously greater than 50% within the investigated injection pressure range. All nozzles with a lower HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> ratio show a notably smaller premixed fraction. Therefore, the process of combustion for these nozzle configurations is predominantly mixing controlled.</p>

<p>Considering the base nozzle design (HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> of 1.19), an increase (respectively, decrease) of HFR by 33% affects the necessary DoI by about ± 25%. The results of different DoIs are again shortened (respectively, prolonged) burning rates. However, these proportionately change clearly lesser than the DoIs. Based on this fact, one could reason that for an increase of injection rate through enlargement of spray hole profiles, the combustion velocity limits the conversion of shorter DoIs into shorter durations of combustion. Furthermore, the diagram reveals an intense growing maximum RoHR when increasing the HFR. This points out the larger premixed part of combustion.</p>

<title>Effect of boost pressure variation</title>
<p>The boost pressure, which determines the density of the cylinder charge, is another parameter that has a major effect on mixture formation, combustion and emission formation. Therefore, in this study, additionally to the base condition, a higher and a lower boost condition was investigated. The potential of boost pressure has been analysed in many publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087411430304">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468087411430304">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087411430304"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468087411430304">21</xref></sup> It can be verified that a boost pressure increase in combination with high injection pressures and high EGR rates could reduce soot and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087411430304">6</xref></sup></p>

As shown in the diagrams, boost pressure has only a minor effect in part load on the emission performance. The increment from lowest to base boost condition indicates only, if at all a slight improvement in soot and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. The highest boost condition already shows a small deterioration in the emission performance. Due to the higher gas density within the cylinder, the soot formation chemistry may be affected. A modification of soot formation chemistry can result in overall higher soot emissions. Another reason for the deterioration is the higher compression pressure at TDC that yields rising combustion process temperatures, which increase overall NO<sub>x</sub> emission. The PC-like nozzle configuration with HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> of 1.59 shows the greatest sensitivity on boost pressure, especially for the lowest boost condition. For that case, enhancing injection pressure to high values helps to compensate the disadvantage.</p>

<p>The formula basically depends on only two parameters: full spray angle θ and distance x between the nozzle outlet and spray tip. The relation assumes that a spray plume can be described through the combination of two geometric bodies: a circular cone and a hemisphere. The method used can also be found in Delacourt et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468087411430304">22</xref></sup> where optical spray measurements of diesel sprays at very high injection pressures (250 MPa), similar to those applied in this paper, were performed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1468087411430304">Figure 14</xref> shows the spray tip penetration for the base part load condition until piston bowl wall impingement. A larger HFR causes a faster penetration of the spray tip into the combustion chamber. The gradient of the spray velocity drop rises with decreasing HFR. The reasons for this are lower injection and momentum flow rates, which lead to a slower spray penetration.</p>

<p>The curves of V<sub>Spray</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1468087411430304">Figure 15</xref> depict a faster volume increase of the spray when the HFR is raised. Thus, a larger mass of cylinder gas is entrained into the spray. However, with rising HFR, the gas entrainment into the spray decreases relative to the injected fuel mass (λ<sub>Spray</sub>). The curves of λ<sub>Spray</sub> running on a lower level in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1468087411430304">Figure 15(b)</xref> clearly illustrate this relationship. A lower λ<sub>Spray</sub> value implies a richer fuel spray, which shows a higher tendency for soot formation. This seems to be the physical effect that explains the emission benefit of nozzles with smaller spray holes (decreased HFR) in part load operation due to the smaller overlapping of injection and combustion timing, as well as the relatively shorter interaction of spray and piston bowl wall compared to full load operation. The findings of previous studies validate the statements made.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087411430304">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087411430304">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087411430304">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087411430304">23</xref></sup></p>

<title>Effects of full load operation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1468087411430304">Figure 16</xref> displays the soot and NO<sub>x</sub> emission results attained with the base boost condition plotted versus injection pressure in full load operation. In general, the soot/NO<sub>x</sub> emissions decrease with rising injection pressure. Similar to the part load results, a limitation of the emission reduction potential of high injection pressure is not observable. This is visible by means of the continuously decreasing slopes within the complete pressure range of all curves. Again, comparable to part load operation, the gradient of the emission reduction with increasing injection pressure declines. Furthermore, the figure shows the disadvantage of a nozzle configuration at high engine speeds and loads when the HFR is too small (lower HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> ratio). A small benefit in emission performance results for the largest HFR configuration (PC-like nozzle). Base and intermediate nozzle design show a similar emission performance. The slight benefit of the intermediate nozzle results from the achievable measuring accuracy with the soot emission measurement device. The maximum deviation in emissions is 0.1 filter smoke number (FSN), which lies within the specified measuring tolerance range of the manufacturer. The clear disadvantage in emission performance of the nozzle configuration with the lowest HFR (HD-like nozzle) becomes evident comparing the curves of EGR rate and λ<sub>V</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1468087411430304">Figure 17</xref>.</p>

<p>Even through application of the highest injection pressures, it is not possible to raise the reduced EGR tolerance of that configuration to a level comparable to the one at the lowest injection pressure of the other nozzle layouts. The benefit of the largest HFR variant (HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> of 1.59) can be identified on the basis of slightly higher EGR rates and lower λ<sub>V</sub> values.</p>
<p>It becomes apparent that, under full load conditions, mixture formation benefits of small spray holes at part load conditions cannot be easily transformed, and basically other factors seem to gain influence on mixture formation and combustion. Short injection durations (sufficiently high injection rates) with compact combustion durations, as well as a high spray momentum during interaction of fuel spray and combustion chamber walls, were identified as significant parameters that determine the process of mixture formation and combustion.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1468087411430304">Figure 18</xref> shows the effects on DoC within the injection pressure range. One can observe that DoC decreases heavily with an increasing HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> ratio. The huge difference in DoC (minimum of 60%) between smallest and largest HFR configurations reveals the retarded combustion that results in the worse emission performance.</p>

The extreme difference in DoI of more than 100% between minimum and maximum HFR configuration demonstrates the effect of different injection rates on combustion. Full load engine tests were carried out at constant 50% RoHR. Therefore, the centre of combustion is fixed and constant for all configurations. However, the difference in injection rates requires different injection durations that result in different positions of the injection event (position and DoI has to be adjusted). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1468087411430304">Figure 19(b)</xref> shows the shift in EoI dependent on HFR.

The influences of different injection rates on DoI, EoI and DoC are shown with the help of the bar diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1468087411430304">Figure 20(b)</xref>. As previously mentioned, the difference in DoI between maximum and minimum HFR configuration adds up to more than 100%, and the difference in DoC still accounts for approximately 60%. The process of combustion of the minimum HFR configuration (HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> of 0.79) is indicated by a heavily overexpanded DoC in combination with a comparable low maximum heat release. This intensifies the formation of soot and deteriorates soot oxidation. Another disadvantage results from the lower spray momentum during the interaction of the fuel spray and the combustion chamber walls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087411430304">Figure 6</xref>). The emission benefit of the maximum HFR configuration results from the more compact DoC (high injection rate, short injection duration) and the therefore retarded SoI at constant 50% heat release. However, a further increase of HFR does not seem to be useful because of the slight emission benefit compared to the base (HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> of 1.19) and intermediate (HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> of 1.06) layouts. An additional decrease of DoI and increase of spray momentum would be overcompensated for by the enlargement of the spray hole outlet diameter.</p>

<title>Effect of boost pressure variation</title>
<p>Similar to the part load investigations, a boost pressure variation at full load operation has been performed. It can be expected that a variation of boost pressure will affect emission performance significantly more than in part load. Engine performance at full load reacts much more sensitively to EGR because high engine loads demand sufficient oxygen concentration levels to burn the larger fuel mass compared to part load conditions. Therefore, a change of global available oxygen level to higher (respectively, lower) concentrations therefore affects both global emission level without EGR and EGR tolerance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-1468087411430304">Figure 21</xref> depicts the effects of boost pressure variation on soot and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions at full load operation. As generally expected, increasing injection pressure improves the emission performance for all boost conditions. Furthermore, an ascending HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> ratio is beneficial for the emission results at either boost condition, as described for the base boost condition (0.305 MPa) in the paragraph above. However, compared to part load operation, a boost pressure variation significantly affects the emission performance. An increase of boost pressure from base to high conditions allows the application of higher EGR rates and thus enhances emission performance within the complete pressure range. In contrast, a boost pressure reduction to the lowest boost condition deteriorates emission performance. In particular, the nozzle configuration with the lowest HFR/V<sub>Cyl</sub> ratio of 0.79 1/min responds seriously to a boost pressure decrease. Engine operation within the boundary conditions (maximum cylinder pressure and exhaust temperature) was only possible for very high injection pressures. Despite the very high pressures, the emission performance is far worse. For this nozzle configuration, the main driver for emission performance improvement is the boost pressure level rather than increasing injection pressure level.</p>

<p>The previously introduced empirical model is used to further describe the effects resulting from varying the boost pressure at full load operation.

Furthermore, the V<sub>Spray</sub> increases. Both effects are due to the higher gas density in the cylinder that results from higher boost pressure levels. A higher gas density decelerates the spray and leads to an enlarged and wider spray plume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23-1468087411430304">Figure 23(b)</xref>).</p>

<title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>Investigations of the effects of HFR and high injection pressure on mixture formation, combustion and emission formation have been performed on a single-cylinder DI light-duty diesel engine. The desired HFR was adjusted through spray hole outlet diameter modulation. Four different nozzle configurations were designed. To generate injection pressures higher than 250 MPa, a solenoid valve controlled prototype common rail system was used. The engine tests were carried out for one part load and one full load operating point. A single-shot injection strategy was applied, so combustion noise level optimization was not within the scope of this paper. For each engine operating point, EGR variations with different injection pressure levels and boost pressure conditions were conducted. The analysis of the engine test results was performed at a constant ratio of soot and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions of 1:10. The exact values at the intersection point of the EGR variation and the imaginary 1:10 line (line with a slope of 0.1) in the soot/NO<sub>x</sub> diagram were calculated through linear interpolation.</p>
<p>On the basis of an empirical spray penetration model developed by Siebers et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411430304">10</xref></sup> a reason for the emission benefit of nozzle configurations with low hydraulic flow ratios in part load was found. Spray penetration, V<sub>Spray</sub> and mean λ<sub>V</sub> of a single spray plume were evaluated. The following major findings have been obtained.</p>
<list id="list1-1468087411430304" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In part load, a decreasing HFR, realized through spray hole outlet diameter reduction, is beneficial for soot/NO<sub>x</sub> emission performance. A limitation of the emission reduction potential of injection pressure increases within the examined injection pressure range could not be observed. However, the gradient of emission reduction potential with rising HFR increases.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The premixed fraction of combustion is expanded through both injection pressure and HFR increase. A reduction of HFR induces a more mixing-controlled diffusion-like combustion. Mixture formation velocity limits the conversion of short injection durations in reduced durations of combustion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The gas entrainment rate into the fuel spray decreases relative to the injected fuel mass with rising HFR. Thus, the fuel spray becomes richer during mixture formation and, therefore, soot formation is intensified.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The boost pressure has only a minor effect in part load on the emission performance. The highest boost condition already shows a small deterioration in the emission performance. Due to the higher gas density within the cylinder, the soot formation chemistry may be affected. A modification of soot formation chemistry can result in overall higher soot emissions. A further reason for the deterioration is the higher compression pressure at TDC that yields rising combustion process temperatures, which increase overall NO<sub>x</sub> emissions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In full load operation, the mixture formation advantage of small spray holes (low HFR) could not be observed. As determining parameters that influence mixture formation and combustion were identified: short injection durations because of high injection rates, (hence resulting compact durations of combustion) and high spray momentum during interaction of fuel spray and combustion chamber walls.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compared to part load results, boost pressure heavily affects the emission performance in full load operation. An increase of boost pressure allows the application of higher EGR rates and thus enhances emission performance within the complete investigated pressure range. In contrast, a boost pressure reduction deteriorates emission performance remarkably. Using the presented empirical spray model, it could be shown that increasing boost pressure level induces a higher gas entrainment rate into the spray and hence leads to a leaner spray. The soot formation tendency is reduced, and thus EGR tolerance is raised, which explains the enhanced emission performance of higher boost pressure levels in full load operation.</p></list-item>
