<abstract>
<p>The present article develops a new approach to intellectual history and sociology of knowledge. Its point of departure is to investigate the conditions under which social thinkers assume the iconic reputation. What does it take to become ‘a founding father’ of a humanistic discipline? How do social thinkers achieve the status of a trans-disciplinary star? Why some intellectuals attract tremendous attention and ‘go down in history’ despite personal and professional failures, while others enjoy only limited recognition or simply sink into oblivion, even if they have met all the standards of their day? Quite a few sociologists have tackled this elusive issue. Pierre Bourdieu, Michele Lamont and Randall Collins are among those who fleshed out strong explanatory frameworks. This project adds to this body of knowledge by emphasizing cultural factors that these authors downplayed in their seminal accounts, despite being aware of their significance. By showing why these underdeveloped aspects of their works need to be incorporated into the debate and how this can be achieved, this article introduces a new theorization of the iconic, lasting intellectual reputation substantiated by evidence from the lifeworks of Bronisław Malinowski and Michel Foucault. As such, it aims, minimally, to make sociology of knowledge decisively ‘cultural’. Maximally, it seeks to demonstrate that the iconic success of intellectual intervention in social theory depends on carefully performed and contingently mediated engagement with the binary systems of symbolic classification.</p>

<p>How does one emerge as ‘founding father’ of a discipline, or trans-disciplinary ‘sci-lebrity’? Are hard work and logical genius the key exigencies of intellectual iconicity? From Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge to Bourdieu’s sociology of academia to Collins’ sociology of philosophies, scholars have tackled the issue and gone beyond such lay explanatory categories. They all pointed to supra-individual factors and developed complex institutional and network models. Yet when intellectual success is swift and durable, these frameworks are not fully sufficient. When an author ‘is conspicuously successful in ruling a disciplinary world for many years’ despite her work’s ‘staggering difficulties’, an old notion of charisma may be fitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368431011423577">Strenski, 1987</xref>: 67). ‘When an author’s work has staying power beyond its immediate context, something intriguing happens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1368431011423577">Smith and Alexander, 2005</xref>: 1). This intriguing ‘something’ can be understood as <italic>iconization</italic> of intellectual pursuit. I define it as construction of symbolic authority that brings cultural resonance. Iconization is an analytic, not a normative term. The aim of this study is to unpack it. Hitherto ‘charisma’ and ‘cultural resonance’ have been more like black boxes of sociological explanation than its transparent tools. They deserve to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>It seems clear <italic>what</italic> the iconic intellectual success is. It means intellectual revelation, i.e. irrevocable transformation of relevant discourses. Iconic theories become academic ‘imagined commodities’ of sorts. When authors or works are turned into icons, they cease to be just new conspicuous nouns. They galvanize the emergence of new adjectives. That is why we talk about Foucauldian approach, functionalist method, or a Freudian slip. Yet, it is less clear <italic>how</italic> the intellectual iconicity emerges and persists as collective representation. Two premises must be stated before answering this question.</p>
<p>First, an iconic thinker is not merely an influential scholar. Gatekeepers may influence a discipline for a time but this does not guarantee the charismatic status of their teaching. Institutional situatedness rather than noetic allure distinguishes them. We can think about Coleman or Lazarsfeld in this regard, or – in terms of the case studies discussed here – about Malinowski’s mentors, Westermarck and Hobhouse, who were jointly appointed to the first sociology professorship at the University of London in 1907 but do not enjoy the ‘foundational’ reputation their student has, and about Foucault’s mentor, an École Normale Supérieure graduate Canguilhem who succeeded Bachelard at the Sorbonne in 1955, each of whom owes at least part of his impact to Foucault’s application of their ideas. As we shall see, the institutional positions that Malinowski and Foucault attained were almost homologous to those of their masters, but the recognition gap that separates them is enormous. Here teachers derive citational power from students, not the other way around, and it is precisely in this huge degree of scholarly separation where iconic force resides. In other words, the difference between <italic>intellectual iconicity</italic> and <italic>academic gatekeeping</italic> should be theoretically clarified and its sources empirically delineated. The traditional sociology of knowledge possessed too narrow a perspective to avoid conflation of the two. The language of power and influence needs to be appended with a new parlance to grasp the full scope of the phenomenon at stake.</p>
<p>Second, becoming iconic is a performative contingent success. This means that it cannot be reduced to any one set of pre-existing, materialistic conditions. Rather, it is an emergent quality of feedbacks between individual agency and collective value order. The former is creative and the latter is malleable but neither is completely open-ended. Intellectual iconicity signifies heightened authority constituted in correspondence with communities of interpretation whose responses need to be ingeniously anticipated and attention sustained because they bestow recognition. This aspect was noted from Florian Znaniecki to Mikhail Bakhtin but seldom elaborated. Even culture-sensitive sociology privileges easily operationalized institutional network factors, overlooking the fact that networks themselves are meaningful constructions, not essentialist infrastructures. Exemplifications of this problem include otherwise sophisticated theories by Pierre Bourdieu, Randall Collins, and seminal study by Michele Lamont entitled ‘How to Become a Dominant French Philosopher’.</p>
<sec id="section1-1368431011423577">
<title>The received frameworks</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368431011423577">Lamont (1987</xref>: 586) linked reputation to legitimation and defined her task as an inquiry into the conditions of legitimation of theory. Here ‘legitimation’ means a wide recognition of a theory, such that it cannot be ignored by those who define themselves and are defined as legitimate participants in the construction of a cognitive field. On closer inspection this definition is tautological because it maintains that a theory attains intellectual <italic>legitimation</italic> when it is incorporated into the sphere of <italic>legitimate</italic> debate. In other words, in spite of non-reductionist intentions, the conditions of intellectual success remain unclear. How does something become legitimate in the first place? Lamont importantly asserts that not only ‘objective’ circumstances but also ‘subjective’ self-definitions contribute to greatness (1987: 586). Thereby she problematizes purely externalist, deterministic sociological explanations. Yet she failed to theorize self-definitions as culturally mediated, audience-responsive symbolic representations. Her approach helps clarify the organizational surface but does less to plumb the symbolic depth of intellectual accomplishment. Asserting that the French intellectuals were listened to because they ‘projected charismatic image of intellectual life’ (1987: 616) is very important but leaves us wanting more in terms of how exactly the allure of such elusive things as ‘Frenchness’ or ‘charismatic image’ is constructed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368431011423577">Lamont (1987</xref>: 614) correctly suggests that intellectual legitimation depends on ‘adaptability to specific environmental requirements’. But such a model has distinct difficulty explaining iconoclastic success. Lamont stops halfway between institutional analysis and cultural sociology, even though she aims to espouse the latter.</p>
<p>Randall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368431011423577">Collins (2002</xref>: 50) offers a down-to-earth, post-positivist perspective. He argues that the reputation of social thinkers is not simply that of ‘truth-seekers’, for ‘truth as something to which one dedicates one’s life, as something rising above material interests, even above friendship, was an ideal formulated in the contentious struggles over attention space’. Yet he downplays the ideals themselves and meaning structures in which they are lodged. This failure can be attributed to his reluctance to regard symbolic patterns as significant sociological variables. He writes: ‘As sociologists we should be looking not through the lens of the myths but at the larger structure that produces those myths which is to say the formulation and long-term flow of ideas in networks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423577">Collins, 2004</xref>: 191). A more strongly cultural sociology would show that the reverse is <italic>also</italic> the case, and would examine the role of beliefs and myths in operation of the intellectual networks and decision-making processes. True, ‘star intellectuals are role models’ (2004: 195) but Collins sees roles as following mainly network advantage without systematically connecting networks to cultural patterns. By underestimating ‘deep-rooted cultural characteristics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368431011423577">Collins, 2002</xref>), he diminishes the value of thick description in the sociology of knowledge. This in turn precludes comprehension of intellectual ‘role models’ in symbolic, aesthetic and moral terms that are crucial for an understanding of the success of such powerful intellectual products as Marxism or psychoanalysis. These terms describe the <italic>Zeitgeist</italic> no less than institutions that are always symbolically saturated, and those whose works intersect with the <italic>Zeigeist</italic> ‘are most likely to be seen as central’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368431011423577">Adams et al., 2005</xref>: 7). Collins’ notion of ‘emotional energy’ is an innovative, insightful addition to the field. But it is equally important to recognize that emotional investment is connected to at least one of the ‘deep cultural plays’ of a given time. Then it is recoded into the iconic realm. It is this coding, not the original affect accessible to the privileged few that attracts broader audiences. Cultural sociology enables us not to only rectify these shortcomings and thus go beyond Lamont and Collins but to challenge Pierre Bourdieu’s famous paradigm too.</p>
<p>The language of Bourdieu’s late sociology of academia is in large part an idiom of determination and habituation with relatively little place for performative creativity and historical contingency. Here action reflects rather than inflects social structures, ‘academic language is a dead language and is no one’s mother tongue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368431011423577">Bourdieu, 1994</xref>: 8), and <italic>homo academicus</italic> is merely a ‘supreme classifier among classifiers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368431011423577">Bourdieu, 1988</xref>: xi). By replacing <italic>self</italic> with the category of <italic>body</italic>, Bourdieu overlooks how discourse displays idiosyncratic personality. He writes, ‘Cognitive structures are not forms of consciousness but dispositions of the body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368431011423577">Bourdieu, 2000</xref>: 176). Such a conception of reactive habitus has difficulty understanding subjective and cultural aspects of intellectual pursuits, for it cannot thematize either the singularity of creative character or the plurality of collective representations. Bourdieu deconstructs the social thinker mainly as ‘social position’ neglecting his or her status of a creative player of cultural roles. The cultural logic of meaning attribution seems secondary, if not downright irrelevant, especially in his later works. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368431011423577">Bourdieu (1988</xref>: xix) ‘explains’ Derrida and Foucault as ‘the heretics’ who share a fashionable anti-institutional mood. He tells us little about how such ‘heretics’ became so iconic. He takes the meaning of intellectual ‘heresy’ for granted instead of unraveling its complexities. In response to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431011423577">Bourdieu’s (1991</xref>: 105) assertion that Heidegger is ‘less the subject than the object of his most fundamental rhetorical strategies’, Lamont finds and rightly deplores ‘the same tone of fatalism that characterizes most of Bourdieu’s writings: a notion that the iron laws of society are such that they have little room for innovation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368431011423577">Lamont, 1989</xref>: 782).</p>

<title>The performative cultural framework</title>
<p>Lamont, Collins and Bourdieu offered powerful frames that are touchstones along a theoretical continuum of ever-increasing structural determinism. While each enhances our understanding of how social structure may affect intellectual iconicity, none possesses a symbolic theory on a par with their systematic materialist and institutionalist claims. This state of the field was critically assessed by Edward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1368431011423577">Said (1996</xref>: 13) when he wrote: ‘There has been far too much defining of the intellectual, and not enough stock taken of the image, the signature, the actual intervention and performance.’</p>
<p>The present article responds to this hitherto unheeded call. It points to the partially contingent ascription of value to a pursuit that openly and radically shifts the symbolic designations of given communities. The combination of propitious context and felicitous performance can unleash fresh symbolic forces of such magnitude that sometimes they can even override logical or material/structural considerations. Such pursuits stand out as archetypes of radical novelty and/or liberating dissent, and remain reckoned with, despite the professional or personal failures of their authors. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1368431011423577">Table 1</xref> heuristically systematizes a set of contrasts that the present approach raises vis-à-vis received frameworks. In other words, the present article adds a new dimension to the field and aims to reinsert voluntaristic element into its core. Yet it does so via the concept of cultural performance which places individual agency within the web of collective representations that elude both perfect individual control and hegemonic institutional power. What does this move entail?</p>

<p>I would argue that the emergence of iconic, archetypical intellectual pursuits can be modeled with three general factors: (1) liminal time; (2) charisma process; and (3) the cultural coding of the sacred and profane. The first denotes period perceived as transitional, i.e. social temporality rather than chronological time. As such, ‘liminal time’ means a degree of intellectual confusion and a corresponding openness to guidance. As a result, a cultural, not simply economic or institutional, space for an intellectual intervention is created.</p>
<p>The second factor refers to cultural and affective consequences of non-routine, aura-laden, performatively constructed social authority of a particular person. The point is that charisma is made, not born. It arises out of mutually constitutive relations between individual and groups. Charisma is thus not a ‘gift of nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368431011423577">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>: 1); it is an emergent social effect. But how exactly is it enacted in social practice?</p>
<p>One of the answers refers to the third element – the cultural coding of the sacred and profane. Iconic authors have ‘unusual sensitivity to the sacred’, develop ‘fascination’ with it, and strive for ‘intimate contact’ with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1368431011423577">Shils, 1982</xref>: 180, 194). They are the ones who aspire to make bold, often emancipatory statements about human condition, some explicitly (e.g. Arendt), others more subtly (e.g. Habermas). They invariably wish to extend ‘human freedom’ as they broaden our knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1368431011423577">Said, 1996</xref>: 17). To do it effectively they define ‘polluted’ intellectual no-go zones and mobilize the resources of ideational ‘purity’. They propose a new distribution of the sacred and profane by ‘explaining our time’ in normative and expressive ways that directly engage ‘not only what we know but what we believe, hope and fear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368431011423577">Alexander, 2003</xref>: 196).</p>
<p>Typically this action is a response to what is coded as failure of previous intellectuals to solve issues identified as vital. Performatively compelling deployment of the master binary requires careful use of more specific dichotomies such as order/chaos, interesting/boring, us/them, familiar/other. Especially the figure of the other, often construed as ‘weak’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1368431011423577">Said, 1996</xref>: 22) or ‘subaltern’ (in the work of Gramsci and Bhabha) is culturally potent. It constitutes also an extraordinarily portable cultural category, for it can be found almost anywhere: outside one’s own civilization (e.g. Malinowski’s ‘savages’), inside it but among the excluded (e.g. Foucault’s mentally ill, Butler’s queers), or across major political and economic cleavages (e.g. Marx’s proletariat). When interrogating the other is about shifting the existing distribution of the sacred and profane, the possibility of iconic intellectual pursuit is created. The publics of liminal times are responsive to such shifting of articulation of frontiers between the valid and invalid, the familiar and odd, the normal and abnormal, the dominant and subjugated.</p>
<p>The successful enactment of iconic intellectual pursuit hinges on at least four factors associated with an author’s cultural self-understanding. They are: (1) symbolic (dis)association; (2) intellectual (dis)ambiguation; (3) semiotic condensation; and (4) creative aesthetization. Each one is based on what I call general values and specific qualities. The first is about series of affirmative and critical engagements with the authors who can be defined as key. Social theory is often a vehicle of social identity that balances between the belonging value and the contrast value that are constituted by familiarity qualities and diacritic qualities respectively. The second type of action refers to demonstrating what a theory is about. We deal here with the field value constituted by thematic qualities. This aspect should not be mistaken for clarity of positioning oneself. A degree of vagueness may in fact add quasi-mysterious qualities. Similarly, a degree of shock quality connected to specific research field may endorse iconicity. The third type refers to the need for the emblem value, i.e. the feature that establishes a social theory as a brand. Not only staging one’s standpoint vis-à-vis existing actors but also generating sign-like ideas is indispensable for strong recognition. Semiotic qualities play here an important role. Finally, the fourth type refers to the style value of a discourse constituted by the presence of idiosyncratic formal qualities. Yet, style as an aesthetic commitment is not merely a formal issue in a traditional sense; it is a message too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1368431011423577">White, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1368431011423577">Table 2</xref> summarizes this scheme.</p>

<title>Intellectual performances in action</title>
<p>In order to substantiate my claims, I analyze the lifeworks of Malinowski and Foucault. The choice of two cases instead of one is deliberate. I believe that the heuristic value of such a juxtaposition outweighs the obvious deficiencies of an article-long treatment. Collating seemingly disparate works rooted in different national traditions reveals common performative patterns, at least as far as the Western world is concerned. Both thinkers represent different fields, different concerns, and perhaps different levels of iconicity too. Yet their lifeworks evince significant similarities at the level of meaning construction. To examine both lifeworks means comparing exemplary twentieth-century intellectual careers that irrevocably changed entrenched discourses and spawned new academic disciplines.</p>
<p>Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that they worked in different historical periods, there are some curious biographical parallels. Both thinkers attained their own distinguished chairs (LSE and Collège de France) when they were only 43, i.e. at the peak of their creative powers. They died untimely at the same age of 58 by which time they were already intellectual legends. Each one came originally from a relatively provincial milieu but quickly made it to European centers of intellectual life (London and Paris). Subsequently, each spent a considerable time in other environments before returning to those centers to assume independent academic positions. In the mature stages of their careers both sojourned to the US to influence directly its key audiences of the time (lectured at Yale and Berkeley). Crucially, both thinkers fleshed out their flagship statements around historical junctures of the European past (World War I and 1968). These statements reappraised such key Western symbolic binaries as ‘rational/irrational’, ‘normal/abnormal’ or ‘familiar/other’.</p>
<p>As indicated above, the performative framework predicts that revaluation of such key binaries requires displacing other iconic figures who are believed to uphold them. Both thinkers did this. Their lifeworks feature surprisingly similar, rather explicit ‘eschatological’ agendas derived from these revaluations. Eventually, the two quickly shifted from the status of leaders to (re)founding figures. Although academic in spirit, their styles responded not only to scientific but to artistic imperatives too. Like Picasso, an icon of twentieth-century art, they were not ‘searching’, they were ‘finding’.</p>
<sec id="section4-1368431011423577">
<title>Malinowski</title>
<p>Bronisław Malinowski (1884–1942) was born and raised in Kraków, and earned his PhD there. He studied also in Leipzig and London. During World War I he conducted a pioneering field research on the indigenous culture of the Trobriand Islands. The publication of his book <italic>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</italic> in 1922 made him famous. Five years later, Malinowski received the first chair of anthropology at the London School of Economics. His years in London cemented his reputation as a ‘founding father’ of modern cultural anthropology. In 1942, he gained a professorship at Yale. This success followed an honorary degree from Harvard. He died before he could scientifically capitalize on these positive developments but his iconic stature was already well entrenched.</p>
<p>How did he become so successful so quickly? How was this improbable trajectory possible? Malinowski’s intellectual pursuit became iconic not because of the structural assets which by international standards were hardly impressive in his formative years. True, the minimal network conditions were met, especially by being the son of a university professor and through his early connection to Charles Seligman. But if these could be seen as necessary, they certainly were not sufficient for what he eventually achieved. One needs to examine the fusion of the symbolic properties of his actions and the cultural background of his time that carried the day. His charisma may have been partly linked to his contacts with famous Western intellectuals of his era like Wilhelm Wundt, Edward Westermarck, or Leonard Hobhouse. But to get there in the first place from a Polish province of the increasingly decentered Habsburg Empire, he needed to overcome numerous cultural hurdles and promote himself more intensively than his talented British peers.</p>
<p>No doubt, his ‘genius’ consisted in being bold and making it seem effortless. Unlike other contemporaneous masters of cultural theory, for example, Cassirer, Malinowski ‘freely and explicitly asserted himself in the arena of public issues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368431011423577">Strenski, 1987</xref>: 43). Yet it was the <italic>kind</italic> of boldness he employed that helped catapult him to intellectual stardom. He engaged headlong with the key cultural binaries and creatively shifted the traditional referents of the sacred and profane prevalent not only in his discipline but in modern society in general:<disp-quote>
<p>[Malinowski] boldly stormed the redoubts of intellectualism and Idealism in culture, instead of merely seeking easy victories in areas of culture more easily recognized as actions … The boldness of the enterprise had the further advantage of drawing much-needed attention and so enhancing his reputation in the avant-garde scientific community. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368431011423577">Strenski, 1987</xref>: 61)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This is one of the key linkages: daring statement addressed to avant-garde audience.</p>
<p>However, the strategically masterminded story of Malinowski’s intervention is marked at its inception by a symbolically charged coincidence. Interestingly, his early and most important book hit the market exactly when the distinguished British ethnologist William Rivers died. Malinowski had been explicit about his dissatisfaction with Rivers and intent on symbolically ‘contaminating’ the Cambridge professor as the traditionalist gatekeeper. He was establishing this contrast value between himself and Rivers quite systematically. In the letter to Mrs Seligman, he complained that Rivers’ magnum opus ‘reads like Rider Haggard rather than like Joseph Conrad’ (21 June 1918). It is significant that Malinowski cared to do that at the time when ‘even Oxford and Cambridge dons were not principally known in the public domain as intellectuals in the French sense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1368431011423577">Said, 1996</xref>: 67). But what is perhaps even more compelling is that he deemed it significant to undermine Rivers not only on scientific but also aesthetic grounds. Clearly, for Malinowski the form of scientific work was worth as much critical attention as the substance of institutional power that backs it.</p>
<p>In the end, the ethnological interregnum in Britain was hardly noticeable because Malinowski’s study quickly ‘achieved authoritative force’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368431011423577">Marcus and Fischer, 1999</xref>: 55). After nearly a century of critical debates, Rivers is hardly known, recalled mainly in his native country and mostly due to his ‘expeditions’ and ‘experiments’, whereas Malinowski lives on as ‘The Father of Social Anthropology’. <sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368431011423577">1</xref>
</sup> Although contemporary anthropologists may now doubt the book’s legendary description as ‘the beginning of modern professional ethnography’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1368431011423577">Sahlins, 2000</xref>: 524), they nevertheless acknowledge its staying power of a trope by using it in this capacity for their own theoretical purposes. We know that the transition to the modern ethnographic method was complex. Yet ‘one anthropologist is now remembered by both American and British anthropologists as the founder of the method: Bronisław Malinowski’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368431011423577">Marcus and Fischer, 1999</xref>: 19). What initially may have been the intellectual partnership between Malinowski and his British colleagues became almost his individual ownership. Internationally, he is considered one of the ‘classics’ of cultural scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368431011423577">Bachmann-Medick, 2007</xref>: 148). Why and how did this come to be?</p>
<p>First, the book served as a self-conscious manifesto, not just an exemplary case study. As such, it was a plea to alter thinking about society and ‘human nature’. Crucially, Malinowski undermined the then common view that ‘savages’ had very few, if any, social conventions. Moreover, with <italic>Argonauts</italic>, he demonstrated how the meaning of non-use items, such as shells, did not significantly differ from the crown jewels of the European nations. In his view, they were all equally about emphasizing status and prestige, i.e. fulfilling the same ‘cultural functions’. The new theory could not be easily dismissed because Malinowski arrived at it ‘off the verandah’, with hard evidence in his hands collected during years of remote fieldwork. He grounded his claims in the empirical authority of a single statement: I have lived there. It was thus not only the evidence itself but also the way in which it was garnered and packaged. As Ivan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368431011423577">Strenski (1987</xref>: 45, emphasis in original) noted, ‘what distinguished Malinowski was his skill at <italic>selling</italic> fieldwork’, and he concludes: ‘In one sweeping gesture Malinowski throws open the theoretical windows and exposes us to the refreshing open air of the anthropological field.’</p>
<p>He also wanted his theory to live up to the name – it was couched in general language even if its raw material was quite specific. It was precisely as a theorist that Malinowski appeared to be an <italic>agent provocateur</italic> who challenged the well-entrenched discourses of his time and dared to speak about humanity as such. After him, only one anthropologist was audacious enough to work this way, Lévi-Strauss, and he too achieved international iconicity.</p>
<p>For all its programmatic character, Malinowski’s approach was very eclectic. His discourse played with paradoxes and evinced at once a serious and playful approach to the received systems of thought. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368431011423577">Gellner (1998</xref>: 135) pointed out, Malinowski’s program was an ‘impossible’ combination: ‘He was an empiricist organicist, a positivist romantic, and a synchronic holist … all these alignments were new … here was someone who had altogether reshuffled the cards and had come out with a coherent hand that no one had ever played before.’ It mattered that radical ‘synchronic’ empiricism and functionalist questions were ‘exciting in their day, contrasting sharply with the projects of nineteenth-century anthropological thought’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368431011423577">Marcus and Fischer, 1999</xref>: 27). In disciplinary terms, Malinowski caught a historical wave of changes in cultural scholarship – the continued success of his work seems ‘part of the much more general success of the so-called <italic>scientific</italic> model of anthropology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368431011423577">Strenski, 1987</xref>: 67). This in turn was a part of the broader intellectual climate of the 1920s in which ‘sci-lebrities’, the scientific stars – from Einstein to Freud – both added to and benefited from the growing prestige of science.</p>
<p>While respectful of many of these coeval developments, Malinowski saw himself as an important competitor in the game and from the very beginning of his academic career he made sure to work out his own critical stance on them. Perhaps most famously, he began ‘the well-known and inexhaustible debate’ about universalism of the Oedipus complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368431011423577">Deleuze and Guattari, 2000</xref>: 171), seriously undermining Freud’s fashionable notion. He made it a point to dismiss Durkheim’s seminal <italic>The Elementary Forms of Religious Life</italic> upon its publication. Later as a teacher in London, he would persuade others, notably visiting Talcott Parsons, to ignore it as ‘simply unscientific’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368431011423577">Johnston, 1995</xref>: 94), even though his work bore clear traces of the profound influence of the French sociologist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368431011423577">Strenski, 1987</xref>: 52). In other words, he tried and succeeded in scoring well both at the level of symbolic (dis)association and intellectual (dis)ambiguation.</p>
<p>At the same time, he was successful at the level of semiotic condensation. Contrast value and field value were buttressed by the emblematic character of his scientific stance, ‘functionalism’. Additionally, he pioneered hugely influential linguistic concepts via a full version of ‘what was later called the theory of <italic>performative</italic> use of language, except he called it <italic>phatic</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368431011423577">Gellner, 1998</xref>: 148). He was one of the first to maintain that language is not just ‘an instrument of reflection but a mode of action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1368431011423577">Malinowski, 1960</xref>: 315–16). Malinowski quite literally lived his theory. Meanwhile, theory took on a life of its own. Its originality was best described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368431011423577">Gellner (1998</xref>: 149): ‘Malinowski formulated the key idea of ‘Philosophical Investigations’ almost in Wittgenstein’s words at the time when the latter was still sunk in the darkness of “Tractatus”.’ Interestingly, nearly a century later this legacy is still being recalled as ‘a famous case’ for contextual analysis of culture congenial to fashionable postmodern strands of Western academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1368431011423577">Simpson, 2002</xref>: 51).</p>
<p>Malinowski applied his eclectic program to the flagship analysis of gift in the exchange system of Kula, a cultural phenomenon that continues to matter both for its native carriers and Western anthropologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368431011423577">Campbell, 2002</xref>). Only a year later, in 1923, a Durkheimian, Marcel Mauss, published his important monograph ‘The Gift’ that later influenced many French theorists from Bataille to Derrida. Mauss drew on Malinowski and this acknowledgement meant more international exposure of <italic>Argonauts</italic> and functionalism. Conceptually Malinowski’s approach provided an intellectual fusion of the material and symbolic aspects of social life. The previously reigning evolutionary paradigm had been coded as the ‘polluted’ effort due to its naïve diachronic assumptions. Instead, an unlikely but compelling synchronic approach was proposed. It was a felicitous intervention into the discourses confused by the plethora of curiosity-driven studies and speculative historicism of which William Rivers was the epitome, in Malinowski’s view. Here again Malinowski chose a strategy of stigmatizing classical works as ‘not fully scientific’, i.e. profane. This attitude is stated in his letter to Johan Huizinga: ‘I have been very anxious to change anthropology from a mixtum compositum of all sorts of things including archaeology and collectioneering into a definite social science with a sociological and practical aim’ (Malinowski, 13 July 1931).</p>
<p>With such a toolkit of contrast, field and emblem values, Malinowski appeared well equipped to ‘explain it all’. Moreover, he managed to convey this message to manifold audiences. He accomplished it not only by persuading people that it was scientifically beneficial to refresh cultural scholarship. He dramatized his performance by maintaining that it was really a ‘last moment’ for a ‘new’ grand narrative. In the closing paragraph of <italic>Argonauts</italic>, he writes:<disp-quote>
<p>The study of Ethnology might become one of the most deeply philosophic, enlightening and elevating disciplines of scientific research. Alas! The time is short for Ethnology and will this truth of its real meaning and importance dawn before it is too late? (1961: 518)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>He played simultaneously with the binary motifs of the dawn of a new science and the twilight of its social opportunities. For Malinowski, anthropology was not just a science, it was a movement, and <italic>Argonauts</italic> was not just a treatise but also a <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> in which the protagonist was the author himself.</p>
<p>The book conceived thus satisfied new scientific expectations but it also met the broader demands of that time. The former were partly prepared by Malinowski’s mentors who were uneasy with yet partly indebted to the preceding ethnographical production. Malinowski’s was the generation that happened to be in a felicitous network position to leave traditional views for good. The demands of the time were connected to the post-war reconstruction climate under which the British Empire needed to decisively shift its colonial policies from direct to ‘indirect rule’. Since it did not yet quite possess sufficient intellectual and symbolic tools to realizethat transition smoothly, the anthropological expertise gained new salience, at least in principle. Malinowski viewed it as an opportunity. His functionalist revolution needs to be interpreted in this context too, for it expressed his ‘desire to convince the colonial administration that they needed anthropologists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368431011423577">Strenski, 1987</xref>: 57). So marketed, Malinowski’s work and its intentions could hardly fail to be noticed. However, it was not yet enough to be ‘iconized’. A kind of shock quality and idiosyncratic style qualities proved indispensable.</p>
<p>Devoting his studies to such topics as the sexuality of ‘savages’, war, or native law and crime, Malinowski riveted broader attention. The impact was amplified by the fact that in the 1920s ‘savagery was synonymous with absurd, cruel, and eccentric customs, with quaint superstitions and revolting practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368431011423577">Malinowski, 1929</xref>: 1). Neatly explaining what appeared to be a ‘chaotic’ or ‘wild’ behavior paid off, especially as it referred to the spheres of intimacy and social taboo. At that time these thematic choices possessed shock potential and high mystery value, especially in British society that was relatively exposed to ‘exoticism’ via its wide colonial network. This potential was recognized by the BBC with which Malinowski collaborated and which entered the public sphere in the same year <italic>Argonauts</italic> appeared.</p>
<p>Moreover, Malinowski sought to work out an engaging and provocative parlance in which to couch his arguments. He was a storyteller. The mobilization of symbolic codes associated with the ‘sacred’ figure of writer Joseph Conrad was by no means accidental. It forged important associations and helped ‘pollute’ a hero of the previous era, Rivers. Malinowski did not hide his ambition to ‘become the Conrad of anthropology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368431011423577">Firth, 1957</xref>: 6). He promoted himself as the ‘outsider’ who was up to this task and whose mission was to intellectually shake the ‘center’, and link seemingly incommensurate national traditions. Even years later Malinowski still perceived himself ‘as the link between the French point of view and the British’ and claimed that ‘as a Pole was almost a Frenchman in his sentiments’ (letter to Mr Labouret, 4 February 1933).</p>
<p>Drawing on Conrad, a great novelist and fellow expatriate Pole, Malinowski sought to ‘bestow a great care on style’ (letter to Charles Seligman, 21 January 1919). To this day Malinowski is celebrated as one of those key intellectuals whose ‘eloquence and sheer brilliance’ promoted the concept of <italic>culture</italic> so well that it seemed ‘like an all-seasons explanation for anything human beings might contrive to do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423577">Geertz, 2000a</xref>: 12). Malinowski himself saw his work as an art of ‘generalization’, believing that ‘to a really scientific mind facts do not matter a bit’ (letter to Charles Seligman, 21 January 1919). According to historian Harry Payne, Malinowski succeeded in his pursuit because he managed to combine the novelistic qualities with the symbolic value of scientific discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368431011423577">Payne, 1981</xref>: 438). Malinowski’s informal words support this contention. In the undated letter to Maria Syemionovna, he wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>The craft of the anthropologist, like that of the pianist, must embody something of the fullness of human life. Reason alone is not enough … In scientific approach to human life cold reason and experiments or empirical observations are not sufficient. The artist must have as much to say as the scientist.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The reviews of <italic>Argonauts</italic> suffice as evidence of Malinowski’s performative success (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368431011423577">Kubica-Heller 2001</xref>). Alfred Haddon, an anthropologist from Cambridge, published a review in <italic>Nature</italic>, claiming that a young scholar produced an ‘absolutely first class work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368431011423577">Haddon, 1922</xref>: 473–4). Francis Rickman Barton, the last British governor of New Guinea and lay ethnologist, wrote in an influential journal <italic>Man</italic>, that Malinowski’s first book fully supports his reputation of a strong anthropologist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368431011423577">1922</xref>: 189–90). Wilhelm Koppers, the first Professor of Anthropology at the University of Vienna, regarded the work as one of the most important and most valuable interventions of that time despite his diffusionist allegiance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368431011423577">1923</xref>: 585–7). Malinowski’s work was also well received beyond ethnology, especially in economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1368431011423577">Schwiedland, 1923</xref>: 558–60; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368431011423577">Ginsberg, 1924</xref>: 239–41). All these scholars appreciated the contrast value and field value of Malinowski’s pursuit. Some admired the work because of its emblem value. Malinowski’s greatest rival at that time, Radcliffe-Brown admitted in a letter of 6 November 1922: ‘I am not at all sure that I was not a little envious that you had said things that I ought to have said in my Andaman book.’</p>
<p>Finally, the idiosyncratic qualities of <italic>Argonauts</italic>, i.e. Malinowski’s signature style value, offset a certain lack of coherence and rigor that the critics emphasized. This formal aspect was important because substantial accusations were formidable. Franz Boas castigated him for what Malinowski deemed the anthropological virtue – generalizations. The ‘savages’ were not simply the ‘primitive’ people. Nonetheless, even the severest of those critics admitted that his literary talent was extraordinary. Clyde Kluckhohn emphasized his skills to ‘dramatize a field work’; others, like Robert Redfield, identified a key element of Malinowski’s success when they pointed out that ‘no other author of our times achieved more than Malinowski in a task of synthesis of the warmth of reality of human life with cold abstractions of science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1368431011423577">Symonolewicz-Symmons, 1985</xref>: 87). This kind of response was common and appreciated by different scholars from James Frazer to Talcott Parsons. The latter wrote that Malinowski ‘was at his best as a theorist when tried to give humanly understandable meaning to behavior which the reader would otherwise find bizarre and unfathomable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368431011423577">Firth, 1957</xref>: 54). His intellectual stuff was received as ‘rich and atmospheric’ because <italic>Argonauts</italic> reads at times like the screenplay of a true-to-life, yet romantic, jungle travelogue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368431011423577">Strenski, 1987</xref>: 45). No wonder then that Margaret Mead was not the only one to think that Malinowski was the ‘godfather’ of the field (Morey, 1934).</p>
<p>Regardless of specific professional objections to Malinowski’s work, the excitement about his writings translated into popular respect because the majority of audiences realized that it was Malinowski’s questions, not necessarily his answers that pushed social theory beyond the point of no return. Malinowski was one of the first to seriously interrogate the ossified social scientific binaries of the fluid post-World War I times. In his <italic>Magic</italic>, <italic>Science and Religion</italic>, like Mary Douglas, he ‘wrestled’ with a myth of grand sociological synthesis, ‘bringing inner and outer, private and public, personal and social, psychological and historical, experiential and behavioral into intelligible relationship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423577">Geertz, 2000a</xref>: 204). To ask difficult questions about these binaries ‘became part of anthropological common sense in the twentieth century’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368431011423577">Marcus and Fischer, 1999</xref>: 28). Turning ‘impossible’ novelty into ‘commonsensical’ cultural repertoire boosts intellectual iconicity; it rendered Malinowski a ‘cultural prophet’, of interest to the BBC and fellow academics alike. The ‘salvational’ thrust of his questions mattered more than his errors. In the end, when respected colleagues like Edmund Leach asserted that Malinowski’s success was not based on rational premises but on his prophetic qualities, they added to rather than subtracted from his reputation.</p>
<p>No doubt part of this prophetic charisma stemmed from prolonged ‘ascetic’ immersion into the local culture and mastering its language. Many of Malinowski’s peers felt entitled to view him as a priest of a new science. Subsequent generations of ethnologists did too. Adam Kuper uses this trope to explain his authority. He sees Malinowski’s lifework as ‘exemplary tale of a prophet: false start, then the illness and conversion, followed by migration; the earth-shattering calamity – no less than a world war – leading to isolation in wilderness; the return with a message; the battle of the disciples’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1368431011423577">Young, 2004</xref>: xix). This response is significant because it attests to lifework’s symbolic entanglements. It shows that audiences respond through projection no less than through analysis; network advantage alone could not guarantee iconic status – self-conscious image, meaningful personal narrative and felicitously positioned symbolic performance mattered too. Though Malinowski was indeed a frail person, obsessed with ‘delivering a message’ to the suddenly brutalized West (letter to Charles Seligman, 21 January 1919), his academic start can hardly be viewed as ‘false’. Likewise, this specific link between the war calamity and his isolation can only be narrated in suggestive, not conclusive terms. However, Kuper’s interpretation, like Leach’s, is not implausible because at various levels Malinowski actively sought to establish his ‘prophecy’, to offer a radical message to humanity, not just a coherent theory to fellow anthropologists. No less than the trope of Socratic wisdom was employed to achieve it. As he made plain in <italic>Argonauts</italic>, ‘there is one point of view deeper yet and more important than the love of tasting of the variety of human modes of life, and that is the desire to turn such knowledge into wisdom’ (1961: 517). This ‘salvational’ perspective amplified by the ancient reference is conspicuous in the conclusion:<disp-quote>
<p>Our final goal is to enrich and deepen our own world’s vision, to understand our own nature and to make it finer, intellectually and artistically. In grasping the essential outlook of others we cannot but help widening our own. We cannot possibly reach final Socratic wisdom of knowing ourselves if we never leave the narrow confinement of the customs, beliefs and prejudices into which every man is born. (1961: 518)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This plea fused several intellectual signifiers such as rationalism, enlightenment and aestheticization of existence. It is a sample of salvational, carefully staged and performed intellectual pursuit. First, there is a powerful intellectual background code of ‘ultimate wisdom’. Second, there is a semiotic condensation of intellectual aspirations achieved with the reference to Socrates, one that fulfills the promise of the literary title ‘evocative of classical Greece’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368431011423577">Strenski, 1987</xref>: 45). Third, there are elements of strategic aestheticization, such as invocation of the sublime character of such notions as ‘final goal’ or ‘world’s vision’, or the explicitly stated ambition to fuse the intellectual (analytical) with the artistic (expressive).</p>
<p>As years of critical debates have bestowed dense layers of meanings attached to Malinowski’s œuvre, the story of his iconic success appears more than anything else a return of the romantic myth of intellectual leadership that makes a difference. Raymond Firth, one of Malinowski’s disciples, openly claimed that Malinowski was not really a systematic theorist but a ‘romantic thinker’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1368431011423577">Symonolewicz-Symmons, 1985</xref>: 85). As a matter of fact, ‘Malinowski confessed in one of his early articles that anthropology was once for him a romantic escape from Western over-standardized culture. A new anthropology could be perceived as just another factor of Western disenchantment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1368431011423577">Symonolewicz-Symmons, 1985</xref>: 86). This disenchantment reverberated strongly in the liminal situation of World War I and its aftermath. Malinowski commented on this situation in <italic>Argonauts</italic> by introducing the figure of the other:<disp-quote>
<p>Nothing can teach us better lesson in this matter of ultimate importance than the habit of mind which allows us to treat the beliefs and values of another man from his point of view. Nor has civilized humanity ever needed such tolerance more than now … when all the ideals, cherished and proclaimed as the highest achievements of civilization, science and religion, have been thrown to the winds. (1961: 518)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>By setting forth a systematic generalized account of the ‘savage society’ when modernist Europe was just recovering from its military savagery, Malinowski happened to strike the right note. His assiduous graphic descriptions of seemingly irrational ‘natives’ helped put both the political follies and rationalist quests of Europe in a different light. The functional approach was instrumental in this task. His unfamiliar but intelligibly packaged story could be viewed as a deep commentary on Western modernity that just entered ‘crucial moment of its history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1368431011423577">Riley, 2005</xref>: 289). This moment consisted in ‘the West’s full entry into a modernity characterized most centrally by the disappearance of traditional cultural responses to deep questions of personal meaning and identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1368431011423577">Riley, 2005</xref>: 289).</p>
<p>Malinowski’s intervention fitted perfectly this intellectual climate. Even if critical or incredulous, most of his audiences were impressed by the thrust of his message and identified with it. Conversely, the most silent of all audiences, the Trobrianders, could not recognize themselves in his work, even though they did not impugn its facticity. Even for very radical readers, the understanding of the ‘primitive’ was not only about freeing the ‘savages’ from the increasingly polluted, direct colonization of their lifeworlds but also about freeing the West from certain hitherto sacred beliefs it had about itself. What mattered for Westerners was that Malinowski questioned otherness in more sophisticated terms and compellingly illuminated the unrecognizably brutalized familiar. They <italic>wanted</italic> to believe in Malinowski’s own explicit belief that ‘perhaps through realizing human nature in a shape very distant and foreign to us, we shall have some light shed on our own’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368431011423577">Malinowski, 1961</xref>: 25). Having been <italic>there</italic> and showing its significance <italic>here,</italic> the anthropologist could claim at once authenticity and practicality. And contemporaneous intellectual Western circles were more often impressed than skeptical. A confession of Bertrand Russell (8 November 1928) from his letter to Malinowski confirms that: ‘I admire very much your endurance in being willing to live so long among savages.’</p>
<p>The circles of those who so admired Malinowski shrank upon the publication of his field diary in 1967. Malinowski might have contemplated the possibility of its posthumous publication that could constitute his last provocative performance of great shock value. In one of the letters to Boas, he even remarked: ‘It is a very good thing if people do not leave any material unpublished’ (6 April 1934). These words were uttered in a specific context and the precise meaning of the ‘material’ is not defined but given Malinowski’s romantic self-fashioning, one cannot completely exclude their relevance here.</p>
<p>
<italic>Diary</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1368431011423577">Malinowski, 2001</xref>) hit hard because it seemed to mock the role of researcher. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1368431011423577">Malinowski (2001</xref>: 520) unapologetically spoke about his intermittent problems with lack of empathy and about sheer ‘longing for civilization’. He appeared to be harping on ‘being irritated’ by the loud laughter of the natives or sporadic feelings of ‘generally loathing them’ (2001: 503, 522). He also made sarcastic remarks about anthropology, such as the one from 21 December 1917: ‘This is going to be my last ethnographic prank. Then I will devote myself to a constructive sociology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1368431011423577">Malinowski, 2001</xref>: 520).</p>
<p>Predictably, <italic>Diary</italic> made him infamous as quickly as his <italic>Argonauts</italic> had made him a godfather of anthropology. The scholarly community seemed overwhelmed by dismay. Especially in the US, his legitimation waned. Geertz initially ridiculed it. However, twenty years later, he went back to the topic and admitted that theorizing society, especially its ‘unfamiliar faces’, is about a hard fight against insubordination of one’s own thoughts. He emphasized that being an anthropologist always involves combating one’s psychic weaknesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368431011423577">Geertz, 2000b</xref>: 110). Extraordinary hypocrisy has been recoded into typical ambiguity:<disp-quote>
<p>Although it scandalized the profession in the late 1960s and helped precipitate a crisis of anthropological conscience in the 1970s, the ‘Diary’ became an iconic text that endorsed the postmodern and post-colonial preoccupations of subsequent decades, serving as a charter for a more self-consciously reflexive and interpretative anthropology. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1368431011423577">Young, 2004</xref>: xxi)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The scandal and its evolving reception symbolized yet another change in distribution of the sacred and profane among researchers and their audiences. <italic>Diary</italic> had the effect of inspiring honest cultural auto-critique in post-positivist mode. This reflexivity was epitomized by Leszek Kolakowski’s statement that ‘[the] modern thinker who has never once suspected himself of being a charlatan must be such a shallow mind that his work is probably not worth reading’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368431011423577">1988</xref>: 1). Therefore, <italic>Diary</italic> became valuable not because it was a ‘true version of “Argonauts”’ but because of the light it shed on the official side of social scientific activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368431011423577">Clifford, 1988</xref>: 97). It is a journal of intellectual liminality that reveals the processes of consolidation of thinker’s mind. When created, <italic>Diary</italic> played a cathartic role of self-analysis of a fledgling author. When revealed, it gradually assumed a cathartic role of a self-analysis of the whole meaning-formation called social anthropology. According to Clifford, the drama of <italic>Diary</italic> demonstrates that Malinowski’s intellectual pursuit was indeed ‘staged but also truthful, a pose but nonetheless authentic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368431011423577">Clifford, 1988</xref>). A perfect paradox.</p>

<title>Foucault</title>
<p>‘Do not ask me who I am and do not ask me to remain the same. Leave it to our bureaucrats and police to see that our papers are in order’ (Foucault, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368431011423577">Ingram, 2003</xref>: 241). This statement by Michel Foucault perfectly exudes his charismatic stature, contempt for routinization, and ironic attitude towards established authorities. As a social thinker, Foucault was not merely an iconoclastic figure; he was an iconic intellectual of the second half of the twentieth century, one who ‘prominently occupies our shared recollection of intellectuals in the time when we tend to forget how widespread their audiences once were’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368431011423577">Judt, 2008</xref>: 13). Critics emphasized his intellectual improbability – ahistorical historism, anti-humanist humanism, and anti-structural structuralism. He was a master of paradoxes and reversals in the times of intense social revaluations.</p>
<p>Foucault (1926–1984) was trained as a philosopher. He studied under Canguilhem but such scholars as Bachelard shaped his early interests too. We also know that at that time Foucault was ‘severely depressed’ and that his father arranged a psychiatric consultation for him (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1368431011423577">Whitebook, 2003</xref>: 315). As a student, Foucault was a friend of Althusser who influenced him to join the French Communist Party in 1950. However, he left it in 1953. This early, relatively brief affair with communism in its intellectual and organizational guises is symptomatic. On the one hand, a young independent-minded modern French intellectual with ambitions to contest the received order could hardly make a different choice of iconoclastic allegiance. It certainly put him in touch with representative types of the critical, so-called ‘progressive’ intelligentsia. On the other hand, it might have been precisely this rigid polarization of the ideological scene and Marxism’s own brittle orthodoxies that ultimately convinced him of the necessity to transform the traditional binary of right and left, and the classical notion of the political to which the leftist thinkers of his time still clung. Commenting on the far left at that time, Edward Shils noted ‘the similarity of patterns of thought of the soi-disant left and the right-wing fanatics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1368431011423577">Shils, 1982</xref>: xx). Foucault may have sensed this more acutely than ‘many intelligent and educated people’ who, like himself, ‘were taken in by Althusser and his manic fancies’ at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368431011423577">Judt, 2008</xref>: 114). Certainly, Foucault’s main works provide ample evidence that he transcended classical ideological binaries and thematized new ones.</p>
<p>However, he still needed some inspiration and the backing of individuals and collectivities that could offer a sense of support for an alternative direction. His later friendship with Gilles Deleuze and his association with the avant-garde literary journal <italic>Tel Quel</italic>, founded in Paris in 1960, played such roles. One may also conjecture that it was the general Durkheimian effervescence rather than the specific Marxist content of the 1968 student uprising in Paris that influenced Foucault’s attitudes more profoundly. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011423577">Foucault (2000</xref>: xi) admitted, not without certain irony, ‘during 1945–1965 there was a certain way of thinking correctly … one had to be on familiar terms with Marx, not let one’s dreams stray too far from Freud … Then came the five brief, impassioned, jubilant, enigmatic years.’ What Foucault observed around 1968 obviously differed from what Malinowski had faced exactly half a century before, but as far as the sense of irrevocable change is concerned, they faced a similarly pressing climate of intellectual revaluations. And not unlike Malinowski, Foucault skillfully harnessed some of the key energies unleashed by his <italic>Zeitgeist</italic>. Interestingly, roughly at the same biographical time that Malinowski celebrated the success of his <italic>Argonauts</italic> and received the new chair at LSE, Foucault published his famous <italic>Archaeology of Knowledge</italic> and received a nomination to join the prestigious Collège de France. By the time he was 50, he occupied a conspicuous and respected, even if controversial, intellectual position. In liberal circles he came to be perceived as someone who provided then ‘the most powerful, plausible and honest option available’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368431011423577">Dreyfus and Rabinow, 1983</xref>: 124–5). How are we to make sense of the emergence and staying power of this tremendous reputation?</p>
<p>At the level of symbolic (dis)association Foucault appears to be a paradigmatic stage-setter who cares a lot for the belonging value and contrast value. ‘Foucault was at every moment of his career highly attuned both to the prevailing intellectual mood and to the needs and expectations of his audience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368431011423577">Paras, 2006</xref>: 153). How exactly did he use his alertness? More than any specific cultural or ideological allegiance, which he seems to have regarded skeptically early on, it was the ‘polluting’ of and dramatized opposition to academic icons of his time that were his weapon of choice. His polemical pursuit was a negative response to the dominance of existentialism and the broad dissatisfaction with ‘old academism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1368431011423577">Whitebook, 2003</xref>: 314). Interestingly enough, he launched his intellectual onslaughts not from philosophical but theoretical literary positions. Blanchot’s vision of language as an ‘enveloping totality’ that transcends individual subjectivity profoundly impressed him. The result of this early fascination was the publication of <italic>The Order of Things</italic> in 1966, a book that Eric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368431011423577">Paras (2006</xref>: 8) described as a ‘deliberate provocation’. Foucault’s arguments were inscribed skillfully within a broader scheme of the new powerful vogue of structuralism. The responses to this book by such existentialists as Sartre predictably yanked Foucault out of obscurity. Explicit rejection by an established intellectual icon is a special form of recognition. The participation in highly publicized debates with such icon occasioned his ascendance to fame. It firmly established the high contrast value of his position.</p>
<p>That was, however, certainly not sufficient. He needed a positive argument as well, and therefore paid attention to intellectual (dis)ambiguation. The field value of his lifework, again not unlike Malinowski’s, was predicated on the trope of abnormality and taboo: crime, delinquency, illness, sexuality. Among his unusual topics were: marginalization of mentally ill, strategies of confinement of delinquents, stigmatization of atypical sexual practices, etc. Each was a subject of his emancipatory discourse. These thematic qualities helped carve out an unconventional humanistic niche dramatized by his idiosyncratic style that was sacramental and blunt, at once vivid and opaque. There was both a certain shock value and mystery value to his intricate histories. ‘Being confronted with Foucault’s production meant being confronted with a special style of writing and unusual questions’ (Bove, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368431011423577">Deleuze, 1988</xref>: xxxvi). It also meant ‘being confronted with a strong dose of ambiguity linked to the language based on the rhetorical trope of catachresis, i.e. deliberate misuse of certain categories and subversion of established semantic distinctions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1368431011423577">White, 1987</xref>: 115).</p>
<p>Moreover, Foucault juggled with conventions and used various historical illustrations to evocatively diagnose the present. He did not want to be perceived just as a philosopher or as a gatherer of curious social facts, and he certainly did not really concern himself with the standard problems of history. He was rather a cultural thinker whose job was to treat his empirical material as ‘surface effects’ of deeper dynamics of culture. He was not after solving the puzzles of normal social science but criticizing and revising major categories of understanding. This proclivity for implying a broader relevance of specific histories is bewilderingly similar to Malinowski’s attitude. This similarity can hardly be understood as an accident. Instead, it reveals a more basic characteristic of the iconic intellectual pursuits. Even if he denied its ontological stability, Foucault dealt with what he saw to be profound problems of ‘human nature’, not historical curiosities studied for their own sake.</p>
<p>But Foucault would not have become an iconic thinker had he not managed to establish particular emblematic values. He became the author of no less than three different epistemic brands: archaeology, genealogy, and subjectivity. His ‘archaeology’ was about describing conceptual structures and framing new questions of social ideas and anonymous systematicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368431011423577">Paras, 2006</xref>: 154). His ‘genealogy’ was about ‘casual antecedents of a socio-intellectual reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368431011423577">Gutting, 2003</xref>: 12). His emblematic ‘power/knowledge’ notion emerged out of this pursuit. Finally, his late notion of ‘subjectivity’ was about the ‘techniques of the self’ and conditions of individual liberty, ethical cultivation, and pleasure. All three concepts were forms of semiotic condensation, in that they focused a whole series of humanistic problems that occurred at the intersection of modern history and philosophy. Moreover, these problems were refracted by such master binaries as subject/object, freedom/coercion, contingency/necessity, freedom/determination, reason/madness and discipline/transgression. Foucault focused on ‘shifting normative articulation of the boundary between reason and unreason, between valid and invalid experience, between normal and abnormal behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368431011423577">Faubion, 1998</xref>: xiii). Wide audiences were attracted to his conviction that thinking must always transcend the boundaries of what is considered ‘normal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39a-1368431011423577">Lemert and Gillan, 1999</xref>: 26).</p>
<p>A good example of his verbal image that served exactly this purpose of disturbing the normal was his theorization whereby the ‘birth’ of certain modern institutions was accompanied by the ‘death’ of the subject. It reveals Foucault’s fascination with the Nietzschean sublime style (think about the death of God), and at the same time with the Lévi-Straussian combination of structural imagination and novelistic flow (think about <italic>Tristes</italic> <italic>Tropiques</italic>). Interestingly, Foucault never freed himself from Nietzsche’s influence. In his last interview he said: ‘I am simply a Nietzschean and try as far as possible to see with the help of Nietzsche’s texts … I attempt nothing else’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1368431011423577">Sluga, 2003</xref>: 210). At the same time, ‘Foucault’s discourse always tends toward the oracular and intimations of apocalypse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1368431011423577">White, 1987</xref>: 107). This paradoxical profile, underscored by the thematic and idiosyncratic qualities of his works, was part of his ascetic self-ascription of charisma.</p>
<p>However, the charisma attributed to Foucault stemmed not only from the aforementioned assets. It assumed its formidable international proportions only after 1968 when a kind of cultural anomie experienced at that social threshold created a symbolic space for independent intellectual pursuits at once profound, progressive and free from ideological denials and theoretical distortions, exemplified by Althusser whose ‘star was then on the wane’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368431011423577">Judt, 2008</xref>: 110). Foucault emerged from the heady years of the 1960s as a powerful intellectual persona culturally ‘qualified’ to take this space, just as Malinowski had become culturally ‘eligible’ to act as the Conrad of anthropology transcending the British doyens of his profession. His statements promised truly progressive shifts in the established distribution of the sacred and profane because he moved critical emphasis from mind and ideology to body and sexuality, showing that the latter were as important to understanding of politics as the former. Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1368431011423577">Shusterman (2000</xref>: 270) describes this perfectly when he writes, ‘Foucault’s seminal vision of the body as a docile, malleable site for inscribing social power reveals the crucial role somatics can play for political philosophy.’ Importantly, this message has been ‘fruitfully embraced by feminist and queer body theorists’ (Shusterman, 2000: 270).</p>
<p>In other words, Foucault refreshed the political by incorporation and reconceptualization of another hot topic of the era – the sexual. Moreover, he went further than others by radically pluralizing the notion of the sexual. This was in line with his theoretical structuralist agenda that aimed to pluralize epistemology. These preoccupations made him interested in the ‘<italic>counter-sciences</italic> of psychoanalysis, ethnology, and linguistics’ which he saw as vehicles of ‘the dissolution of Man and the turn to the dark being of Language that provided the ground for the transgressions of the poets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1368431011423577">Riley, 2005</xref>: 291). His archaeologies and genealogies were designed to flesh out this turn and as such they rendered him ‘perhaps the most important of the thinkers in pursuit of the impure sacred’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1368431011423577">Riley, 2005</xref>: 290). This was the ‘left sacred’ that the transformative spirit of the 1960s inspired and deserved at the ideational level. While Foucault may have distanced himself from the traditional communist concerns, he saw himself as speaking on behalf of all subaltern subjects, as someone who not only exposes hidden determinations but suggests how to resist them. Without it he might have ended up being just another eloquent French critic. His tellingly titled books published in the 1970s, e.g. <italic>Society Must Be Defended</italic>, reflect his social engagement. Books from that period captured the 1960s-inspired <italic>Zeitgeist</italic> and thus had the potential of becoming the quintessential, generational statement. Moreover, as a kind of neo-conservative counter-reformation swelled towards the end of the 1970s and took off politically in the 1980s, Foucault’s lifework assumed the meaning of a key ‘left’ intellectual resource.</p>
<p>This now more sociological character of Foucault’s writing came at the right time also as far as the changing role of public intellectual was concerned. An observation by Jean Daniel, founder and editor of the French <italic>Nouvel Observateur,</italic> is a case in point: from the 1960s on, ‘it was among the human sciences that one had to look for the equivalent of the <italic>litterateurs</italic>’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368431011423577">Judt, 2008</xref>: 97). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368431011423577">Judt (2008</xref>: 97) remarks, ‘in the world of Barthes, Lévi-Strauss and Foucault, Camus was <italic>depassé.</italic>’ It is hard to judge whether Camus’ untimely death in 1960, the same year when <italic>Tel Quel</italic> took off, had anything to do with that. Likewise, it is impossible to know for sure if Foucault was fully aware of this shift and acted accordingly. But the apparent correspondence between what and when he actually produced and the emerging trend counts as a significant condition of his success.</p>
<p>So equipped, stylized and positioned, Foucault had a chance to be more than a gatekeeper; he could and did assume intellectual authority of a high order. Paradoxically, it was not only the admiration of his progressive audiences but also an avalanche of very critical, professional responses that seems to have confirmed his significance. The attacks by high profile fellow intellectuals were manifold and from all sides. It is precisely the fact that Foucault managed to survive such intellectual onslaughts that invites one to ask about the mechanism of his enduring stature and influence. Let us briefly recount the key criticisms.</p>
<p>Allan Megill wrote in his book <italic>Prophets of Extremity</italic>: ‘Foucault’s approach was so “unmethodological” that his only apparently methodological text, <italic>The Archaeology of Knowledge</italic>, was really a spoof’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368431011423577">Kendall and Wickham, 1999</xref>: vii). Charles Taylor criticized Foucault’s famous concept of power as an unacceptable oversimplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368431011423577">Gutting, 2003</xref>: 19) and George <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1368431011423577">Rousseau (1999</xref>: 20) noted sarcastically that Foucault was in one sense the most defective of historians because he possessed a post-Nietzschean philosophy of history without actual history. Foucault was also accused of ‘false constructivism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368431011423577">Hamilton, 1996</xref>) and attacked by Habermas for his ambivalence towards humanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368431011423577">Ingram, 2003</xref>: 241). Luc Ferry and Alain Renaut, leaders of the French neoliberal movement, portrayed Foucault as perniciously ‘consistent anti-humanist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368431011423577">Paras, 2006</xref>: 151). Others pointed out that though the late Foucault’s ‘newfound existential perspective rescues us from the prison of the docile body’, it nonetheless ‘does little to confront a wider vision of societal rationalization peppered with stoic, individual islands of aesthetic resistance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1368431011423577">Smith, 2008</xref>: 182). A biography by James Miller depicted Foucault as a cynical hedonist and denounced his work on this ground.</p>
<p>One of the strongest criticisms emerged on empirical grounds and was connected to the famous story of the <italic>Narrenschiff</italic>, the German term for the ship of fools. Foucault employed it carelessly and boldly linked what he emblematically called the Great Confinement of the mentally ill to the ascendancy of rationalism in Europe. He accounted neither for the ambiguity of the original term (the word could mean either ‘fool’ or ‘jester’) nor for the problematic status of his source (he used just one book which was a collection of literary stories by Sebastian Brant published in 1494). He saw <italic>Narrenschiff</italic> as a river-floating prison for madmen and a stable social institution. This representation of the issue was gripping enough to influence intellectuals for years. Although it was disproved by 1982 by German psychologists and historians (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368431011423577">Comer, 2001</xref>: 5), Foucault’s reputation as a thinker was not shattered, just as Malinowski’s stature survived numerous fierce scientific refutations.</p>
<p>Foucault may have been a ‘historian without insides’ as a common criticism goes, but not without insights, and that was crucial for many audiences who supported his broader emancipatory pursuit. His flaws as an historian did not eclipse the positive thrust of his interventions, for he ‘enhanced our understanding of the operation of social power – in part owing to the element of rhetorical overstatement at which he excelled’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1368431011423577">Wolin, 1998</xref>: 722). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1368431011423577">John Neubauer’s (1999</xref>: ix) take is similarly generous:<disp-quote>
<p>Not unlike Nietzsche, his adopted predecessor, he has been severely scrutinized by scholars of the disciplines in which he worked, yet the real significance of his personality and work transcends disciplinary boundaries and it transcends even the question whether in specific instances he was right or wrong. Like Nietzsche, he will probably be remembered as a great gadfly that questioned central assumptions in Western culture.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Foucault assumed iconicity because of questions he asked, not answers he delivered.</p>
<p>In this respect the intellectual meaning of Foucault’s lifework is similar to the one ascribed to Malinowski’s. It consists not necessarily in the classical truth factor but in the doubt factor. Foucault subordinated historical facts to ‘higher’ theoretical goals of social significance: ‘Recourse to history is meaningful to the extent that history serves to show, how that which is, has not always been’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423577">Foucault, 1998</xref>: 450). Malinowski thought the same when he wrote: ‘It is only what can be squeezed out of facts in the way of generalizations that really matters; history explains nothing’ (letter, 21 June 1918).</p>
<p>Moreover, Foucault was able to mutate his voice and to come up with ever changing emblem values. This ‘centerlessness of his thought’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368431011423577">Paras, 2006</xref>: 153) lent itself to various interpretations and thus attracted interdisciplinary audiences. ‘Foucault’s multiple receptions reflect the <italic>Vielschichtigkeit</italic> of his œuvre, a <italic>Vielschichtigkeit</italic> which will probably ensure its survival long after his name has ceased to be used as a fashionable shibboleth in cultural analysis and history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368431011423577">Maclean, 1999</xref>: 176). Even shortly before his death Foucault’s intellectual trajectory veered in yet another direction. After years of research revolving around the motif of the other symbolized by the socially marginal and the abnormal, whose outcomes Sartre called ‘pseudo-histories’ and Baudrillard wished to ‘forget’, Foucault turned towards studies of individual freedom and ‘care for the self’. With his ‘hermeneutics of the subject’ he closed the contentious circle of his intellectual pursuit: from the analysis of cultural patterns of the pathological and ‘the death of the subject’ to the analysis of cultural patterns of personal wellness and resurrection of individual.</p>
<p>Although surprising in topical and theoretical substance, this closure saw Foucault committed to the same general ideal of human liberation. Perhaps more than ever before, towards the end of his life Foucault explored various forms of impure sacred such as ‘very intense pleasures’ related to drug use, and argued that they ‘must become a part of our culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1368431011423577">Shusterman, 2000</xref>: 281). This was precisely the agenda that has been developed by the cult post-1960s American counter-cultural intellectuals such as Terrence McKenna and later Daniel Pinchbeck. Foucault’s lifework would always be a key background representation for this milieu, an archetype of radical and off-beat but serious public thinker attuned to the cutting edge phenomena of his or her time. As Alexander <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1368431011423577">Riley (2005</xref>: 296) observes, this kind of effort to concentrate on the impure sacred means ‘a rejection of the split between intellectuals and masses … an effort to formulate a more holistic theory of the sacred not limited by the hyper-rationalized perspective of the optimistic positivist intellectual’. Foucault’s iconicity stemmed partly from this engagement with and reconfiguration of the impure sacred.</p>
<p>This whole trajectory was compelling, so variegated that it indeed could be re-narrated for various intellectual purposes. Like a truly iconic representation, it was culturally portable: quotable, transposable, instantly recognizable. Interestingly, in his last works, Foucault explicitly reached out to the ancient symbolic resource of Socratic wisdom. And it is not an exaggeration to say that, like a Socratic figure, he attempted to renounce his ‘prophetic’ stature any time it was hinted at. By distancing himself from the attribution of prophetic quality and describing himself rather as ‘parrhesiast’, not a rhetor, he paradoxically only confirmed his ‘messianic’ role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1368431011423577">Smith, 2008</xref>). The overt acts of disowning fame made him more ascetic and authentic in the eyes of his audiences and helped him transfix them all the more effectively.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Foucault’s intellectual pursuit was iconized because it idiosyncratically and unflinchingly espoused the vision which many educated audiences of his time needed and wanted to believe in. A particular charismatic image of the intellectual iconoclast that used to be attributed to him mostly by the young progressive circles was so attractive that their members simply did not wish to notice inconvenient interpretations or accept certain potentially disturbing facts of Foucault’s lifework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1368431011423577">Rousseau, 1999</xref>: 28). The readers deeply sympathetic to Foucault not only analyzed him, they believed him. Therefore, although some of Foucault’s ambitious interventions turned out to be ‘heroic failures rather than constructive victories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368431011423577">Maclean, 1999</xref>: 164), they made audiences alert and generous. Because his works inspired not only a sense of intellectual urgency but also aesthetic delight, they at once challenged and pleased, teased and soothed. Foucault was aware of this performative asset. To him, an intellectual work consisted of ‘introducing a significant difference in the field of knowledge, at the cost of a certain difficulty for the author and the reader, with, however, the eventual recompense of a certain pleasure, that is to say of access to another figure of truth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423577">Foucault, 1998</xref>: ix). The dialectics of the beautiful and the sublime in this passage reflects Foucault’s performative awareness, a clear understanding that without blending the elements of <italic>docere</italic> and <italic>delectare</italic>, few intellectual pursuits become truly important. Foucault may have been one of those who eclipsed literary authors, but, like Malinowski, he deemed the certain literary quality of his work indispensable for its proper reception.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The stories of Malinowski and Foucault indicate that iconic status stems from culturally mediated performances of authors and audiences no less than from institutional and material circumstances. I argued that turbulences of liminal time, be it social upheaval, cultural crisis or scientific paradigm shift, are conducive to the creation of <italic>cultural space</italic> without which iconicity of intellectual pursuits are unlikely. That is to say, in the absence of this space, even the most ambitious pursuits can hardly attain meaningfulness of iconic collective representation. It is hard to comprehend how the iconic intellectual pursuits resonate in people’s minds unless we understand the specific creative personality of the theorist in relation to the broader symbolic conditions she or he grapples with. To grasp this aspect firmly, we need a performative, cultural sensibility. Intellectual signifiers are neither inherently iconic nor institutionally determined. They emerge as icons within a specific constellation of relevant dialogues in the climate of particular ideational, emotional and normative expectations. The present theory systematizes this insight and the case studies provide basic evidence for it.</p>
<p>Although Malinowski and Foucault represent different times and levels of iconicity, they resemble each other as cultural archetypes of <italic>icon/oclastic</italic> yet serious thinkers whose lifework makes intellectual and cultural transformations likely. Can we say that they were less subjects than objects of their creative strategies? One of the goals of this study is to show that the answer to this question is negative or at least ambivalent. To return to Lamont’s seminal article’s title, one cannot formulate a precise recipe of how to become an iconic social thinker. That is one of the morals of the present story. However, with the cultural perspective fleshed out here, one can systematize the benefit of hindsight and indicate how iconic intellectuals attained their extraordinary clout. The trick is to avoid overly deterministic as well as overly idiographic approaches, each of which tends to underscore either causality or contingency in their flagship cases. Iconic intellectual success is always contingently enacted. But it is also a reenactment of the immemorial cultural myth of the critical mind in search of radically new cognitive and social horizons. Iconic thinkers are highly self-conscious about their role as such.</p>
<p>More examples can and should be studied to advance this framework. More empirical work is needed to sharpen the basic tools put to work here. Yet their explanatory promise seems considerable, especially when extended to contemporary theorists like Edward Said. As was the case of Malinowski and Foucault, as well as Marx and Freud, his flagship works were subject to empirical castigation and yet his reputation only grew. When he died in 2003, ‘he was probably the best-known intellectual in the world … the idolized hero of a generation from Berkeley to Bombay’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368431011423577">Judt, 2008</xref>: 163–4). No wonder, given that he has worked out his own emblem value (Orientalism), picked and ‘polluted’ a key figure of an established discipline to do it (Bernard Lewis), and subsequently spawned a sub-discipline in its own right (post-colonial studies) at the time when de-colonization was one of the hottest international political topics and meant huge social transitions (liminal time). He explicitly referred to a poignant and controversial case of an other (the Palestinian), whose lot he presented as paradigmatically subaltern, one that he, an intellectual, had an obligation to give voice to, and generalize for the broad purpose of human liberation. At the same time, he was an accomplished aesthete, a Conrad scholar, an eloquent writer, perceived by many as a cultivated cosmopolitan wedded more to his intellect than any specific allegiance, ‘singularly important’ and ‘irreplaceable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368431011423577">Judt, 2008</xref>: 176). But in academic life even the atypical and eccentric is a kind of type. An iconic intellectual embodies and renews the archetype of idiosyncratic but symbolically structured dissent without which discourses and with them whole cultures stagnate, becoming, at best, boring, at worst, authoritarian.</p>
