<title>Background:</title>
<p>Our study evaluated the short-term clinical and radiographic results of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) with combined bony reconstructions for treatment of end-stage ankle osteoarthritis with accompanying cavovarus/hindfoot varus deformities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712460183">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>This study included 8 patients (10 ankles) with ankle osteoarthritis (OA) who were treated by TAA with combined calcaneal and metatarsal osteotomies between September 2004 and June 2010 and were followed an average of 17.9 months (12-43 months). Visual analogue scale (VAS) score, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, radiographic measurements, and patient satisfaction were evaluated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712460183">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The average patient age was 66.2 years (range, 55-76 years). Eighteen bony reconstruction procedures such as lateral sliding calcaneal osteotomy (n = 9) and first metatarsal dorsiflexion osteotomy (n = 4) were performed in addition to TAA. VAS pain score improved from an average of 8.8 (range, 6-10) preoperatively to an average of 2.4 (range, 0-7) (<italic>P &lt;</italic> .05), and the AOFAS score improved from 36.9 (range, 14-71) preoperatively to 89.3 (range, 68-100) (<italic>P &lt;</italic> .05). Ninety percent of the patients were satisfied with the results. Radiographically, the tibiocalcaneal angle (TCA) improved from a preoperative average of 19.0 degrees (range, 13-23 degrees) to 0.2 degrees (range, –5.4 to 2.8 degrees), the tibial axis–talar dome angle (TA-TDA) improved from a preoperative average of 15.6 degrees (range, 11.1-18.0 degrees) to 3.3 degrees (range, 1.7-5.6 degrees), and the talar dome–ground surface angle (TD-GSA) improved from a preoperative average of 21.2 degrees (range, 15.4-27.5 degrees) to 5.1 degrees (range, 1.8-10.2 degrees) (<italic>P &lt;</italic> .05).</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>We found that it was occasionally necessary to perform combined calcaneal and metatarsal osteotomies with TAA in order to successfully treat ankle OA with an accompanying cavovarus/varus deformity.

<body>
<p>End-stage ankle osteoarthritis (OA) with an accompanying cavovarus or hindfoot varus deformity is relatively common, with a variable incidence of 9% to 55%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460183">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460183">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712460183">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460183">17</xref></sup> To successfully treat this disease entity with total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), the accompanying deformity has to be corrected adequately to restore neutral coronal plane alignment and congruent articulation of the ankle joint. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460183">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460183">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460183">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460183">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460183">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460183">14</xref></sup> Deformity correction in the coronal plane must be judiciously considered while performing TAA since residual angular deformity or malalignment after the operation can result in instability, progressive edge-loading, or subluxation of the bearing, leading eventually to arthroplasty failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460183">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460183">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460183">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460183">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460183">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460183">18</xref></sup> Thus, considering previously reported poor clinical outcomes and higher revision rates of TAA performed for ankle OA with an accompanying deformity, many authors have even suggested excluding moderate to severe varus ankle OA from the indications for TAA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460183">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460183"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460183">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460183">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460183">12,13</xref></sup> There has been controversy regarding the degree of accompanying varus deformity allowable for TAA. Wood et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460183">16</xref></sup> suggested that the indications for TAA should be narrowed to ankle OA with less than 15 degrees of varus or valgus deformity, whereas others have suggested that the absolute contraindication for TAA should be narrowed to ankle OA with greater than 20 degrees of varus deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460183">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460183">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460183">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460183">16</xref></sup> Various additional procedures to be performed before or with TAA have been suggested to correct the accompanying deformities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460183">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460183">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460183">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460183">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460183">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460183">18</xref></sup> However, a few reports describe the outcome of TAA with combined additional bony reconstructions for treatment of ankle OA with accompanying cavovarus or hindfoot varus deformities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term clinical and radiographic results of TAA with combined bony reconstructions for treatment of end-stage ankle OA with accompanying cavovarus/hindfoot varus deformities.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712460183" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study included 8 patients (10 ankles) having end-stage ankle OA with an accompanying cavovarus or hindfoot varus deformity who underwent TAA with combined bony reconstructions between September 2004 and June 2010 and were followed up for at least 12 months. During the same period, TAA was performed in a total of 31 ankles at the same institution by a single surgeon (H.G.J.). Exclusion criteria for TAA were as follows: neuropathic arthropathy or infectious arthritis of the affected ankle and avascular necrosis (AVN) of the talus affecting more than 50%. This study was approved by our institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from the patients. The study population consisted of 2 males and 6 females and included 4 right ankles and 6 left ankles. The average patient age was 66.2 years (range, 55-76 years) and the average follow-up period was 17.9 months (range, 12-43 months). The average patient weight was 65.0 kg (range, 43.5-77 kg), and the average body mass index was 27.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 21.1-31.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). A marked cavovarus deformity and a hindfoot varus deformity were present in 8 ankles and 2 ankles, respectively. Among the 10 ankles, a significant history of ankle trauma was noted in 4 ankles (4 patients), which probably contributed to the development of ankle OA. Six ankles were replaced with Mobility total ankle prosthesis (DePuy, Leeds, United Kingdom), whereas 4 ankles were replaced with HINTEGRA total ankle prosthesis (Newdeal, Lyons, France). In the early part of the study period, HINTEGRA total ankle prosthesis had been routinely used, whereas in the latter period, we used Mobility total ankle prosthesis.</p>
<sec id="section7-1071100712460183">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The bony reconstructive surgical procedures in addition to TAA for the accompanying cavovarus or hindfoot varus deformity were planned before the surgery after the patients were evaluated through physical examination including the Coleman block test and the necessary radiographs including hindfoot alignment radiographic views.</p>
<p>Under spinal or general anesthesia, a thigh tourniquet was applied. With the patient lying in supine position, total ankle arthroplasty was performed using a standard anterior midline approach. Distal tibial cutting was performed in the plane estimated to be at 90 degrees to the lower extremity mechanical axis and parallel to the ground surface. In case of deep erosion of the medial tibial plafond, a thicker portion of the lateral tibial compartment was resected. For the talus positioned in varus with a contracted medial deltoid ligament, deltoid ligament release was performed by releasing the inner attachments of the deep deltoid ligament on the tibia or the talar side in order to realign the varus-tilted talus parallel to the tibial plafond. We performed deltoid ligament release on the talar side first, because we could predict the degree of deltoid ligament release better by releasing on the talar side compared with the tibial side. After appropriate tibial plafond and talar dome resections were performed, tibial and talar implants and the polyethylene spacer were inserted according to the specific ankle prosthesis used (Mobility or HINTEGRA total ankle prosthesis). The final decision to perform additional bony reconstructive procedures was made intraoperatively after TAA was completed and the presence of residual hindfoot varus deformities was confirmed.</p>
<p>To correct the hindfoot varus deformity, lateral sliding calcaneal osteotomy (LSCO) was performed by creating an oblique osteotomy of the calcaneus and translating the calcaneus by 5 to 10 mm before fixation with one or two 6.5- or 7.0-mm cannulated screws. For the combined forefoot cavus deformity with first ray plantar flexion, either first metatarsal dorsiflexion osteotomy (1MTDFO) or first tarsometatarsal dorsiflexion arthrodesis (1TMTDFA) was performed concomitantly. All the cavovarus patients had rigid hindfoot varus, which required 1MTDFO/1TMTDFA as well as LSCO.</p>
<p>First metatarsal dorsiflexion osteotomy (1MTDFO) was performed by creating an oblique osteotomy of the proximal metatarsal about 2 cm distal to the tarsometatarsal joint, from distal dorsal to proximal plantar, with the removal of a 2-mm-thick dorsal wedge and fixation with a 2.7- or 3.5-mm screw. For the cases that required a greater degree of correction of the cavus deformity, 1TMTDFA was performed by removal of a 3-mm-thick dorsal wedge from the first tarsometatarsal joint and fixation with two 2.7-mm crossed headless screws.</p>
<p>In case of residual lateral ankle instability, a peroneus longus to peroneus brevis transfer or Brostrom procedure was performed. After TAA and additional surgical procedures were performed, maximum ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) was measured with the knee in flexion; in case of less than 10 degrees of dorsiflexion, Achilles tendon lengthening was performed by percutaneous triple hemisection. Postoperatively, a short leg splint with compressive dressing was applied initially before changing to a short leg cast, which was applied for 8 weeks. Non–weight bearing was instructed for 6 weeks postoperatively, partial weight bearing for 6 to 10 weeks postoperatively, and full weight bearing after 10 weeks postoperatively. Normal activity was then recommended after 12 weeks postoperatively. Physical therapy including modalities and ROM exercise was prescribed immediately after cast removal at 8 weeks postoperatively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1071100712460183">
<title>Clinical Evaluation</title>
<p>All the patients were evaluated before the operation and in the clinic postoperatively after 2 and 6 weeks, after 3 and 6 months, and at 1 year. Clinical evaluation included administration of a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, assessment by the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle–hindfoot functional score, and measurement of the ankle ROM. The ROM of the ankle–hindfoot complex was measured manually by a goniometer for ankle plantar flexion (PF) and dorsiflexion (DF). In addition, the patients were asked whether they were satisfied (1 = very satisfied, 2 = satisfied, 3 = fairly satisfied, 4 = dissatisfied) with the surgical outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1071100712460183">
<title>Radiographic Evaluation</title>
<p>Standard weight-bearing ankle and foot anteroposterior (AP)/lateral radiographs and the hindfoot alignment view were taken before the operation; serially at postoperative 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months; yearly; and at the most recent follow-up. The serial radiographs of the patients were evaluated by 2 authors, an orthopedic resident (J.S.H.) and an orthopedic foot and ankle fellow (K.T.H.). Varus ankle deformity was defined when the tibiocalcaneal angle (TCA, the angle between the tibial axis and calcaneal axis on the hindfoot alignment view) was greater than 10 degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712460183">Figure 1A</xref>) or the tibial axis–talar dome angle (TA-TDA, the angle between the anatomical axis of the tibia and a line drawn perpendicular to the talar dome) was greater than 10 degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712460183">Figure 1B</xref>). Another important radiographic parameter that was measured was the talar dome–ground surface angle (TD-GSA, the angle between the talar dome and the ground surface on standing AP view of the ankle) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712460183">Figure 2A</xref>). Talar tilt angle (TTA, the angle between the tibial plafond and the talar dome on standing AP view) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712460183">Figure 2B</xref>), tibial shaft to tibial joint angle on AP view (TAS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712460183">Figure 2C</xref>), and tibial shaft to tibial joint line angle on lateral view (TLS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712460183">Figure 2D</xref>) were also measured for evaluation of the deformity. Loosening of the tibial or talar implants was evaluated according to published radiological criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460183">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460183">10</xref>,19</sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All 8 patients in the current study had a cavovarus foot or hindfoot varus deformity with incongruent varus ankles and a significant TTA. To correct a hindfoot varus in ankle OA (10 feet), lateral sliding calcaneal osteotomy was performed in 9 feet and lateral closing-wedge calcaneal osteotomy was performed in 1 foot, whereas first metatarsal dorsiflexion osteotomy (4 feet) and first tarsometatarsal dorsiflexion arthrodesis (4 feet) were performed in 8 feet to correct an accompanying midfoot/forefoot cavus deformity. Therefore, a total of 18 calcaneal or metatarsal osteotomies (ie, 10 LSCO, 4 1MTDFO, 4 1TMTDFA) were performed for 10 feet in addition to TAA. Since all the varus deformities (10 feet) were fixed (ie, Coleman block test negative), LSCO was added to 1MTDFO/1TMTDFA in all cavovarus feet. A peroneus longus to peroneus brevis transfer (3 feet) and Brostrom procedure (1 foot) were performed additionally to treat associated chronic lateral ankle instability. Achilles tendon lengthening by percutaneous triple hemisection was performed in 3 ankles that showed less than 10 degrees of ankle dorsiflexion after TAA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712460183">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Clinical Outcome</title>
<p>The mean preoperative and postoperative AOFAS ankle scores were 36.9 (range, 14-71) and 89.3 (range, 68-100), respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The mean preoperative and postoperative VAS for pain were 8.8 (range, 6-10) and 2.4 (range, 0-7), respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The mean ankle ROM increased from 44.0 degrees (average DF/PF 10.5 degrees/33.5 degrees) preoperatively to 54.1 degrees (average DF/PF 12.4 degrees/41.7 degrees) at the final follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>Among a total of 8 patients, 4 patients (5 ankles) were very satisfied, 4 patients (4 ankles) were satisfied, and 1 patient was dissatisfied. The dissatisfied patient became infected and was salvaged with a bone block ankle arthrodesis.</p>
<p>Regarding the postoperative complications, there were 2 cases of superficial peroneal nerve neuralgia and 1 case of medial ankle impingement. Both cases of superficial peroneal nerve neuralgia partially resolved at final follow-up. One patient complained of chronic ankle pain without any other signs of infection for 6 months postoperatively, which was diagnosed by exploration as chronic low-grade infection of the ankle with resultant tibiotalar osteomyelitis; this case was finally salvaged with ankle arthrodesis using an interpositional femoral head allograft.</p>

<title>Radiological Outcome</title>
<p>There was a statistically significant difference in the correction of varus deformity in the coronal plane on both standing AP and hindfoot alignment views. The TCA improved from a preoperative average of 19.0 degrees (range, 13-23 degrees) to 0.2 degrees (range, –5.4 to 2.8 degrees) and the TA-TDA angle improved from a preoperative average of 15.6 degrees (range, 11.1-18.0 degrees) to 3.3 degrees (range, 1.7-5.6 degrees), whereas the TD-GSA improved from a preoperative average of 21.2 degrees (range, 15.4-27.5 degrees) to 5.1 degrees (range, 1.8-10.2 degrees); all these differences were statistically significant (<italic>P &lt;</italic> .05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100712460183">Figure 3</xref>). The TTA improved from a preoperative average of 9.3 degrees (range, 6.4-11.3 degrees) to 3.1 degrees (range, 1.2-5.3 degrees) (<italic>P &lt;</italic> .05). The TAS increased from a preoperative average of 83.8 degrees (range, 81.8-87.0 degrees) to 88.3 degrees (range, 85.4-89.5 degrees) (<italic>P &lt;</italic> .05), and TLS increased from a preoperative average of 80.3 degrees (range, 72.0-82.6 degrees) to 85.2 degrees (range, 81.2-87.9 degrees) (<italic>P &lt;</italic> .05). Radiographically, there were no cases of tibial or talar implant loosening or migration and no cases of dislocation of the polyethylene insert.</p>

<p>End-stage ankle OA with an accompanying varus deformity was initially excluded from the indications for TAA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460183">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460183">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460183">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460183">9</xref></sup> However, with the improvement of surgical techniques and instruments as well as with an increase in the clinical experience of TAA, the spectrum of indications for TAA for treatment of ankle OA with an accompanying varus deformity has increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460183">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460183">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460183">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460183">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460183">10</xref></sup> Although there have been increased indications for TAA for treating ankle OA with an accompanying varus deformity, there are only a few reports about varus ankle OA treated with TAA and concomitant bony reconstruction for the accompanying cavovarus or varus deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460183">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460183">10</xref></sup> It has been emphasized that the accompanying hindfoot varus deformity has to be corrected adequately to restore neutral coronal plane ankle alignment and a congruent tibiotalar articulation, which will prevent progressive asymmetric edge-loading and subluxation or dislocation of the ultra–high molecular weight polyethylene insert that will eventually lead to severe TAA failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460183">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460183"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460183">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460183">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460183">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460183">13</xref></sup> To successfully reconstruct the accompanying varus ankle or hindfoot deformity in TAA, deltoid ligament balancing or asymmetric tibiotalar cutting was often found to be inadequate, especially to obtain the talar dome surface parallel to the ground surface, which we believe is essential for the long-term success of TAA.</p>
<p>All the patients in the current study had a cavovarus foot or hindfoot varus deformity with incongruent varus ankles, which meant that the cause of the varus-tilted ankle was present in the region below the ankle level, and this deformity had to be addressed in order to realign the tilted talar dome. Bony reconstruction procedures, mainly lateral sliding calcaneal osteotomy and first metatarsal closing-wedge dorsiflexion osteotomy or first tarsometatarsal dorsiflexion arthrodesis, were necessary in addition to TAA. TAA had been performed initially and, through deltoid ligament release and some asymmetric cutting of the distal tibia, some hindfoot varus correction had been achieved. However, to achieve satisfactory neutral coronal plane realignment, bony reconstructions were required. In the current study, there were no cases of polyethylene insert dislocation or fracture, thereby implying good coronal plane alignment.</p>
<p>With respect to radiographic evaluation of the coronal plane alignment, TD-GSA was found to be a very important radiographic parameter. For diagnosing ankle OA with an accompanying hindfoot varus deformity as well as for evaluating the degree of varus deformity correction, the TCA and TA-TDA were the other important radiographic parameters. Among the radiographic measurements described and measured, the TCA showed the greatest degree of angular correction postoperatively. In contrast, the TAS and TLS angles were relatively less important radiographic parameters. For correcting forefoot cavus deformity, 1TMTDFA was found to be a more powerful correction technique than 1MTDFO, and therefore 1TMTDFA was performed to achieve a greater degree of forefoot/midfoot cavus correction.</p>
<p>Although the data were obtained from a small number of patients, the clinical outcome of TAA in the current study was quite favorable compared with other studies of TAA for the treatment of ankle OA. However, limited data and short-term follow-up remain the weaknesses of the current preliminary study and should be the target for future improvements. Additionally, the different total ankles and various procedures used are confounding factors are important shortcomings of the study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>End-stage ankle OA with an accompanying marked cavovarus/varus deformity should be treated by TAA with a concomitant corrective calcaneal and metatarsal osteotomies in order to realign the coronal plane deformity and achieve a successful outcome. TD-GSA and TCA were found to be important radiographic parameters for the coronal plane ankle alignment in patients with end-stage ankle OA with accompanying cavovarus/hindfoot varus deformities.</p>
