<abstract>
<p>The National Survey of Disaster Experiences and Preparedness (NSDEP) examined whether households in the United States have engaged in proactive preparedness and avoidance activities since September 11, 2001, and whether the activities reported were done because of terrorism, natural disasters, other reasons, or any combination of reasons. Reported activities were examined by geographic area of exposure to or threat of 9/11, gender, race/ethnic identification, and income. The sample was drawn using random-digit-dialing (RDD) supplemented with surname lists. Data were collected between April 13, 2007, and February 13, 2008. Few households did preparedness and avoidance activities exclusively because of concerns about terrorism. Rather decisions were motivated by a combination of reasons. Residents of New York City and Washington, DC, men, and high-income respondents reported more preparedness activities, whereas low-income respondents, African Americans, and Hispanics reported more avoidance activities.</p>

<p>Experience with or exposure to a disaster has been hypothesized to directly or indirectly influence household preparation for future disasters. A major objective of the National Survey of Disaster Experiences and Preparedness (NSDEP) was to find out whether residents of geographic areas that either experienced (New York City, Washington, DC) or were threatened (Los Angeles County) by 9/11 were more likely than others to engage in proactive preparedness and avoidance activities following 9/11 and whether activities were done because of terrorism, natural disasters, other reasons, or some combination of reasons. A second objective was to find out whether preparedness and avoidance activities differed with gender, race/ethnicity, and income. Following a review of past research that examines how past experience and demographic characteristics correlate with preparedness and the reasons given for preparing, study hypotheses, methods, findings, and a discussion of the findings are presented.</p>
<sec id="section1-0013916510390318">
<title>Study Background</title>
<p>Most research on preparedness and hazard adjustment has focused on natural disasters such as earthquakes, wild fires, floods, and hurricanes. Overall, the amount of preparedness reported has been modest and the activities reported have focused on those that seem easier or less costly to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Prater, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510390318">Nguyen, Shen, Ershoff, Afifi, &amp; Bourque, 2006</xref>). The observed differences across households in what and how much was done have led to a search for variables that explain these differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916510390318">Lindell, IN PRESS</xref>). Included in this search were measures of gender, age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), household composition, marital status, perceived risk, past experience in disasters, objective risk, proximity to hazards, social influences, information seeking, behavioral intentions, personality characteristics, past adoption of hazard adjustments, and perceived responsibility for protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Perry, 2000</xref>). This analysis examines how gender, race/ethnicity, age, SES, and geographic location as a measure of past experience and exposure influence proactive preparedness and avoidance behaviors.</p>
<p>Historically, a number of overlapping and related sociological and social psychological theories have guided this search. Considered most relevant for this study is the protective action decision model (PADM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Perry, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916510390318">2004</xref>) that combines measures of social status and environmental exposure with social psychological constructs to examine the correlates of hazard adjustment and emergency preparedness. Unlike most studies using PADM, these analyses do not report multivariate models and do not include social psychological constructs. Rather, bivariate associations between measures of social status and environmental exposure, proactive preparedness, avoidance activities, and the reasons given for taking action are examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Hwang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510390318">Peacock, 2003</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0013916510390318">
<title>Past Experience</title>
<p>In a national survey, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916510390318">Council for Excellence in Government (2006)</xref> reported that people living in areas that had experienced past natural disasters were more likely to prepare for future events, including terrorism. A number of studies of natural disasters have examined how past experience and proximity to hazards affect hazard adjustment and emergency preparedness. Past experience has been measured by comparing households not at risk of a disaster to those that have recently experienced a disaster or that are in areas at future risk of a disaster. It has also been measured by examining the extent to which individuals report damage, injury, death, or other losses as the result of a disaster. Past experience appears to have the most impact on preparedness when it is recent and the impact was intense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916510390318">Heller, Alexander, Gatz, Knight, &amp; Rose, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916510390318">Jackson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510390318">Nguyen, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013916510390318">Siegel, Shoaf, Afifi, &amp; Bourque, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Most studies report a direct association between past experience and preparedness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013916510390318">Tekeli-Yeşil, Dedeoğlu, Braun-Fahrlaender, and Tanner (2010)</xref> reported that both past experience in an earthquake and having a home in a district at high risk of future earthquakes were associated with getting prepared. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916510390318">Grothmann and Reusswig (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013916510390318">Siegrist and Gutsher (2008)</xref> reported that past experience with floods was associated with purchase of flood protection devices and making structural improvements. In contrast, in an earlier study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013916510390318">Siegrist and Gutsher (2006)</xref> reported that past experience was not associated with preparedness, but residence in an area perceived by both officials and residents to be at high risk of flood was associated with preparedness. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510390318">Peacock (2003)</xref> reported an association between hurricane experience and shutter installation but not installation of envelope protection.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510390318">Lindell and Prater (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510390318">2002)</xref> reported that California residents were more likely than Washington residents to report earthquake experiences, which included property damage, injury, and death of family members or others. Earthquake experience was, in turn, associated with making hazard adjustments. In a later study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510390318">Lindell and Hwang (2008)</xref> reported that experience with both floods and wind was associated with making adjustments for flood and wind. In addition, flood experience was associated with buying flood insurance. The association between experience and making adjustments was mediated by perceived risk. Boscarino and colleagues reported that residents of New York City (14.8%) were more likely than residents in the rest of New York (6.1%) to report that they had made any preparations after 9/11 for a future terrorist attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916510390318">Boscarino, Adams, Figley, Galea, &amp; Foa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510390318">Boscarino, Figley, &amp; Adams, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A few studies report either marginal or no association between previous experience and household preparedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916510390318">Bosolo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510390318">Mileti &amp; Darlington, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916510390318">Mileti &amp; O’Brien, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510390318">Rincon, Linares, &amp; Greenberg, 2001</xref>). In this study, previous experience was measured by comparing residents of high-exposure areas that were directly affected (Washington, DC, and New York City) or threatened (Los Angeles County) by 9/11 with residents in the rest of the continental United States.</p>

<sec id="section3-0013916510390318">
<title>Demographic Characteristics</title>
<p>Associations between preparedness and demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, age, education, and income have been examined with mixed results. These variables are important as proxy measures of both resource availability and vulnerability. Research suggests that older persons, women, non-Whites, and persons with less education and income are more vulnerable than others to disasters at least in part because of less access to resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510390318">Fothergill &amp; Peek, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0013916510390318">
<title>Gender</title>
<p>Women and non-Whites usually perceive themselves to be at greater risk of a future disaster, but reported associations between gender, race/ethnicity, and preparedness are mixed. If non-Whites and women are more vulnerable to disasters, it suggests that they would prepare to reduce their risk. However, if racial and gender vulnerability are associated with having less access to resources such as education and income, it suggests that they would be less prepared. Unfortunately, even when data on gender and race/ethnicity are collected, associations with preparedness are not always reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916510390318">Bosolo et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on response to warnings has found that women are more likely to evacuate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510390318">Sorensen &amp; Sorensen, 2006</xref>). It has been hypothesized that women’s traditional roles as caretakers and household managers may explain these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510390318">Enarson, Fothergill, &amp; Peek, 2006</xref>). When examined in studies of preparedness, results are mixed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510390318">Lindell and Prater (2000</xref>) reported that women were less likely to make hazard adjustments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510390318">Eisenman et al. (2006)</xref> found that men were less likely to have emergency supplies and plans than women, but these differences disappeared in multivariate models that controlled for other variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916510390318">Fothergill (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510390318">1998)</xref> suggested that men and women might differ in the kinds of preparedness activities that they do. Mileti and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510390318">Mileti &amp; Darlington, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916510390318">Mileti &amp; Fitzpatrick, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916510390318">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916510390318">Mileti &amp; O’Brien, 1992</xref>;) reported mixed results as regards gender, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510390318">Nguyen et al. (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916510390318">Lee and Lemyre (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510390318">Lindell and Hwang (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013916510390318">Spittal, McClure, Siegert, and Walkey (2008)</xref> reported that gender was unrelated to taking preparedness actions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0013916510390318">
<title>Research Findings on Race and Ethnicity</title>
<p>Research on how race and ethnicity influence household decisions to prepare are mixed. Some research has found that Whites are more likely to prepare than either African Americans or Latinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510390318">Edwards, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916510390318">Faupel &amp; Styles, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013916510390318">Turner, Nigg, &amp; Heller-Paz, 1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510390318">Lindell and Hwang (2008)</xref> reported that Whites were more likely to have flood insurance, but non-Whites were more likely to have made flood adjustments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510390318">Peacock (2003)</xref> reported that African Americans were less likely to prepare, but Hispanics did not differ from White respondents. Others report that race/ethnicity was unrelated to taking preparedness actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Prater, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510390318">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies focused on terrorism conducted after September 11, 2001, report similarly mixed results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916510390318">Torabi and Seo (2004)</xref> reported that more African Americans than Whites organized supplies as a consequence of the attacks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510390318">Eisenman et al. (2006)</xref> reported that more African Americans established an emergency plan and that Latinos and African Americans were more likely than Whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders to purchase or maintain emergency supplies.</p>
<p>Following 9/11, the types of activities considered for inclusion in studies of preparedness expanded to include decisions to avoid activities and locations that were thought to increase exposure to terrorism. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, persons were repeatedly advised to avoid national landmarks, reduce their use of airplanes and trains, increase their vigilance, and, during the anthrax scare, change how their mail was handled. A few studies have examined the extent to which people report avoiding situations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916510390318">Torabi and Seo (2004)</xref> found that women and African Americans were more likely than men and Whites to limit outside activities or change modes of transportation because of terrorism. In Los Angeles, African Americans, Hispanics, and Korean Americans were more likely than Whites, Chinese Americans, or other Asian groups to “avoid things they wanted to do because of concerns about terrorism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510390318">Eisenman et al., 2009</xref>, p. 169).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0013916510390318">
<title>Socioeconomic Status</title>
<p>SES is most commonly measured by respondents’ education and income. It is generally assumed that hazard adjustment and preparedness increase with education and income, but recent research does not consistently report such relationships and, when found, they often disappear in multivariate models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916510390318">Lee and Lemyre (2009)</xref> reported a positive association between education and individual preparedness behavior but no association with avoidance behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013916510390318">Tekeli-Yeşil et al. (2010)</xref> also reported a positive association between education and preparedness for earthquakes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510390318">Lindell and Hwang (2008)</xref> reported a negative association between income and making hazard adjustments for wind but no associations between education and income and making flood adjustments or buying flood insurance. In multiple regressions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510390318">Lindell and Prater (2000</xref>) found income, but not education, to be a significant predictor of hazard adjustment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916510390318">Grothmann and Reusswig (2006)</xref> reported a direct association between income and purchasing flood protection devices, which disappears in multivariate analyses and no associations between education and hazard adjustments.</p>

<sec id="section7-0013916510390318">
<title>Attributes Associated With Preparedness Behaviors</title>
<p>Although numerous studies have examined the extent to which households prepare and programs have been developed to increase preparedness, particularly for earthquakes in California, actual levels of preparedness have remained low and concentrated on the purchase and storage of low-cost or perishable materials such as flashlights, battery operated radios, food, and water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916510390318">Heller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916510390318">Kelley, Wood, Kano, &amp; Bourque, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Perry, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510390318">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013916510390318">Tierney, Lindell, &amp; Perry, 2001</xref>). Household storage of water in California over the past 30 years has remained essentially constant, with 31% of households reporting no storage of water and an additional 27% reporting that they had stored less than the recommended 3 gallons per person per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916510390318">Kelley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510390318">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510390318">Russell, Goltz, &amp; Bourque, 1995</xref>). This is less than the 60% of households in selected communities in Washington and California who reported storing at least 4 gallons of water in 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916510390318">Lindell, Arlikatti, &amp; Prater, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Most research focuses on whether households prepare for a particular kind of disaster such as an earthquake or a hurricane. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510390318">Russell et al. (1995)</xref>, Lindell and colleagues suggest that to understand why people do or do not prepare, we need to know more about how they evaluate recommended activities apart from their usefulness in a disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916510390318">Lindell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Perry, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Prater, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Whitney, 2000</xref>).

<p>Lindell and colleagues examined whether one or more preparedness activities or hazard adjustments were more likely to be adopted when they were judged to be high on hazard-related attributes, such as efficacy in protecting persons, efficacy in protecting property, and suitability for other purposes, and low on resource-related attributes, such as cost, knowledge, skill requirements, required time and effort, and required cooperation with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916510390318">Lindell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Prater, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Whitney, 2000</xref>).

<title>Method</title>
<p>These analyses use the NSDEP to examine the extent to which the U.S. households have engaged in preparedness and avoidance behaviors since September 11, 2001. Results are reported by geographic area (high vs. low exposure to 9/11), gender, race/ethnic groups, and SES.</p>
<sec id="section10-0013916510390318">
<title>Sample Design</title>
<p>The sample for the NSDEP was stratified into two levels of exposure. High-experience (Washington, DC, including the District of Columbia, Arlington, Fairfax, Prince William, Loudoun, Montgomery, and Prince George’s counties, and New York City [Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island]) and high-exposure (Los Angeles County) areas were oversampled. The second stratum was the rest of the continental United States. The sample was drawn using random-digit-dialing (RDD) supplemented with random sampling from Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander surname lists.</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted with one adult resident from each of the 3,300 households studied. The response rate was 35%, calculated as the ratio of unweighted completion cases to estimated eligible cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916510390318">American Association for Public Opinion Research, 2009</xref>). This compares with response rates for landline RDD surveys of 21% for the Pew Research Center’s survey of Social Isolation and New Technology conducted in the summer of 2008, 24.3% for the Health Information National Trends Survey conducted in 2007, 21.1% for the California Health Interview Survey fielded in 2007 to 2008, and 35% for the California Earthquake Preparedness Survey fielded in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916510390318">Hampton, Sessions, Her, &amp; Rainie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916510390318">Kano, Wood, Kelley, &amp; Bourque, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916510390318">Lee &amp; Grant, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916510390318">National Cancer Institute, n.d.</xref>).

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected by computer-assisted telephone interviewing between April 13, 2007, and February 13, 2008. Interviews averaged 46 min and were conducted by California Survey Research Services (CSRS) under the supervision of the Survey Research Center at the University of California, Los Angeles. Interviews were conducted in English (94%) or Spanish (6%) at the request of the respondent.</p>
<p>CSRS offered a US$20 Target, WalMart or Barnes &amp; Noble gift card or a US$20 donation in the respondent’s name to one of three charities (American Red Cross, American Heart Association, and American Cancer Society) to those who completed the interview.</p>

<title>Questionnaire Content</title>
<p>The questionnaire was based on a comprehensive review of the literature on disaster preparedness and mitigation, public education, risk communication and warnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510390318">Mileti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013916510390318">Wood, Kano, Mileti, &amp; Bourque, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Demographic Characteristics</title>
<p>Standard questions were asked about gender, age, self-reported race/ethnicity, number of years of schooling completed, and household income. Age, years of schooling and income were analyzed both as interval variables and dichotomized at the median for cross-tabular analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0013916510390318">
<title>Preparedness and Avoidance Activities</title>
<p>Six questions were asked about proactive preparedness activities that the household had done since September 11, 2001: developing emergency plans, stockpiling supplies, purchasing things to be safer, learning where to get more information about terrorism, duplicating important documents, and becoming more vigilant. Seven questions were asked about avoidance activities: reducing travel by plane, reducing travel by train, reducing use of public transportation, changing mail handling procedures, avoiding certain cities, avoiding tall buildings, and avoiding national landmarks. For each activity reported, respondents were asked whether the activity was done because of terrorism, natural disasters, other reasons, or any combination of these three. Activities done exclusively because of terrorism and those done for any combination of reasons are reported here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0013916510390318">
<title>Analytical Strategy</title>
<p>Analyses use the unweighted sample so that comparisons can be made across geographic areas and race/ethnic groups. The percentage of respondents who reported each activity, the percentage that had done at least one preparedness activity, the percentage who had done at least one avoidance activity, the mean number of preparedness activities, and the mean number of avoidance activities are reported here.</p>
<p>Pearson chi-square was used to test associations between individual preparedness and avoidance activities and geographic area of residence, gender, race/ethnicity, and SES. To test Hypothesis 3a, residents in the high-exposure areas (Los Angeles, New York, and Washington, DC) were compared with those in the rest of the continental United States. To test Hypothesis 3c, White and Asian/Pacific Islanders were compared with Hispanic and African American respondents. Chi-square tests also examined the associations between preparedness and avoidance activities and the four areas of residence (New York City, Washington, DC, Los Angeles County, and rest of the United States) and the four race/ethnic groups (White, Asian/Pacific Islanders, African Americans, and Hispanics). One-way analysis of variance, with ad hoc contrasts and Bonferroni post hoc tests, examined associations between the summed counts of proactive preparedness activities and avoidance activities and areas of residence, gender, race/ethnicity, and SES. Because of the sample size, hypotheses were tested at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>

<p>Weighting was (a) designed to account for the differential selection probabilities associated with the sample design by calculating sampling weights that are inversely proportional to selection probabilities and scaled to sum to the sample size of 3,300 and (b) intended to bring the distributions of key demographic characteristics into conformance with national population totals using WesVar software from Westat in Rockville, Maryland, to “rake” the sampling weights so that the weighted demographics matched population control values.</p>

<p>Findings are presented in the order of the hypotheses. Overall findings (Hypotheses 1-2) are reported first, followed by exposure area (Hypothesis 3a), gender (Hypothesis 3b), race/ethnicity (Hypothesis 3c), and income (Hypothesis 3d). How proactive preparedness behavior and avoidance behavior varied with respondents’ age and education were examined but are not presented. As regards age and regardless of whether cross-tabular, correlational, or analysis of variance techniques were used, there were no differences by age in respondents’ reports of preparedness and avoidance behavior. As regards years of schooling completed, the pattern of associations was identical to those found with income.</p>

Neither Hypothesis 1 nor Hypothesis 2 was completely supported. A total of 71% of respondents, rather than the less than 25% hypothesized, reported doing at least one preparedness activity exclusively because of terrorism, but only 22.9% reported at least one avoidance activity because of terrorism. Consistent with Hypothesis 2, more than 50% reported doing at least one preparedness activity for any reason, but only 46% did at least one avoidance activity for any reason. On average, respondents reported doing 1.04 of 6 preparedness activities exclusively because of terrorism and an additional 1.7 preparedness activities for a combination of reasons. On average, respondents did 0.34 avoidance activities because of terrorism and 0.86 for any reason.</p>

<p>With the exception of learning how to get more information (59.2%), respondents were much less likely to report doing activities exclusively because of terrorism than for a combination of reasons. Where 3.9% developed emergency plans exclusively because of terrorism, an additional 28.2% developed emergency plans for a combination of reasons that might or might not include terrorism. Reasons given for avoidance activities were similar but not as extreme. Where 6.2% reduced airplane travel exclusively because of terrorism, an additional 12.1% reduced air travel for a combination of reasons.</p>
<p>Almost 60% of the respondents said that they learned how to get more information and 71% said they became more vigilant exclusively because of concerns about terrorism. Of the 1,979 of the 2,990 (66.2%) persons who reported learning more and/or becoming more vigilant exclusively because of terrorism, 90.6% (1,793/1,979) did none of the more difficult preparedness activities (making plans, stockpiling supplies, purchasing things to be safer, and duplicating documents). Of the 998 who learned where to get information but did not become more vigilant, 94.5% (944/998) did no additional activities, and of the 327 who became more vigilant but did not learn where to get information, 90.5% (296/327) did no additional activities. And, finally, of the 654 who learned where to get information and became more vigilant, 84.5% (553/654) did no additional activities.</p>

<sec id="section19-0013916510390318">
<title>Differences by Terrorism Experience and Exposure</title>
<p>With the exception of reporting at least one avoidance activity because of terrorism, Hypothesis 3a is rejected. Respondents in the three high-experience and high-exposure areas were no more likely than residents in the rest of the United States to report doing at least one preparedness activity because of terrorism, one preparedness activity for any reason, or one avoidance activity for any reason. They were more likely to report at least one avoidance activity because of terrorism (27.2% vs. 21.1%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Residents of the three high-exposure areas were more likely than those in the rest of the United States to develop emergency plans (6.8% vs. 2.7%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), stockpile supplies (4.5% vs. 1.3%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), increase vigilance (40.8% vs. 31.9%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and reduce train travel (2.1% vs. 0.6%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) exclusively because of terrorism and were more likely to stockpile supplies (42.8% vs. 34.2%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for any combination of reasons. Regardless of geographic exposure area, respondents were more likely to report that they did activities for a variety of reasons and not just because of terrorism.</p>
<p>Contributing to the rejection of Hypothesis 3a is the fact that Los Angeles residents behaved more like residents in the rest of the United States than they did like residents of New York City and Washington, DC, who experienced 9/11. Bonferroni post hoc tests show that the number of proactive preparedness activities done because of terrorism is higher in the two cities who experienced 9/11 (New York City [1.3] and Washington, DC [1.4]) than in Los Angeles (0.9) and the rest of the United States (1.0). When individual activities are examined, New York and Washington, DC, residents were more likely to have emergency plans (9.3% vs. 2.8%), stockpile supplies (5.8% vs. 1.5%), purchase things to be safer (6.8% vs. 2.4%), and be more vigilant (48.5% vs. 31.7%). There were no differences between the high-exposure cities and the rest of the country (including Los Angeles) in avoidance activities done because of terrorism or in either preparedness or avoidance activities done for any reason.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0013916510390318">
<title>Differences by Gender</title>
<p>Hypothesis 3b is partially rejected. Men (75.8%) were more likely than women (68.6%) to report doing at least one preparedness activity but less likely (19.2% vs. 25.2%) to report doing at least one avoidance activity. Men and women did not differ in reports of doing at least one preparedness activity for any reason (93% vs. 94%), but women (50%) were more likely than men (39.7%) to report doing at least one avoidance activity for any reason. Men were more likely than women to do all six preparedness activities because of terrorism, with learning how to get more information (65.7% vs. 55.1%) and purchasing things to be safer (4.1% vs. 2.6%) being significantly higher and the mean number of activities being higher for men (1.1) than women (0.98). Women did more avoidance activities because of terrorism, but only the mean number of activities (0.4 vs. 0.3) is significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>The trends observed for reporting activities because of terrorism hold when respondents report doing activities for any reason. Men reported doing more preparedness activities, but only purchasing supplies (27.3% vs. 19.3%) and learning where to get information (67% vs. 55.8%) were significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Women reported more avoidance activities, but only avoiding cities (22.3% vs. 15.9%), tall buildings (13.1% vs. 8.2%), and national landmarks (7.8% vs. 3.1%) were significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0013916510390318">
<title>Differences by Race and Ethnicity</title>
<p>For purposes of testing Hypothesis 3c, White and Asians/Pacific Islanders were grouped together on the basis of their similar SES and because the few studies of preparedness that include Asians/Pacific Islanders report mixed results for Asians/Pacific Islander subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510390318">Eisenman et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510390318">2009</xref>). Hypothesis 3c that predicts that African Americans and Hispanics will be more likely than Whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders to report preparedness and avoidance activities was largely rejected. Whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders (73%) were more likely than African Americans and Hispanics (66%) to report doing at least one preparedness activity because of terrorism (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). There were no differences between the two groups in the percentage that reported doing at least one preparedness activity for any reason (93.8% vs. 93.0%) or doing one avoidance activity because of terrorism (22.4% vs. 24.4%). African Americans and Hispanics (53.1%) were more likely than Whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders (43.8%) to report doing at least one avoidance activity for any reason.</p>
<p>As regards specific preparedness activities done because of terrorism, Whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders (60.9%) were more likely than African Americans and Hispanics (53.8%) to learn where to get information. As regards specific avoidance activities done because of terrorism, more Hispanics and African Americans reduced plane (9% vs. 5.4%) and train (2.5% vs. 0.6%) travel and avoided tall buildings (6.2% vs. 2.7%) and national landmarks (4.8% vs. 2.2%).</p>
<p>When asked about doing activities for any reason, more Hispanics and African Americans stored supplies (44.7% vs. 34.3%), purchased things to be safer (28% vs. 20.6%), reduced travel by plane (23% vs. 16.8%), train (11.9% vs. 5.3%), and public transportation (14.6% vs. 7.1%), and avoided tall buildings (19% vs. 8.7%) and national landmarks (9.5% vs. 4.9%). In contrast, more Whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders learned where to get information (61.9% vs. 54.3%).</p>
<p>Post hoc Bonferroni tests indicate that Asians/Pacific Islanders (0.5) were less likely than either Hispanics (1.2) or African Americans (1.1) to report avoidance activities for any reason and Whites (.8) were less likely than Hispanics (1.2) to report avoidance activities for any reason.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0013916510390318">
<title>Differences by Income</title>
<p>Hypothesis 3d predicts that persons with higher SES will report doing more preparedness and avoidance activities than those with lower SES. Analyses examined associations with both education and income, but because the pattern of findings is essentially identical for both measures of SES, only associations with income are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013916510390318">Table 4</xref>. Hypothesis 3d is accepted for preparedness activities but rejected for avoidance activities regardless of the reasons given for activities. Higher SES respondents were more likely than lower SES respondents to report doing at least one preparedness activity exclusively because of terrorism (77.9% vs. 63.6%) and for any combination of reasons (95.8% vs. 91.1%). Differences in the likelihood that the respondents reported doing at least one avoidance activity because of terrorism (25.1% vs. 20.2%) or because of any reason (44.4% vs. 47.9%) were not significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>In looking at the specific activities reported, high-SES respondents were more likely than low-SES respondents to learn how to get more information either specifically because of terrorism (64% vs. 53.4%) or for any reason (65.2% vs. 54.1%) and to report becoming more vigilant because of terrorism (40.2% vs. 27%). High-SES respondents were more likely than low-SES respondents to develop emergency plans (35.6% vs. 27.9%) and duplicate documents (41.3% vs. 34.2%) for any combination of reasons.</p>
<p>As regards avoidance activities, consistent with Hypothesis 3d, high-SES respondents were more likely to avoid certain cities (13% vs. 7.8%) and less likely to avoid tall buildings (2.1% vs. 5.2%) exclusively because of terrorism. High-income respondents were less likely to reduce plane travel (14.4% vs. 22.9%), reduce train travel (3.7% vs. 10.7%), reduce use of public transportation (5.4% vs. 13%), avoid tall buildings (6.6% vs. 16.7%), and avoid national landmarks (3.3% vs. 9.2%) for any combination of reasons.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The answer to the question posed in the title—Who Prepares for Terrorism?—is that very few people prepare exclusively because of concerns about terrorism. On average, households reported 2.7 preparedness activities and less than 1 avoidance activity, with even fewer activities done exclusively because of terrorism. The activities reported most frequently were those that seem the easiest to do. A total of 60% of respondents learned where to get information about terrorism and preparedness and 84.4% became more vigilant. Hypotheses about how preparedness differs with past exposure to or threats of terrorism, gender, race/ethnicity, and income were either rejected or only weakly supported.</p>
<sec id="section24-0013916510390318">
<title>Effects of Experience</title>
<p>Residents of New York City and the Washington, DC, area reported more preparedness and avoidance because of terrorism, but residents of Los Angeles like those in the rest of the United States reported doing little because of terrorism. When the reasons given for activities were broadened, more Los Angeles residents had emergency plans (37.3%) and stockpiled supplies (49.7%) than those in the other three areas. This may reflect the fact that Los Angeles residents have been urged to prepare for earthquakes.</p>
<p>These findings tend to contradict earlier studies of natural disasters, which generally report that previous experience motivates preparedness behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916510390318">Grothmann &amp; Reusswig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013916510390318">Siegrist &amp; Gutsher, 2008</xref>). At the same time, other research suggests that past experience has its greatest impact on preparedness when its impact is both recent and intense (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510390318">Nguyen, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013916510390318">Siegel et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, data were collected more than 5 years after 9/11, and previous experience was measured by residence in geographic areas that experienced or were exposed to 9/11. Participants were not asked whether they had experienced damage, injury, death, or other losses as a result of 9/11. Both factors may have weakened the effect of 9/11 on preparedness and avoidance behaviors.</p>

<sec id="section25-0013916510390318">
<title>Effects of Demographic Variables</title>
<p>In contrast to expectations, men did more preparedness activities than women both because of terrorism and for all reasons. Women reported more avoidance behaviors, but differences between men and women in all activities were modest. Although inconsistent with research that reports women more likely than men to evacuate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510390318">Sorensen &amp; Sorensen, 2006</xref>), these findings are consistent with previous research on preparing for natural disasters where differences between men and women have been at best modest (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Hwang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510390318">Mileti &amp; Darlington, 1995</xref>). To the extent that gender acts as a proxy measure of perceived vulnerability to disasters (which was not measured in this study), female reports of more avoidance behaviors might reflect feelings that they are more vulnerable to future terrorism.</p>
<p>Male reports of more preparedness activities may reflect the broad social science literature that consistently finds women to have fewer financial resources (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916510390318">Cooke, Boyle, &amp; Couch, 2009</xref>). Women (US$62,625) in this study also reported lower household incomes than men (US$74,802). Although no more than 4% of the variance is explained, when the associations between gender, income, and each of the 13 preparedness and avoidance activities are examined, both gender and income are independently associated with purchasing things to be safer, learning where to get information about terrorism, and avoiding travel to certain cities, tall buildings, and national landmarks. Income, but not gender, is associated with developing emergency plans, duplicating documents, changing mail handling, and reducing train travel and use of public transportation. Gender and income interact in their association with reducing plane travel and becoming more vigilant for any reason, such that women with less than US$50,000 income were most likely to reduce plane travel and men with less than US$50,000 in income were least likely to become more vigilant.</p>
<p>Past research has reported that African Americans and Hispanics are more likely both to prepare for and to avoid situations because of terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510390318">Eisenman et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510390318">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916510390318">Torabi &amp; Seo, 2004</xref>). These analyses weakly replicate those findings particularly when avoidance activities done exclusively because of terrorism are examined. Past research on natural disasters reports mixed findings regarding how race and ethnicity are associated with preparedness behaviors, with some research reporting no associations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Prater, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510390318">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>) and others reporting modest differences in preparedness by White and non-White respondents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510390318">Peacock, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013916510390318">Turner et al., 1986</xref>). Like gender, differences in preparedness and avoidance activities between African Americans, Hispanics, Whites, and Asians/Pacific Islanders in part reflect differences in household income, with African Americans and Hispanics (US$47,603) in this study having lower incomes than Whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders (US$66,155).</p>
<p>High-income respondents were more likely to report preparedness activities, but low-income respondents were more likely to report avoidance activities. These findings are consistent with past research on natural disasters where preparedness activities were directly associated with income and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916510390318">Grothmann &amp; Reusswig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Prater, 2000</xref>) but not consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916510390318">Lee and Lemyre’s (2009)</xref> report that there was no association between SES and avoidance behavior. As noted above, income is of greater salience than gender or race/ethnicity in predicting differences in preparedness and avoidance activities.</p>

<title>Comparison With Previous Studies of Terrorism</title>
<p>The NSDEP was fielded 6½ to 7½ years after 9/11. As such, the relevance of terrorism as a motivator of preparedness and avoidance behaviors might have decayed over time. To the extent that findings can be compared with other studies that examined whether terrorism motivated preparedness and avoidance behaviors, NSDEP reports of preparedness behaviors done exclusively because of terrorism were lower than those reported in two of the three studies available for comparisons, but reports of avoidance behaviors are relatively similar. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916510390318">Boscarino et al. (2006)</xref> reported that 5.4% of the residents of New York City had taken one or more terrorism precaution 1 year after 9/11, which rose to 14.8% after 2 years. This is substantially lower than the 71.4% of NSDEP respondents who reported at least one preparedness activity because of terrorism, and the 22.9% that reported at least one avoidance activity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916510390318">Torabi and Seo (2004)</xref> reported that 25% of a national sample reported that they had limited outside activities because of terrorism, 23% had changed their mode of transportation, and 15% had gathered emergency supplies 1 year after 9/11. This compares with the 22.9% of NSDEP respondents who reported at least one avoidance activity, the 7.3% who had changed one or more modes of transportation, and the 2.3% that stockpiled supplies specifically because of terrorism. However, when findings are broadened to include activities done for any reason, NSDEP respondents were more likely to have developed emergency plans (32.1%) and stockpiled supplies (36.8%).</p>
<p>NSDEP respondents’ reports of developing emergency plans (3.9%) and stockpiling supplies (2.3%) specifically because of terrorism are lower than the 17.1% of Los Angeles respondents who developed an emergency plan and the 28% who stockpiled supplies because of terrorism 1 year after 9/11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510390318">Eisenman et al., 2006</xref>), but the 5.1% of Los Angeles residents who often or very often avoided activities because of terrorism 3 years after 9/11 is substantially lower than the 26.7% of Los Angeles residents in NSDEP who did one or more avoidance activities because of terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510390318">Eisenman et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0013916510390318">
<title>Reasons Given for Actions</title>
<p>The most striking finding in this study is that households who report proactive preparedness activities and avoidance activities rarely give terrorism as the reason for those activities. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510390318">Russell and colleagues’ (1995)</xref> findings for earthquakes, activities reported for protection against terrorist attacks were performed for a variety of reasons—with terrorism being only one among many reasons. Only learning where to get information was motivated substantially by concerns about terrorism. In spite of the fact that vigilance was actively promoted as an important response to terrorism after 9/11 and the continuing loud speaker announcements in airports and other arenas “to watch your bags,” respondents reported that even increased vigilance was often done for reasons other than terrorism.</p>
<p>The few avoidance behaviors reported were more often motivated by terrorism than were decisions to proactively prepare by having emergency plans, stockpiling supplies, purchasing supplies to be safer, or duplicating documents. Concerns about terrorism simply did not motivate U.S. households to invest in proactive preparedness activities. This pattern is consistent across geographic areas, gender, race/ethnicity, and income groups. White men, those with high incomes, residents of New York City and Washington, DC, and African Americans and Hispanics were somewhat more likely than other groups to report preparedness and avoidance activities, but in no instance did any subgroup report that their behavior was motivated more by terrorism than by other factors unrelated to terrorism.</p>
<p>Drawing on earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510390318">Edwards, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510390318">Russell et al., 1995</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510390318">Lindell and Perry (2000)</xref> suggested that apart from their relevance for a disaster, how recommended hazard adjustments are evaluated, including their effectiveness, cost and utility for other purposes, might determine whether a behavior was adopted. Recently, Lindell and colleagues examined whether intentions to engage in hazard adjustments were associated with seven attributes of hazard adjustments, namely their ability to protect people or property, their utility for other purposes, cost, and the need for specialized knowledge, time and effort, and cooperation from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916510390318">Lindell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Prater, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Whitney, 2000</xref>). Although the findings are complex, respondents’ perceptions that hazard adjustments would have utility for other purposes were associated both with intentions to prepare and with actual preparedness activities.</p>
<p>The NSDEP asked about actual preparedness, not about intentions to prepare. Respondents were not asked whether the 13 preparedness and avoidance behaviors had utility for other purposes or whether they could protect people and property. Nor were questions asked about the resources needed to implement these activities. The fact, however, that many respondents reported that they engaged in preparedness and avoidance for reasons other than terrorism suggests that factors such as general utility and cost are considered when decisions are made.</p>
<p>Drawing from the attributes examined by Lindell and colleagues, the utility of an activity for purposes beyond disasters would seem relevant in understanding why NSDEP respondents gave “other reasons” for investing in preparedness activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916510390318">Lindell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Prater, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Whitney, 2000</xref>). Evaluations of the cost and need for specialized knowledge, time and effort, and cooperation from others would seem to be most relevant in explaining lack of preparedness. It is more difficult to know what attributes might be of greatest relevance in understanding the “other reasons” given by NSDEP respondents for doing avoidance activities. Changing modes of transportation, mail handling procedures, and travel destinations can involve costs in time, money, convenience, and reduced freedom and increase the need for specialized knowledge and the cooperation of other people.</p>

<title>Implications for Policy and Practice</title>
<p>Once again we face the conundrum that even with the impetus of 9/11, U.S. households remain remarkably unprepared for disasters and emergencies, including terrorism. The only hopeful sign is that efforts to increase household preparedness may have been too narrowly focused. Instead of focusing exclusively on what people have done to prepare for earthquakes, hurricanes, or terrorism, maybe the questions need to be broadened to ask what they have done and what they have obtained for reasons unrelated to disasters. In encouraging preparedness, practitioners and policy makers need to simultaneously broaden, increase, and simplify their messages. Many households have working flashlights, manual can openers, and first aid kits, but they did not get them to prepare for natural disasters or terrorism. They got them because they were useful for everyday life, for camping trips, or for any of a myriad of other uses.</p>
<p>Most efforts to increase preparedness are one-shot affairs that are passive in nature and focus on preparing for a specific, narrowly defined event. A single “day of preparedness” or a website is unlikely to increase preparedness.</p>
<p>The key question is behavioral: how do you help people to stop, listen, and get ready for future disasters that most think would not really happen, and, if they do, will happen to other people and not them? Most people think that way because they think that they are not at risk of high-consequence, low-probability events. This perception of being safe is reinforced every day that a disaster does not occur. Perceptions of “being safe” change to perceptions of “being at risk” immediately after a disaster. Research has demonstrated, however, that perceptions of risk decline and perceptions of safety increase to predisaster levels within a 2-year period (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916510390318">Burton, Kates, &amp; White, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916510390318">Weinstein, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>In the absence of an actual disaster, two factors are by far the strongest motivators of household preparedness and mitigation. The first is “information received” about readiness. To be effective, information must come from multiple sources, be communicated over multiple channels of communication, focus on what actions to take, explain how those actions cut future losses, and be consistent (the same) across the different messages received (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Perry, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Whitney, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916510390318">Mileti, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510390318">Sorensen &amp; Sorensen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013916510390318">Tierney et al., 2001</xref>). The second factor is “information observed.” The impact of “seeing” others prepare and mitigate is generally stronger than passively receiving information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510390318">Mileti &amp; Darlington, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916510390318">Mileti &amp; Fitzpatrick, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916510390318">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916510390318">Mileti &amp; O’Brien, 1992</xref>). Moreover, the information to action-taking is cumulative: the more information disseminated to households, the more they prepare and mitigate; the less information, the less preparedness and mitigation. As replicated in these analyses, other factors such as where you live, whether you are a man or a woman, how much income you have, and the racial/ethnic groups with which you identify do not matter much.</p>
<p>Actively connecting preparedness activities with other daily activities might also increase preparedness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916510390318">Wood et al. (2009)</xref> developed the “Get Ready” Pyramid as a framework within which readiness recommendations can be made. The seven levels of the pyramid are organized from those that cost little to those that are expensive to do.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Actions toward the base of the pyramid are intended to engage people further by attuning them to actions they can perform at little or no financial cost, and to things they already know or have, most likely for other reasons, but have not previously recognized as useful for disasters. (p. 34)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With the exception of the first level that focuses on learning how to be ready, actions can be completed in any order.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Like all cross-sectional population-based surveys, the NSDEP provides a picture of a population at one point in time and does not allow for analyses over time. Behaviors are self-reported and may be subject to acquiescence and other forms of bias and misreporting. The fact that the reported prevalence of both preparedness and avoidance behaviors was so low, regardless of the reason given for doing them, suggests that “yea-saying” was low or nonexistent in this study. If there was a constant reporting bias in the reasons given for doing activities across all residential areas, both genders and income groups and all ethnic groups, it will not affect the differences reported. If, in contrast, there is a constant level of random misreporting, it could introduce bias that would decrease support for the differences reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510390318">Lindell &amp; Perry, 2000</xref>). The need to collect information across a number of substantive areas while keeping interviews at a reasonable length and cost meant that the number of questions about preparedness and avoidance had to be restricted and generic questions about stockpiling supplies, for example, had to be asked instead of questions about the different kinds of supplies on hand.</p>
<p>In spite of these limitations, NSDEP is one of the few national surveys that has been conducted since September 11, 2001, with subsamples that allow areas affected by terrorism to be compared with the rest of the continental United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916510390318">Wood, Kano, Mileti, &amp; Bourque, 2009</xref>).</p>
