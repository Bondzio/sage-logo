<sec id="section2-1523422312446147">
<title>The Solution.</title>
<p>As the concept has evolved and moved around the world in response to factors supporting globalization, and as academics and practitioners have argued about its definition, HRD has begun to be applied much more broadly, including with geographically dispersed communities and nations. This article presents case studies in which HRD principles and theories have been used for societal development—the general improvement of the welfare of people usually outside of the workplace, primarily in communities. At least one of the coauthors, and usually two or more, have been either involved in or reported on all of the cases included.</p>

<body>
<p>The field of human resource development (HRD), as an academic field, is relatively new, having emerged about 50 years ago with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422312446147">Harbison and Myers (1964)</xref>. Subsequent to its inception, HRD has focused primarily on the corporate world and government-level agencies. HRD has now evolved into a much broader focus. One definition of HRD is
<disp-quote><p>Human resource development is any process or activity that, either initially or over the long term, has the potential to develop . . . work-based knowledge, expertise, productivity and satisfaction, whether for personal or group/team gain, or for the benefit of an organization, community, nation, or, ultimately, the whole of humanity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422312446147">McLean &amp; McLean, 2001</xref>, p. 322)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As a result of this evolution, HRD principles and processes are now being used increasingly used in community and national development. In fact, two issues of <italic>Advances in Developing Human Resources</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312446147">Lynham, Paprock, &amp; Cunningham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422312446147">McLean, Osman-Gani, &amp; Cho, 2004</xref>) focused entirely on how human resource development principles are being used for national development in many aspects, including health, safety, education, productivity, culture, and so on. The issues contained case studies of how HRD principles are being applied in countries and consortia of countries around the world. This application has been articulated even further in the newsletter of the Organization Development and Change Division of the Academy of Management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312446147">McLean, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1523422312446147">
<title>Purpose of This Article and Inclusion Criterion</title>
<p>Based on the evolving and expanding concept of HRD to include organizations and institutions that impact societal development, the purpose of this article is to share examples of case studies that have used HRD to demonstrate how HRD has been used to support societal development.</p>
<p>As with all case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422312446147">Yin, 2008</xref>), these case studies are intended to be illustrative only and are not intended to generalize. Rather, the intent is to offer examples that might suggest further application in moving toward testing actionable theory.</p>
<p>All of the cases included in this article, intentionally, have been selected from situations in which at least one of the coauthors, and usually two or more, have been either involved in or reported on the cases included.</p>

<sec id="section5-1523422312446147">
<title>Case Studies of OD for Societal Development</title>
<p>These cases are not exhaustive, even of our experiences, let alone generalizable to a larger population of such experiences. Informal conversations with global HRD sojourners have suggested that there are many such examples. And in many cases, including some of the examples here, those involved in the projects were not knowledgeable about HRD, but the resulting stories serve as examples of how such experiences did, indeed, perhaps through serendipity, reflect HRD principles, theories, and practices.</p>

<title>Development of HRD Consultants for NGOs in Pakistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422312446147">McLean &amp; Armey, 1990</xref>)</title>
<p>In the early 1990s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422312446147">McLean and Arney (1990)</xref>, under a grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), worked with a group of Pakistani consultants from societal development nongovernmental (NGO) agencies to develop their consulting competencies. The idea was to provide indigenous consultants who could work in societal development for the purposes of improving and developing communities. The primary tools used were training and coaching, both core HRD tools. The primary foci of the agencies involved were women development, women’s health, family planning, and adult literacy, among others. Unfortunately, with the discovery that Pakistan was actively pursuing nuclear weaponry, the project was cancelled after 2 years, 1 year short of the intended conclusion. Nevertheless, it was sufficient in providing the participants with basic consulting skills.</p>

<title>Pakistan Village Development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312446147">Budhwani &amp; McLean, 2005</xref>)</title>
<p>Still in Pakistan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312446147">Budhwani and McLean (2005)</xref> described an extensive case study of villages in Hunza and Gilgit, northern areas of Pakistan that used action research, a systematic process of organizational analysis, planning, implementation, and evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422312446147">McLean, 2006b</xref>), under the auspices of the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), to enhance the lives of the people of the villages within a culturally acceptable manner. The outcome of the project was to enhance the role of women, improve health and health care, reduce poverty through building entrepreneurship, and dramatically improve the educational opportunities for all children of the villages. The project has now extended to almost 1,100 villages in northern Pakistan and is a model that AKDN, a community outreach arm of Ismaili Muslims, is using throughout much of Central and South Asia and elsewhere for community development. In addition to highlighting the importance of involving beneficiaries in action research, the aforementioned efforts suggest that HRD can be applied to a broad range of situations to produce desired outcomes.</p>

<title>Moroccan Village Development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312446147">McLean, 2006a</xref>)</title>
<p>With support from faculty members at Al-Akhawayn University in Ifrane, Morocco, this project focused on developing a cooperative of farmers and villagers in Dayt Aoua Region. Using action research, as described above, the project had a number of objectives: (a) to assist the farmers in changing their crops from wheat and corn to lavender; (b) to provide transportation for primary school graduates, especially female, to attend middle school in nearby Ifrane (about a 50-min bus ride); (c) to increase the literacy of village women; (d) to improve the rate of vaccinations; (e) to provide health information to village women, e.g., family planning, OB/GYN issues, nutrition, hygiene, and so forth; and (f) to conduct membership campaigns to extend the impact of the above objectives.</p>
<p>While this remains a work in progress, there are already a few lessons learned. First, these villagers became much more open to change, a major outcome of HRD, as they were allowed to provide leadership. Second, the facilitators wisely exercised great patience-pushing for change too quickly would likely have sidetracked the project. Third, the welfare of children can be a powerful motivator. These lessons are based on the observations of the first author; they were not gathered from the project facilitators or participants. HRD tools used in this project included process consultation, facilitation, training, and coaching.</p>

<title>Moroccan Azrou Center for Local Community Services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312446147">McLean, 2006a</xref>)</title>
<p>Another HRD project supported by Al-Akhawayn University is located at the Azrou Center for Local Community Services. This project began with a needs assessment in a standard HRD approach, conducted by two faculty members from the United States. It currently offers the following services to women: support for primary and secondary students in French, English, and mathematics; provision of computer training for baccalaureate and unemployed degree holders, both male and female; literacy instruction for women and unschooled young girls; sensitization courses (hygiene, environmental protection, civics, nutrition, education); gynecological consulting; medical analysis laboratory; family planning; infantile health; support for diabetic children; and support for disabled children (primarily, physiotherapy). Future activities include assistance for women for the creation and management of cooperatives; establishment of a center that will provide assistance for women and children in difficulty (e.g., domestic abuse); and cultural activities. This is a well-established program with great support from the university and the community, thanks, in part, to the application of HRD processes, primarily through the ongoing use of action research.</p>

<title>Ismaili Community Center in Minnesota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422312446147">Budhwani, 2006</xref>)</title>
<p>Using extensive interviews, observations, and examination of documents, traditional HRD approaches for organizational analysis, Budhwani explored how a Jamat Khana, a place of assembly or community center for Ismaili Muslims, that serves the community in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, had used and was using HRD to develop its community, both internally and externally. He found that several aspects of HRD were used for developing leadership, providing career development, providing opportunities for women’s development, supporting social activities, incorporating diversity within the community by bringing together community members from many countries, providing financial counseling, providing literacy training, and improving many other community development processes, all of which served to strengthen the community.</p>

<title>Development of K-12 Educational System in Kyrgyzstan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312446147">McLean, Karimov, &amp; Asankanov, 2004</xref>)</title>
<p>The primary thrust of this almost 4-year project in Kyrgyzstan, sponsored by the U.S. State Department, was to develop graduate level Educational Management programs in two universities (Arabaev Kyrgyz State Pedagogical University in Bishkek, and Osh Higher Education Pedagogical Institute in Osh) to provide both preservice and inservice degree-level education for school directors (principals) and zovuchs (vice principals), as well as zavraiono/gorono/zavoblono (superintendents from smallest to largest school districts), to replace the solely relationship-based criteria previously in place. In the process, support was given to the development of a new educational reform bill, including the reinstitution of state support for kindergartens, the requirement that all schools have a board of directors, greater transparency for all public school budgets, a system of statewide university entrance exams, and so on. The processes used were those associated with action research, including entry, start-up, assessment and feedback, collaborative action planning, implementation, extensive evaluation, institutionalization, and, finally, separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422312446147">McLean, 2006b</xref>).</p>

<title>Village Development in Lumpaya Community, Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312446147">Yamnill, Singsuriya, &amp; McLean, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312446147">Yamnill &amp; McLean, 2011</xref>)</title>
<p>A village located outside of Bangkok had experienced significant economic challenges in which the farming community could no longer keep up with changing technology, having a domino effect on the community’s economy. Core members of the community approached Mahidol University, Thailand, to promote community empowerment and poverty alleviation. Using action research and focusing on the principles and application of knowledge management (creation, interpretation, dissemination, use, retention, and refinement of knowledge) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312446147">de Jarnett, 1999</xref>), a team from Mahidol University joined with the Subdistrict Administrative Organization, schools, village elders, and the local Buddhist temple to explore options. The farmers and merchants in the floating market became part of a living museum, associated with the temple. School children collected artifacts from their families, along with oral histories, all of which were displayed in the museum. The floating market was revitalized, and new merchants were recruited from nearby villages. The viability of the village was affirmed, and the economy greatly strengthened through this process.</p>
<p>In a follow-up study 5 years later, it was affirmed that the action research methods included in the original study were continuing, and the community was continuing to develop. The number of floating market merchants had tripled, and it had become almost impossible to find a parking spot on the weekend because of the large numbers of visitors. New ideas had been implemented, and others were being planned. The collaboration of parties in the action research has continued to be effective; such collaboration in the high power distance culture of Thailand is unusual.</p>

<title>Buddhist Temple Development in Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422312446147">Yamnill, McLean, &amp; Singsuriva, 2008</xref>)</title>
<p>Wat Panyanantaram, a Buddhist temple in Thailand, was selected by a committee of the Office of National Education Commission, Office of the Prime Minister, as a 2002 Outstanding Buddhist Temple. This temple and its abbot were well known for their commitment to the use of HRD processes for the purposes of moral, social, and community development. The primary tools identified from the case study were needs assessment, leadership development, training, social and moral development through retreats and instruction, collaborative leadership, extensive formative and summative evaluation, and so on.</p>

<title>Neighborhood Development in a Bangalore, India, Slum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312446147">Shariff &amp; McLean, in press</xref>)</title>
<p>In spite of the image of Bangalore as the IT capital of the world, over 20% of its population, nearly one million people, live in poverty in slums. In response to this need, a group of 20 expatriate Indian professionals in Saudi Arabia formed a charitable trust in the late 1980s with the purpose of alleviating poverty and improving the living conditions of slum dwellers in the city. The trust invested in commercial property to provide an ongoing source of income. The income funded the education assistance plan whereby parents were paid 20 cents a day (the equivalent of what their child, 8-12 years of age, earned after dropping out of school to work to provide basic sustenance to his or her family) for each day that the child returned to school instead of working. Many of these students have now graduated from colleges and polytechnics, including engineering and dental colleges. The trust also coordinates volunteer and subsidized nurses and doctors to assist in health and hygiene issues and assists slum dwellers in getting micro-financing to assist them in setting up their own small businesses. Public sanitation facilities (latrines) were also built and are maintained. HRD tools used included community assessment and feedback, action planning, collaborative decision making, and evaluation to provide continuous improvement.</p>

<sec id="section15-1523422312446147">
<title>General Societal Development Issues</title>
<p>In addition to these case studies, specific societal concerns using HRD approaches appear in the literature. As in the earlier sections, articles are referenced only if one or more of the coauthors were involved in the research.</p>
<sec id="section16-1523422312446147">
<title>Child labor</title>
<p>No one would argue that child labor is ultimately desirable. The problem, however, is figuring out how to reduce and, ultimately, eliminate it. Many have argued for sanctions against countries that allow child labor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312446147">Budhwani, Wee, and McLean (2004)</xref>, however, recognizing that most children who work need to do so to sustain their families, suggested, instead, that a proactive response is better than a reactive response. Thus they suggested that employers of children be required to provide them with reasonable work hours; education, recreation, a safe environment, and healthy nutrition at the workplace; and medical insurance. The approach described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312446147">Shariff and McLean (in press)</xref>, as described above, is another proactive approach that can be used to address this issue. Focusing on improving organizational culture and environment is consistent with outcomes associated with HRD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1523422312446147">
<title>Corruption</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312446147">Chat-uthai and McLean (2003)</xref> explored how HRD has been used and could be used more extensively to combat corruption in Thailand. News stories accusing the top leadership of the country with corruption have suggested that the problem of corruption is a significant problem in Thailand. A similar issue, situated in Korea, was explored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422312446147">Moon and McLean (2003)</xref>. These two countries have a high level of corruption; nevertheless, every country has some level of corruption, so their inclusion here does not suggest that others are corruption-free. Both articles suggested a number of HRD interventions that could be applied to reduce the level of corruption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1523422312446147">
<title>Commercial sex trade</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312446147">Kuo, Yamnill, and McLean (2008)</xref> investigated efforts that had been undertaken in Taiwan and Thailand to provide alternatives to those who had, voluntarily and involuntarily, entered the commercial sex trade. Many efforts have been undertaken in terms of providing training for alternative employment and providing subsidies for those willing to leave the trade. The authors were surprised to discover that few of those employed in the trade were willing to leave it for other employment, primarily because of the huge pay differentials between those in the trade and the occupational options available to those who were often limited in education and who were often illiterate. Criminalization of the trade has, historically, proven to have little impact on discouraging the trade, from either a supply or demand perspective. Evaluation of the change processes and training offered is consistent with HRD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1523422312446147">
<title>HIV/AIDS</title>
<p>There is hardly a country that is not confronted with the significant impact on its population of HIV/AIDS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422312446147">Virakul and McLean (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312446147">2010)</xref> were interested in determining the impact of government and nongovernmental organization programs in Thailand on the implementation of training and human resource practices in business and industry. In spite of these programs and government policies, both in the initial study and in the follow-up study found that there were still companies violating policies around blood testing and privacy. Nevertheless, the follow-up study did find that there was greater application of both training and the following of government policies in the follow-up study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1523422312446147">
<title>Corporate social responsibility (CSR)</title>
<p>Whether CSR is truly for the benefit of a community or whether it serves indirect marketing and public relations functions is still controversial. Nevertheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312446147">Virakul, Koonmee, and McLean (2009)</xref> explored four cases of companies recognized in Thailand as outstanding for their CSR activities. Each company presented itself as being involved in CSR solely for the purpose of improving communities. Common HRD processes used by the companies included collaboration and team building, needs assessment, and action planning. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312446147">Khan and Budhwani (2011)</xref> explored CSR efforts of the Aga Khan Development Network in Pakistan’s micro-finance sector and highlighted the role of training and development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1523422312446147">
<title>National human capital assessment</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422312446147">Verkhohlyad and McLean (2011)</xref> applied a process of considering factors that contribute to a country’s human capital by comparing the human capital index of Ukraine with other countries. Three broad categories of factors affecting a country’s human capital included in the analysis were character qualities, national identity awareness, and the most widespread background/status of families in the country. Based on these factors, all of which are related to the country’s society, Ukraine was rated near the bottom of all countries.</p>
<p>All articles underscored the responsibility that HRD has as the conscience of society by raising questions of corporations, governments, NGOs, and individuals. However, establishing an ethical framework, modeling such ethics, and influencing others to be more ethical are all difficult, especially when core systems continue to support an environment of corruption and unethical behavior. Using motivational theories, good HRD will encourage rewards for ethical behavior with no tolerance for unethical behavior. As with all HRD work, caution must be exercised in avoiding assumptions about ethical behavior outside of the HRD consultant’s experiences.</p>

<sec id="section22-1523422312446147">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>As with all case study research, caution is necessary in drawing implications for practice. Nevertheless, the set of case studies in this article do suggest consideration, at least, for some practices.</p>
<p>First, it is obvious from this article, and the other articles in this issue, that HRD is increasingly being used to address societal development issues, whether intentionally or incidentally. The existing emphasis on the corporate world in HRD preparation programs may not be sufficient for preparing people for this broader scope of HRD. It may even be of value to create a curriculum or courses that focus on some of the broader foci for HRD practice. Furthermore, given the incidental nature of much HRD in societal development, it would be helpful to include some curriculum focus in HRD in disciplines that are not typically prepared with HRD tools and principles but are likely to have an impact in societal development, especially community development, sociology, and applied anthropology.</p>
<p>Many of the case studies in this article, not surprisingly, used the action research model. While this is a typical part of most HRD programs, especially in organization development courses, it is not necessarily included in the professional preparation of professionals in other fields. Action research could easily be built into core courses of other fields.</p>
<p>Each of these case studies either served as an evaluation of a project or incorporated aspects of evaluation in them. Evaluation, however, is not necessarily included in HRD preparatory programs as a core course. Given its importance, and the potential difficulty of conducting evaluation, it might be helpful to require such a course in the preparation of HRD professionals.</p>
<p>Given that many of these projects will never show up in the literature, establishing a center or at least an office, perhaps through the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) as a repository for reports from such project would be very helpful. In addition, such a center might be able to connect individuals working together in such projects Perhaps social media might even be used to connect people so successes and failures can be shared as a process for learning about what others have been doing.</p>

<title>Recommendations for Future Research</title>
<p>Because this article is not based on an extensive literature review, one of the first recommendations is that an extensive literature review be conducted. Such a review should not be limited to HRD literature but should cover a broad range of interdisciplinary literature with a broader focus on HRD. As is obvious from even the few cases presented here, much societal and community development, while using HRD theories, principles, and practices, is performed by people who have backgrounds in many fields.</p>
<p>Both qualitative and quantitative research should be conducted and past studies more carefully analyzed to understand various aspects of societal and community development processes.</p>
<p>In this article, several case studies were conducted in Muslim and Buddhist contexts. It would appear that there would be value in conducting case studies in other faith-based communities. Intolerance and misunderstandings about various belief systems highlight the need to understand developmental issues within faith-based settings. Extending HRD research to other faith-based settings may broaden the horizon of the HRD phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422312446147">Budhwani, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Action research is an obvious approach to exploring the application of HRD in societal development projects. It is probable that hundreds of such projects are currently underway, but they seldom make it into the literature. Practitioners, in particular, need to be encouraged to describe their experiences and submit them for publication in HRD journals and present them in HRD and interdisciplinary conferences. Such articles will serve as models for how HRD can be used for societal development and permit comparison among different approaches.</p>
<p>Another useful research project would be a cross-cultural case comparison. What works in some cultures but not in others? What practices can be transferred from one country or culture to another? Given the desire to contribute to societal development globally, it is important that we begin to understand in societal and community development how cultural values and belief systems impact practices, just as we continue to emphasize their roles in business development. Also within this context lies the need to understand gender roles and how they influence and are influenced by HRD efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422312446147">Budhwani, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, little is currently known about the competencies that should be developed for those active in using HRD for societal and community development. Research to identify such competencies, based on the experiences of successful HRD practitioners who have used their expertise in societal development, would also be a very useful and could serve as the basis of a curriculum to prepare HRD professionals to function in societal development contexts, given that current curricula are primarily focused on corporate application. Several generic competency lists have been developed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422312446147">McLagan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422312446147">Worley, Rothwell, &amp; Sullivan, 2005</xref>); this recommendation would require that a similar list designed specifically for societal development be created.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The case studies presented in this article have described a wide range of contexts and outcomes in which HRD has contributed to societal development. These, along with the articles in this issue of <italic>ADHR</italic>, comprise a beginning that could enable the field to continue to build for the essential mission of helping to improve the well-being of all of humanity.</p>
<p>One of McLean’s strong recollections from a high school literature class was reading Browning’s <italic>Andrea del Sarto</italic> and memorizing “A man’s reach should exceed his grasp, else what’s a heaven for?” HRD as a profession needs to continue to set its sights high and realize that we can have an impact on our world and improve the living conditions for everyone, not just corporations and those who are fortunate enough to be employed. We may not fully meet our ideals, but we will improve humanity!</p>
