<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Twenty-four patients with irreparable lateral meniscal tears (n = 7) or previous partial lateral meniscectomy (n = 17) underwent arthroscopic lateral collagen meniscus implantation. Clinical evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months, and at a minimum 2-year follow-up with Lysholm, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, Tegner, objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) scores. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation was performed preoperatively and at final follow-up using the modified Yulish score for cartilage and the Genovese score for implant size and signal intensity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512456835">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>All clinical scores significantly improved from preoperative evaluation to final follow-up. Average Lysholm scores improved from 64.0 ± 16.2 to 92.7 ± 13.8 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), VAS for pain from 55.2 ± 29.4 to 19.5 ± 25.6 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), Tegner from 3 (interquartile range, 2-4) to 5 (interquartile range, 4-7) (<italic>P</italic> = .0062), objective IKDC from 6A, 14B, 4C to 20A, 3B, 1D (<italic>P</italic> = .0002), and EQ-5D from 0.58 ± 0.28 to 0.89 ± 0.14 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Good to excellent (A + B) objective IKDC scores improved from 83% preoperatively to 96% at 2-year follow-up. The Tegner index (the percentage of the lost activity level that was regained as a result of the treatment intervention) was 47% at 6-month follow-up and 79% at 2-year follow-up: this improvement was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .0062). The MRI evaluations for tibial and femoral modified Yulish scores for cartilage remained similar over the course of the study; 87.5% of implants were reduced in size, and in 3 cases (12.5%), they were completely resorbed; 50% of the implants had a slightly hyperintense signal (relative to the normal meniscus), and signal intensity changes suggested that full maturation had occurred in 37.5% at final follow-up (based on the Genovese scores).</p>

<body>
<p>The menisci are critical to knee joint health, and loss of meniscal tissue leads to decreased clinical function and activity levels. Preserving as much of the meniscus as possible may be critical to avoid or at least minimize degenerative joint progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512456835">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Collagen Meniscus Implant (CMI, Ivy Sports Medicine, Montvale, New Jersey) is a meniscal scaffold made of collagen type I fibers (purified from bovine Achilles tendon) that has successfully replaced partial loss of medial meniscal tissue in humans. Several studies have shown appropriate safety and early to midterm good clinical results using this scaffold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512456835">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512456835">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512456835">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512456835"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512456835"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512456835">28</xref></sup> Recently, Zaffagnini et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512456835">35</xref></sup> documented improvements in pain relief, activity level, general health, and radiological outcomes with the use of a medial CMI at a minimum 10-year follow-up compared with partial medial meniscectomy.</p>
<p>After the encouraging results of the medial CMI, a lateral CMI has been designed to fill partial defects of the lateral meniscus. So far, only a case report has shown improved knee function and reduced pain in a symptomatic laterally meniscectomized young athlete at 36-month follow-up using this lateral meniscal scaffold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512456835">34</xref></sup> However, the efficacy of this new device has not been proven in a clinical follow-up study.</p>
<p>The purpose of this prospective trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the lateral CMI in substituting and filling partial lateral meniscal defects. The hypothesis of the present study was that the lateral CMI would show improvement in clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes at a minimum 2-year follow-up.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Between April 2006 and September 2009, a total of 25 consecutive patients with partial lateral meniscal injuries considered eligible for lateral collagen meniscus implantation were enrolled in this study. Patients were asked to join the study after a previous evaluation by 1 of the 3 senior surgeons, but they were enrolled into the study only after screening performed 2 weeks before surgery. All these patients made up the Italian group of the Lateral CMI European Multicenter Prospective Study.</p>
<p>More specifically, inclusion criteria were identified as (1) irreparable acute lateral meniscal tears requiring partial meniscectomy (acute pattern) or prior traumatic or degenerative loss of lateral meniscal tissue (chronic pattern) greater than 25%, (2) intact anterior and posterior horn attachments of the lateral meniscus, (3) intact rim (1 mm or greater) over the entire circumference of the involved meniscus (a deficient popliteal hiatus was allowed because, in this place, the native meniscal rim has low vascularization and consequently low healing power), (4) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiencies stabilized at the time of the index surgery, (5) participants between 15 and 60 years of age, and (6) a contralateral healthy knee. Exclusion criteria included (1) concomitant posterior cruciate ligament insufficiency of the involved knee; (2) diagnosis of Outerbridge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512456835">18</xref></sup> grade IV degenerative cartilage disease in the affected joint; (3) uncorrected malformations or axial misalignment in the involved lower extremity greater than 5°; (4) documented allergy to collagen or chondroitin sulfate of animal origin; (5) systemic or local infection; (6) history of anaphylactoid reaction; (7) systemic administration of any type of corticosteroid or immunosuppressive agents within 30 days of surgery; (8) evidence of osteonecrosis in the involved knee; (9) history of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, or autoimmune diseases; (10) neurological abnormalities or conditions that would preclude the patient’s requirements for the rehabilitation program; and (11) pregnancy. These exclusion criteria have been defined for the study purposes, as determined in the European Multicenter Prospective Study. During the study period, all the lateral CMIs implanted at our institutions fulfilled these criteria and were included into the study. All the enrolled patients underwent arthroscopic lateral collagen meniscus implantation, performed by the 3 senior authors (S.Z., P.B., and M.M.) at 2 different hospitals.</p>
<p>All demographic, surgical, and follow-up details are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512456835">Table 1</xref>; previous and concomitant surgical procedures are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512456835">Table 2</xref>. Twenty-four patients (96%) were available for the minimum 2-year follow-up. One patient withdrew from the study because she became pregnant and did not complete the required follow-up MRI. Her data are not included.</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The technique for arthroscopic lateral collagen meniscus implantation is well described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512456835">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512456835">34</xref></sup> Specifically, after a standard diagnostic arthroscopic procedure, the implant site was prepared. In 17 cases, a full-thickness chronic lateral meniscal defect was observed, while in the remaining 7 cases, an irreparable acute flap tear was removed. The anterior and posterior meniscal attachment points were trimmed square to accept the scaffold, and the blood supply was enhanced by making puncture holes in the peripheral rim with a Steadman awl. The size of the defect was then determined with a specially designed measuring device, and the lateral CMI was measured and trimmed to fill the defect. The locations of the lesions were mostly posterior and central. After the implant was inserted into the defect, it was sutured to the host meniscus remnant with “all-inside” stitches (nonabsorbable ULTRABRAID No. 0 wire and poly-L-lactide bioabsorbable ULTRA FAST-FIX implants, Smith &amp; Nephew, Andover, Massachusetts).</p>
<p>Vertical stitches were placed about every 5 mm, except for anterior and posterior scaffold extremities (fixed to the native meniscus remnant with horizontal stitches) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512456835">Figure 1</xref>). Final scaffold stability was tested with a probe upon completion of suturing.</p>

<title>Rehabilitation Protocol</title>
<p>A knee brace was applied and locked in full extension immediately after surgery, and the patient wore it for 6 weeks; it was removed 4 times per day to allow continuous passive motion (CPM). When a CPM range from 0° to 60° was achieved, CPM was increased to 90° of flexion after 2 weeks, and after 2 more weeks, complete passive motion was allowed. During the first 2 weeks, weightbearing was not allowed; ambulation was permitted only using crutches. After 2 weeks, progressive weightbearing was started, and patients usually used 1 crutch for the first period (on the basis of evidence derived from basic science and preclinical studies).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512456835">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512456835">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512456835">27</xref></sup> Muscle strengthening started on the second postoperative day with isometric exercises. Cycling was allowed the second postoperative week. Elastic resistance and isotonic strengthening programs were started the fourth postoperative week. All patients followed a rehabilitation protocol for 6 months until they returned to full unrestricted activity as tolerated.</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546512456835">
<title>Follow-up Evaluation</title>
<p>All patients were clinically evaluated preoperatively, at 6 months after surgery, and at a minimum 2-year follow-up by 2 independent orthopaedic surgeons, who were blinded to preoperative patient status and who did not take part in the surgery. Every complication related to the device and any reinterventions were recorded during the follow-up period.</p>

<p>All patients underwent bilateral anteroposterior weightbearing, long standing radiography, and lateral view radiography in 30° of flexion of the involved knee to evaluate the leg alignment. Preoperative MRI was performed to assess cartilage status. An MRI evaluation was also executed at the final follow-up in all study patients. All MRI scans were performed with a 1.5-T unit using the same sequences (gradient echo T2, spin echo T1, fat-saturated fast spin echo proton density, and T2-weighted) and techniques. Preoperative MRI scans were collected from patients and stored into the PACS system (Kodak DirectView, Rochester, New York) at our institute. A single expert radiologist (M.B.) retrospectively examined all MRI scans (preoperative and postoperative images) in a blinded fashion, evaluating articular cartilage alterations between time points using the Yulish score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512456835">32</xref></sup> Slight modifications of this score were performed as done by Verdonk et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512456835">31</xref></sup> introducing intermediate scoring for lesions between 2 different grades (eg, a lesion between grades 1 and 2 was given a nominative value of 1.5). Morphology and intensity of the signal of the lateral CMIs were evaluated using the Genovese score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512456835">7</xref></sup> This score includes 3 grade patterns classified from 1 to 3, with higher scores reflecting patterns more closely resembling those of the normal meniscus. For morphological evaluation, the CMI/residual meniscus complex was classified as grade 1 if the CMI was totally resorbed, as grade 2 when the complex appeared small with a regular or irregular shape, and as grade 3 when the shape and size were essentially identical to a normal meniscus. For signal intensity, a markedly hyperintense CMI was scored as grade 1, a slightly hyperintense CMI was grade 2, and an isointense signal compared with the normal meniscus CMI (no signal) was grade 3.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The statistical analysis was performed using Analyse-it 2.00 (Analyse-it Software Ltd, Leeds, United Kingdom). A priori sample size definition was prospectively estimated for a paired Student <italic>t</italic> test with a power of 90%, starting from the hypothesis of a preoperative VAS value of 60 ± 20 and final follow-up value of 12 ± 9 (referring to Zaffagnini et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512456835">35</xref></sup>). Considering a high dropout rate in the long term (about 40%), 25 patients were enrolled in this study.</p>
<p>Statistical comparison between the preoperative and follow-up parametric scores was performed using the Student <italic>t</italic> test. The population study was tested for normal distribution before the <italic>t</italic> test was applied. For differences between time points in Tegner level and MRI modified Yulish score, the nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used. For differences in the objective IKDC form, the Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> test was utilized. Comparison between groups based on acute/chronic pattern was performed using the Student <italic>t</italic> test. Correlations between the body mass index (BMI), time from first meniscectomy, modified Yulish score, Genovese score, and clinical outcomes were analyzed by the Spearman ρ test. The level of significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation for parametric values and median (interquartile range [IQR]) for nonparametric values.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The evaluation performed showed a statistically significant improvement of all the clinical outcomes scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546512456835">Table 3</xref>). For the Lysholm score, we found a significant increase from baseline to the 6-month follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and from baseline to the minimum 2-year follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). At final follow-up, Lysholm scores were graded as excellent or good in 87% of study patients. The pain score decreased significantly from baseline to 6-month follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and remained almost unchanged at 2-year follow-up (reduced significantly compared with baseline, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Although the Tegner activity level at the final follow-up was 5 (IQR, 4-7) and did not reach the preinjury median value of 7 (IQR, 5-7), it was significantly improved at the final follow-up compared with the preoperative status of 3 (IQR, 2-4) (<italic>P</italic> = .0062). This score improvement started 6 months after the surgery (<italic>P</italic> = .0012) and was maintained. The Tegner index (the percentage of the lost activity level that was regained as a result of the treatment intervention) was 47% at 6-month follow-up and 79% at 2-year follow-up: this improvement was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .0062). The objective IKDC score significantly improved from preoperatively to 6-month follow-up, and it remained stable until the 2-year follow-up (<italic>P</italic> = .0002). Finally, the EQ-5D score was significantly improved (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) from preoperative status to the final follow-up. Four patients (17%) presented a deficient popliteal hiatus; they were all patients with chronic injuries, and this did not affect reported outcomes (mean Lysholm score at final follow-up was 92.0 ± 6.5).</p>

No significant differences for clinical and radiological scores were found at 2-year follow-up between the groups of lateral CMI alone and lateral CMI with concomitant procedures.

<p>No complications related to the device were reported during the follow-up period.

<sec id="section14-0363546512456835" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The most important finding of this study was the ability of the lateral CMI to improve knee function and decrease knee pain in 96% of patients with irreparable lateral meniscal lesions or symptomatic abnormalities after partial lateral meniscectomy at minimum 2-year follow-up. The procedure was also safe because no device-related complications were noted.</p>
<p>Current concepts of meniscal surgery suggest preservation, suture repair, or replacement of the meniscus. In fact, it has been shown that a larger meniscectomy results in a greater decrease of the contact area, which in turn leads to increasing the mean and peak contact stresses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512456835">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, these forces increase about 200% more after a lateral versus a medial meniscectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512456835">19</xref></sup> The effects of such biomechanical changes are well documented and are presumed to lead to an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis, estimated to be about 20% for the medial meniscus and 40% for the lateral meniscus 10 years after a meniscectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512456835">5</xref></sup> With this background, the CMI was developed to prevent or at least minimize the degenerative effects of a partial meniscectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512456835">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512456835">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512456835">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512456835">28</xref></sup> Rodkey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512456835">21</xref></sup> showed the superiority of collagen meniscus implantation compared with meniscectomy at 5-year follow-up for the treatment of symptomatic chronic medial meniscus deficiencies in a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial. A few years later, Zaffagnini et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512456835">35</xref></sup> found better clinical and radiological results of the medial CMI compared with partial medial meniscectomy at a minimum 10-year follow-up in a prospective case series study. Other studies reported good results after medial collagen meniscus implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512456835">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study is the first to report outcomes of use of the lateral CMI in a group of patients. The only other work that describes use of the lateral CMI available in the literature is a case report of a soccer player evaluated at 3-year follow-up that relates good results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512456835">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The lack of studies of the lateral CMI does not allow the results of this study to be compared with similar case series. Therefore, with full awareness of the anatomic and biomechanical differences between medial and lateral menisci,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512456835">16</xref></sup> the findings reported in this study are compared with the existing literature involving the medial CMI and allograft meniscus transplantation to evaluate the effects and any potential differences of the lateral CMI.</p>
<p>Improvement of Lysholm, objective IKDC, and VAS for pain scores was found at the 6-month follow-up evaluation. Those scores remained almost unchanged until the 2-year follow-up evaluation, highlighting the stable results achieved by the lateral CMI. For the Tegner Activity Scale, although the score was increased by the 6-month follow-up, a significant improvement was reported only at the final follow-up. This finding could be explained in part by the long rehabilitation protocol followed after collagen meniscus implantation that limited the sport activity for several months after surgery. Despite this improvement, the activity level did not reach the preinjury level. This finding might be explained by the relatively short-term follow-up and the high number of chronic patients included in the present study (78%). Several authors reported similar outcomes for the medial CMI at 2-year follow-up, thus suggesting an analogous behavior of both lateral and medial partial meniscal substitutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512456835">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512456835">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512456835">22</xref></sup> Also, similar results have been shown after medial and lateral meniscus transplantations for clinical and radiological outcomes at short-term follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512456835">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512456835">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512456835">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>We are aware of only 1 study that described medial CMI morphological characteristics and signal intensity with MRI at 2-year follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512456835">7</xref></sup> The authors reported 56% of CMIs were of normal size, 38% were smaller, and 6% were reabsorbed. These findings were different from what was reported at 6- and 12-month follow-up, highlighting a progressive reduction in size. This finding was confirmed by second-look arthroscopy and was attributed to implant height reduction caused by compressive forces acting on the knee during motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512456835">7</xref></sup> Moreover, Reguzzoni et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512456835">20</xref></sup> showed a compressed medial CMI 6 months after implantation by means of scanning electron microscopy analysis. The size of the scaffold seems to further decrease at long-term follow-up, as reported by Monllau et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512456835">17</xref></sup> who showed 89% of CMIs were decreased in size, and no CMI was of normal size at minimum 10-year follow-up. In the current literature, no study reported mean CMI volume using MRI. Rodkey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512456835">21</xref></sup> measured the volume of meniscal tissue 1 year after collagen meniscus implantation by means of second-look arthroscopy. As we did not perform second-look arthroscopy, we believe that the better alternative way to assess CMI volume with MRI is the Genovese score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512456835">7</xref></sup> A reduction in lateral CMI size was found by MRI in the present study at 2-year follow-up, when only 12.5% of scaffolds presented a normal size. The higher percentage of the “reduced in size” lateral CMI, compared with that reported by Genovese et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512456835">7</xref></sup> for the medial CMI, might be explained by the different anatomic conditions of the lateral knee compartment compared with those of the medial side. Further studies at longer follow-up will tell us if the scaffold will continue to shrink or if these findings reflect a faster achievement of a reduced size that tend to be stable over time.</p>
<p>Regarding the MRI signal intensity of the implant, studies reported a progressive decrease of the initial hyperintense signal toward an isointense signal compared with the normal meniscus, thus suggesting an ongoing maturation process. At 2-year follow-up, the medial CMI was reported to present a signal that is isointense with the normal meniscus in 27% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512456835">7</xref></sup> Monllau et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512456835">17</xref></sup> reported maturation of the implant and normalization of the signal from 10% at 1 year to 21% at the 10-year follow-up. The results reported in the present study do not differ from what has been reported for the medial CMI, as the percentage of lateral CMIs with normal signal intensity at the 2-year follow-up is 37.5%. The interpretation of these results remains controversial because of the operator-dependent score used to evaluate this parameter and the lack of arthroscopic or other visual evaluation.</p>
<p>A chondroprotective effect on articular cartilage is suggested but still is not proven for the CMI. At 1-year follow-up, Rodkey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512456835">21</xref></sup> showed a small improvement of the Outerbridge grade during second-look arthroscopy, while at a mean 5.8-year follow-up, Steadman and Rodkey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512456835">25</xref></sup> found only 20% of patients had deterioration of only 1 grade on the Outerbridge scale. Nevertheless, encouraging results of cartilage status are reported long term with MRI investigation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512456835">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512456835">35</xref></sup> Outerbridge IV cartilage defects were excluded from the present study, and the grading of cartilage status to determine collagen meniscus implantation was assessed arthroscopically and not using MRI, as discrepancies between arthroscopic and MRI findings are well known.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512456835">24</xref></sup> In this research, no changes or slight improvement of cartilage status were reported in most patients at the 2-year follow-up MRI evaluation. This finding might be explained by the filling effect of the scaffold that is estimated to be about 69% of the meniscal defect at 5.8 years after medial collagen meniscus implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512456835">25</xref></sup> The long time since first meniscectomy could be responsible for the progression of cartilage degeneration that took place in a subset of patients, even after lateral collagen meniscus implantation. In these patients, irreversible degenerative changes could have already taken place, even if no correlation was found between cartilage status, clinical outcomes, and time since first meniscectomy. Although no biomechanical studies on CMI meniscal substitution have been performed, we speculate that the increased surface area coverage from the newly formed tissue might decrease the deleterious stress on the articular cartilage and reduce wear on the chondral surfaces as documented for meniscal allografts or other scaffolds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512456835">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512456835">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The length of the implant correlated with the time since the first partial lateral meniscectomy. This correlation may be because of less conservative and more aggressive meniscectomy techniques used in the past and the greater likelihood to undergo another meniscectomy for patients who received the first meniscal surgery earlier in the past.</p>
<p>The present study has several limitations. The most important weakness was the lack of a concurrent control group of patients undergoing only a partial lateral meniscectomy. We followed the Lateral CMI European Multicenter Trial protocol; hence, there was no cohort of control patients because the original purpose of the multicenter study was to show primarily the safety and secondarily the efficacy of the lateral CMI. However, our results showed that the procedure is safe and yields pain relief and functional improvement in 96% of patients at the minimum 2-year follow-up (similarly to that reported by Verdonk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512456835">30</xref></sup> in their survivorship analysis on lateral meniscus transplantation).</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study is the short follow-up (minimum, 24 months; mean, 26 ± 2.2 months) and the high number of concurrent procedures, thus making it difficult to evaluate the real benefit of the scaffold. However, this study is the first clinical case series report to describe outcomes for the lateral CMI. A concurrent ACL reconstruction procedure was carried out in 4 patients, but as previously reported by Rodkey et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512456835">21</xref></sup> this procedure appears to have no influence on the amount of new tissue growth. Furthermore, Monllau et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512456835">17</xref></sup> also reported a comparable number of ACL reconstructions and similar outcomes for medial CMIs.</p>
<p>Finally, the chondral surfaces were evaluated by means of MRI using the modified Yulish score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512456835">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512456835">32</xref></sup> without a second-look biopsy. This system was developed for chondromalacia patellae, but recently, Verdonk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512456835">31</xref></sup> used it to classify femoral and tibial cartilage degeneration after meniscus allograft transplantation. The modified Yulish score was employed for the evaluation of cartilage status for study proposal, as MRI was easier to obtain rather than second-look arthroscopy at final follow-up because of ethical and practical issues. This score is reader dependent; therefore, the results must be considered with caution.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The lateral CMI was demonstrated to be safe in this population study, resulting in decreased pain and improved knee function in 96% of patients with excellent/good Lysholm results in 87% of patients at a minimum 2-year follow-up. The MRI scans demonstrated a decreased implant size relative to a normal meniscus.</p>
