<abstract>
<p>Gathering metaphors of holistic nurses provides for an exploration of how that metaphor is captured in real-life experiences. Metaphors are a way of describing an experience or a perceived notion as a personal expression of thought. The metaphoric understanding of what practicing as a holistic nurse means is discussed with reference to the personal, emotional, and spiritual component of being a holistic nurse. Capturing the superfluity and vividness of these beautiful expressions embedded in participants’ metaphors produced insight and a deeper apprehension of the connectedness in nursing. This study used a qualitative exploratory approach to collect data from 75 holistic nurses. Data were collected using participants’ own expression of the metaphor of holistic nursing and correlating critical incident reports of how that metaphor was expressed in practice. Metaphors were not analyzed but correlated by themes. The critical incident reports were analyzed to uncover and isolate key aspects of commonalities. The results capture the abundance and diversity of metaphorical expressions embedded in participants’ metaphors produced insight and a deeper appreciation of the connectedness in nursing.</p>

<body>
<p>This article evolved from previous research on holistic nurses’ metaphorical expression of their participation in the healing-caring process of self and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112461948">Sharoff, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010112461948">2008b</xref>). The original two studies incorporated asking participants to describe their practice as a holistic nurse in a metaphor. This aspect was an additional data source and was not considered the primary feature of either study. Returning to the metaphorical expression as the principal source of data collection was the focus of this current research, as it seemed an extremely worthwhile undertaking likely to produce additional insights and a richer vision of what it means to be a holistic nurse. One of the striking features that emerged from all of these studies was the abundance and diversity of metaphorical expressions by participants. Capturing the superfluity and vividness of these beautiful artistic parables embedded in participants’ metaphors produced insight and a deeper appreciation of the connectedness that is holistic nursing.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to describe holistic nurses’ practice as a metaphor. Participants were asked to describe their practice as a metaphor and provide an example where they perceived their metaphor to be expressed in an event and/or experience. By exploring such a personal expression of self and practice, the researcher hoped to gain a deeper understanding of the holistic nurse, thus enhancing not only the profession as a whole but also the interactions and interconnectedness of holistic nurses and their participation in the healing-caring process of self and others. This article will expound the seven superordinate themes that were identified.</p>
<sec id="section1-0898010112461948">
<title>Background</title>
<p>How may a focus on metaphor contribute to the understanding of participants’ experience and its meaning to each participant as it relates to being a holistic nurse? The use of metaphors offers insight into their practice and experience as holistic nurses. Metaphors determine not only the way we conceptualize things but also what skills, knowledge and attitudes we develop to deal with these things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112461948">Ardichvili, 2001</xref>). They provide a linguistic form for our experiences, for conceptualizing our lives and professional ways of being, by providing a vivid comparison that expresses these constructs. Metaphors are a creative emblematic description in which characters and events are being shared and understood as representing other concepts, symbolically expressing a deeper, often more meaningful, spiritual, and personal meaning. They are “literary comparisons that are used to create new meaning and insight into concepts, ideas and situations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112461948">Milton, 2009</xref>, p. 318). As a researcher, the inclusion of metaphors was a way of incorporating creativity and personal expression into this study. It is another form of original data that provided an outlet for experience and individualization to formulate into one singular component of expressive self. “Exploring nursing metaphors can provide opportunities to develop new understandings of nursing and challenge metaphorical images that may be constraining and/or obscuring significant elements of holistic nursing practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112461948">Hartrick &amp; Schreiber, 1998</xref>, p. 420).</p>
<p>Metaphors can be a powerful naturalistic format for generating meaning of being a nurse. Making meaning, creatively thinking, reasoning, and analyzing our actions are all paramount to the continued exploration of self and essential for continued personal and professional growth and development. Metaphors “create new meaning and provide deeper insight in the human spirit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112461948">Sharoff, 2007</xref>, p. 14). They are a personal representation of self as well as a vivid, expressive everyday dialogical format. It is through this experience and reflection that a nurse can creatively express his or her images of self and nursing. “Using metaphoric expressions open up possibilities for richly textured communication,” by conveying “visual and tactual imagery that adds a more vivid level of understanding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112461948">Shinebourne &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>, p. 60).</p>
<p>Examination of metaphoric language of nurses offers an opportunity to examine, understand and explore nurses’ work. How we “conceptualize one domain in terms of another” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112461948">Lakoff, 1992</xref>, p. 203), by providing allegorical vision and linguistic artistic imagery of symbolic expression of a deeper meaning through storytelling further exemplifies the creative nature of holistic nurses. “Metaphors and everyday experience creates a process of reflexive thinking for multiple ways of knowing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010112461948">Barton, 2004</xref>, p. 519). Reflective thinking requires individuals to explore their assumptions and biases, to contemplate their own participation in the healing-caring process of self and others. The construction of multiple ways of being is an ever-evolving dynamic transformative process. Artistic metaphorical creativity further espouses the progressive nature that is the holistic nurse. Holistic nurses are a unique group who weave a tapestry of the bio-psycho-social-cultural-spiritual elements to assist in the healing-caring process of self and others. Holistic nurses recognize and integrate the body-mind-emotion-spirit-environment-cultural principles and modalities in daily life and clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112461948">Mariano, 2009</xref>). The self-reflective process of being a holistic nurse is essential to the continued communication and development between personal and professional ways of being. It is through this process that metaphors can provide a literary as well as visual argot. Identifying metaphors can<disp-quote>
<p>provide nurses with a better understanding of their skills, knowledge and attitudes, and how to incorporate those characteristics and behaviors into their lives and practice to further enhance themselves and others, as well as provide for an opportunity to express their thoughts and feelings in a creative way. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112461948">Sharoff, 2007</xref>, p. 17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There have been many metaphorical studies on nurses and nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112461948">Engebretson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112461948">Froggart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112461948">Gokenbach, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112461948">Goodman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112461948">Hartrick &amp; Schreiber, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112461948">Milton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010112461948">Rose, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112461948">Sharoff, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010112461948">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010112461948">Wurzbach, 1999</xref>). These studies have shown how metaphors have historically revealed the nurses’ perception of their reality at that moment in time. Elucidating the meanings of nurses’ experiences through metaphor provides an avenue to better understand the true dynamics of being a nurse.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0898010112461948">
<title>Design</title>
<p>Holistic nurses were invited to share an understanding of their world through a metaphor of how they perceived their practice and then share an experience whereby they felt their metaphor was portrayed. The inclusion criterion required only that participants be a member of American Holistic Nurses’ Association (AHNA). There was no monetary gift for participation, and participants were purposely chosen to include a geographically and ethnically diverse sample of men and women, recognizing that the majority of AHNA’s members are Caucasian and female. Institutional review board approval was obtained. Interrater reliability was maintained with assistance from an experienced nurse researcher. Study data were collected from 2007 to 2009.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to glean metaphors of holistic nurses. To that end, all participants were requested to write down their metaphors (with a title) and provide a brief explanation of their metaphor. In addition, all participants were asked to write down a critical incident report describing their metaphor. They were asked to think of an important event/experience in their practice where they felt that their metaphor as a holistic nurse was expressed. They were asked to reflect on how this experience affected them as a holistic nurse and how it permeated with the essence of their metaphor. This form of qualitative naturalistic inquiry, the critical incident technique (CIT), was used to provide participants with a unique opportunity to share their behaviors in clear and concise descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112461948">Flanagan, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112461948">Kemppainen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112461948">Redfern &amp; Norman, 1999</xref>) The CIT is an effective naturalistic qualitative methodology for focusing participants on a specific event or experience. It provides “versatility and flexibility” and “enables the researcher to capture the reality of contemporary nursing practice, and nurses’ experiences of that practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112461948">Keatinge, 2002</xref>, p. 33). The critical incident was used as to obtain a real-life experience that assisted the researcher in furthering the understanding of participant’s metaphor. It is a form of storytelling, as the participant is sharing his or her singular experience as a story while ensuring that all participants focus on the same issues, given the general aim of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010112461948">Sharoff, 2008a</xref>). However, using the CIT requires participants’ memory of events and experiences, which are typically “faithfully recalled, although there is no guarantee” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010112461948">Urquhart et al., 2003</xref>, p. 71). In other words, researchers will not know if the “event and/or experience” has some fabrication or colorful additional elements to it. Using the same CIT language establishes a more critical perspective when discussing metaphors in the context of the discourse of holistic nursing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898010112461948">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The researcher, being a member of AHNA, had access to other AHNA members’ e-mails. The purposive list of holistic nurses started with the researcher’s own members’ listing. In addition, word of mouth by participants, a notice for publication in the AHNA’s newsletter <italic>Beginnings</italic> to request volunteers, and a flyer that was provided for distribution at the 2007 AHNA National Annual Convention were the only other formats for this purposeful sampling. The researcher sent an introductory e-mail to all eligible participants to request participation. Signed consent forms were obtained via regular mail service, and data collection occurred via e-mail correspondence. Once a participant agreed to participate, a confidential numerical code was written on the upper right corner of the two consent forms that were mailed. The participant was asked to sign both and return one in the self-addressed stamped envelop back to the researcher. Once the researcher started to receive e-mail data, the same numerical code was used to save the data on a separate flash drive that was used only for this study. Only the researcher had access to all the data, which were coded with the same numerical code for each participant. Confidentiality and anonymity were maintained throughout the study.</p>
<p>Initially, 86 holistic nurses agreed to participate. However, even though the researcher received all of the consent forms, 11 individuals did not return any data. The researcher e-mailed those individuals, attaching the instruments again with the introductory e-mail letter. However, there was no response from these individuals. The numerical coded consent forms were placed in a separate confidential file and those numerical codes were not reused. The researcher kept a detailed spreadsheet of when consent forms were mailed out and returned and of when data were returned from participants. This process allowed the researcher to keep an audit trail of all data. If a follow-up e-mail was necessary for a participant who did not return any data for several months, an additional e-mail was forwarded (always with data attachments), asking if the participant wished to remain in the study. Participants’ responses to these additional e-mails were very positive, and researcher always received the data within a few weeks.</p>

<sec id="section5-0898010112461948">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All of the metaphors were placed into similar themes according to the metaphor description (not metaphor title) and were not analyzed. It was not the researcher’s intent to interpret or analyze the metaphors, in view of the fact that metaphors are an individualized expression of personal experience. It was the researcher’s intention to provide a thematic interpretation of the metaphors as a way of further appreciating these unique nurses and their visions of participating in the healing-caring process of self and others. “The interpretation of participants’ narratives allows the researcher to describe what metaphors are espoused by the interviewees but does not allow for an understanding of the reasons for the emergence of these particular metaphors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112461948">Ardichvili, 2001</xref>, p. 136). The metaphors were clustered according to conceptual similarities. These clusters were given a descriptive name that conveys the conceptual nature of the theme. “Attempting to capture the metaphors in the process of their creation and change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112461948">Ardichvili, 2001</xref>, pp. 136) and not analyze the essence of what the metaphor was depicting but to place them into correlating themes based on their titles provided the researcher with the opportunity to not reinterpret these artistic creative expressions but allow them to remain flexible and fluid.</p>
<p>By similar themes, the researcher means metaphorical descriptions, and the critical incident data were coded and analyzed for correlated themes as well. The rich analysis of the CIT data yielded corresponding metaphor themes, though many participants’ CIT data also had more than one common theme; thus, one CIT corresponded to multiple themes. Data were managed in an objective and systematic approach leading to the construction of correlating suppositions. Initially, several clusters were identified and these were eventually collapsed into the seven expounding themes.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Seventy-five holistic nurses took part in this study (though 77 metaphors were obtained as two participants provided two separate metaphors). All participants were female, aged 30 to 87 years (mean = 54.35 years). Caucasian was the primary ethnicity (88.16%), with 3.95% Hispanic/Latina(o) and 2.63% Black/African American. Highest degree obtained was MSN/MS/MA (48.68%), followed by PhD/EdD/Doctorate (23.68%) and BSN/BS/BA (22.37%). Years of nursing experience ranged from 8 to 64 (mean = 28.99 years) and years of holistic nurse experience ranged from 1 to 49 (mean = 16.03). Slightly more than half of the participants were either board-certified advanced holistic nurses (26.32%), whereas 25% were board-certified holistic nurses. Geographically, 30.26% lived on the east coast of the United States, whereas 25% lived either on the west coast or the Midwest.

<title>Caring for Self, Caring for Others</title>
<p>Twenty-two participants’ metaphors described varied aspects of caring for self, caring for others.</p>
<p>One participant, a nurse for more than 16 years, titled her metaphor <italic>Planting Seeds</italic>.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I plant seeds for whole person health . . . with the hope they will germinate, sprout . . . offer individuals . . . more supportive option to choose from their path of self-care. Seeds need love, time, inspiration, motivation, faith and commitment to sprout. Often I describe what I do as helping individuals connect the dots/find or see the connections between mind-body-spirit-environment, their choices . . . their experience of health—a whole person health.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant, a certified advanced holistic hospice nurse, titled her metaphor <italic>Angel at the Bridge.</italic></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Work . . . I do . . . being an angel at the bridge that leads from this world to the next. See my role . . . helping those who are dying become more comfortable with this transition. Sometimes . . . take them to . . . top of the bridge to look over into the next place. Sometimes, we just remain at . . . base of . . . bridge while they get used to . . . idea of having to cross it . . . in . . . future. I do whatever is needed to help them be comfortable in this life, until they are ready to move on towards the next. It is in those moments that I accompany them to the top of the bridge, send them off with a kiss on the forehead, and just bear witness as they continue on to the next place.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A CIT that expressed how nurses care for others was from a participant who titled her metaphor <italic>Sunshine on a Cloudy Day.</italic> A holistic nurse for more than 25 years and a summer camp counselor, she shared her experience with a 13-year-old camper who did not want to attend the mandatory field trip. As she states,<disp-quote>
<p>I intuitively felt there was more to [her] story. I learned that she had had an anxiety attack the weekend before on the field trip and felt claustrophobic on the bus rides. As all the children were on a field trip, I was able to spend time with her that day. I gave her permission to miss the next days’ trip and arranged for a visit with her aunt instead. The next weekend I was amazed she was eager to attend the field trips and no longer felt anxious about going on the bus.</p>
<p>As a holistic nurse, I felt this incident clearly reflected the inter-relationship of body, mind and emotions. Once [she] had permission to feel all she was feeling, the anxiety lessened. Simple therapeutic interventions such as presence, listening, and walking with/being with her allowed her story to unfold and her self-healing abilities to emerge. My role was to bring sunshine (warmth, caring, and presence) into her cloudy day (fear and anxiety). This incident reminds me of the value of presence as the simplest yet most profound holistic intervention.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0898010112461948">
<title>Connectedness, Oneness, Wholeness</title>
<p>Fifteen participants’ metaphors described aspects to the connection we share to self, others, holistic nursing and the universe.</p>
<p>One participants’ metaphor, <italic>Art Quilts</italic>, described how quilts are similar to holistic nursing.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In art quilts, surface design . . . an integral part of the “art” of the quilt . . . can be an exquisite whole cloth quilt, without any adornment . . . or with many types of design . . . embellishments or use of metal. Surface design—the interaction of design, fabric, embellishment, creativity . . . is what makes the individual holistic nurse. Our surface design is expressed in so many ways . . . how we dress, our jewelry, how we talk to other, our laugh . . . our intention to heal, transpersonal caring relationship, our beliefs about nursing, modalities we practice . . . the art of nursing expressed by each holistic nurse. Each of those is a bead, a knot, or other form of embellishment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This participant’s CIT further espoused this same concept about the “‘aesthetics of nursing,” the connectedness we all share. As a hospice nurse, this participant was participating in the care of a dying patient at his home. She, who had visited this family several times, met “Nancy,” a Crisis Care Licensed Vocational Nurse, at the house.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>While . . . patient’s wife was pleasant . . . practical . . . brisk when conversing with others, at least in my presence. As soon as Nancy began speaking, her face just . . . relaxed. And she smiled . . . such warmth in her expression. This transpired fairly quickly, and as I watch (thank goodness I looked up!), I clearly heard in my head, “this is the aesthetics of nursing.” It fell together—the fabric, the stitching, the color, the design. It was all there. The fabric was the context, the stitching was the relationships involved, the color was the tone of the interactions, and the design was Nancy’s presence. But it was my quilt in a very real way—my coming to know. I have been much more conscious of this aspect since that day.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0898010112461948">
<title>Transformation and Awakening</title>
<p>Eleven participants’ metaphors described the cluster of change, transition, and awareness.</p>
<p><italic>The Wet, Wrinkled Table Cover</italic> is the metaphor for this 70-year-old holistic nurse who discussed transformation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In my home, I have a wet wrinkled hand-crocheted table cover. If I leave it impressed, it cannot display its usefulness and beauty. Therefore, I open it out, spray it with starch . . . very carefully iron out the wrinkles. It responds by expanding to it’s truly beauty, round . . . decorated . . . intricate designs. Ironing takes time, requiring some careful positioning of the iron, set at the correct temperature. When all . . . wrinkles have been smoothed, it is completely opened, round, beautiful . . . ready to be used.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant, a nurse with more than 26 years of experience, titled her metaphor <italic>The Magic Mirror</italic>. This metaphor shows how, as nurses, we help in healing.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You come to me looking for healing . . . looking for your highest/healed self. I look into your eyes . . . see your wounds . . . see the whole, healthy, complete soul you are. I gather all the skills I have learned . . . tried and true techniques I can share for your healing journey. As best as I can, I become your Magic Mirror. I step away from my ego and expectation. I become deeply quiet . . . invite the perfect light of healing to show you yourself as you are. This shows you your pain illuminated by healing potential. In that perfect light of healing I become a reflection of your whole/headed self so you can see . . . remember who you really are. Shifting back and forth between . . . actual and . . . potential, providing glimpses of new processes…insights as background to your reflection, the Mirror focuses the light of healing your journey from the present to your goal. Healing is ignited.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One participant, with more than 18 years of nursing experience, titled her metaphor, <italic>Artist</italic>. It is about transformation and change.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Healing . . . as creative an art as fine arts. Don’t literally think of . . . patient as . . . canvas and me as the painter . . . but perhaps . . . patient as . . . clay, moldable, pliable . . . waiting to take form and me as the means to help it take that form.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Her experience in her practice where she felt her metaphor was expressed was when she was taking care of a patient who had a difficult decision to make.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Helping a patient who was extremely difficult to take care of, make the decision to take himself off life support. The transition from physical patient to spiritual presence was accomplished over a huge chasm. True transformation was taking place . . . my role . . . described as “Artist.” The creative process taking place at that moment was palpable. Very real, very memorable. I was completely immersed in guiding the transformation, with the intense energy and thoughtfulness I have felt in the past when working as a fine artist. The parallels between Art and Healing (and therefore true love) have always fascinated me. This experience has stayed with me for years and was probably the reason I am so committed to holistic nursing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0898010112461948">
<title>Awareness, Strength to Discover, Insight</title>
<p>The metaphors clustered in this theme revolved around personal and professional strength, around personal and professional freedom to choose what one wants to be and do. It is a description of the pioneering behavior that helped form what holistic nursing is and will become. Eight metaphors were clustered in this theme.</p>
<p>A beautiful description of this was written by a nurse with more than 45 years of experience. She titled her metaphor <italic>How Is Tugboat Like a Nurse.</italic></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Tugboats . . . vital . . . safe journey . . . known waters or small canals . . . available 24/7 during all types of weather, treacherous tides . . . fluctuations in the water levels . . . assume great responsibility . . . accountability with very little glory or acknowledgement from the members of the precious cargo . . . size of . . . Tugboat . . . miniscule . . . to . . . ships . . . escorted thru the waters. Tugboats accomplish their task with . . . simple commitment . . . gently connect . . . allow . . . larger vessels . . . into . . . state of yielding to . . . wisdom, skill, experience. Tugboats . . . little time to guide . . . larger vessels . . . but alas, Tugboats utilize . . . theory of integrity. Show up, don’t butt the boat, be aware of dangerous waters, toot its’ own horn, step back and be aware of another safe journey with a sense of wonder in a great days work.</p>
<p>Take and replace the Tugboat with a Nurse . . . the journey through the waters with our patients in the unknown territories of healthcare. Holistic nursing supports patients through the unknown with spiritual underpinnings of respect, knowledge and a light heart.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The CIT, written by a health-patterning therapist in private practice, with the metaphor titled <italic>Spiral</italic>, describes her experience of working with people who have physical illnesses and how she helps them struggle with the emotional aspect of that experience.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One particular client . . . struggling with life-threatening leukemia . . . concerned about leaving her young grade school–age child . . . her husband . . . freedom from pain that was spiritual pain, physical pain, and emotional pain was critical in her care. Help her free herself of this pain as she spiraled, sometimes up, sometimes down, often in the course of a day. I worked with her to free herself for her impending journey beyond this life. She had a strong will to live, which indeed helped her survive beyond all expectation. She was an example of how someone with a devastating illness can be free and powerful. I was with her until the end, being the last person to truly have a conversation with her the evening before she passed over during the night. That was two years ago, and even now I frequently think of her. After her passing, her husband asked me to work with their child, which I did. I contact her husband every so often, on holidays and the anniversary of her final triumph of freedom.</p>
<p>As a holistic nurse in private practice, I spiral toward freedom each and every day, and hope that I teach clients to do so as well. It is a powerful experience and I am grateful to be a nurse doing what I love best, holistic nursing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0898010112461948">
<title>Gods Love/Peace/Spirituality</title>
<p>Six participants spoke of their connectedness with God, feelings of peace, and spirituality. One participant’s metaphor, <italic>Peace</italic>, was written by a certified advanced holistic nurse with more than 10 years of experience. She wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>It is a feeling, an attitude, a behavior, a state of mind, a greeting, a goal and one of the most powerful words of our language. We strive for it . . . seek it . . . pray for it, we “fight for it” in an ironic way. We defend it . . . desire it for ourselves and others . . . have a strong need for it . . . often go to lengths for a simple glimpse of it. We are taught it is our goal for the world, our community . . . for our family and friends. As the opposite of chaos we often get so focused on the chaos we loose the state of being peace creates.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Her CIT description is about an experience where she works as a nurse practitioner for an adult inpatient neurosurgery service line of a large Level I trauma hospital:<disp-quote>
<p>I find myself asking for peace on a regular basis. Having peace within me is often one of the largest struggles/battles I have with myself and the small world around me. I would often ask for God’s peace to surround me and give me patience. I love neurosurgery with all of the chaos it can potentially create on a daily basis. As a result I find myself seeking peace on a daily basis, sometimes on an hourly basis.</p>
<p>A female Hispanic patient had been on our service for a few weeks when it became necessary for us to have a multidisciplinary meeting with her husband. He was not trusting of the system . . . not very cooperative in completing his part of the process. The relationship with him and the hospital staff was tense at times . . . would often complain . . . demand special attention. Conversations with him were often tiring. I constantly had to remind myself to remain peaceful and ask God’s peace for him. As a team we decided we would gather all disciplines involved in her care to meet together with him to explain the choices he had and our plan of care. Unfortunately, when a facility accepts a patient for placement the decision needs to be made quickly for acceptance . . . husband stated he felt we were “kicking her out.” The sadness and fear in his eyes almost never showed a hint of peace. I truly believe my thoughts and constant sending of peace and peaceful energy to each of us and around the room was a huge success.</p>
<p>What could have potentially been a very highly charged, emotional meeting was a positive peaceful outcome. It was such a relief at the end that we all felt a sense of accomplishment. The main lesson for me during this particular situation was how wonderful the feeling of peace truly is.</p>

<sec id="section14-0898010112461948">
<title>Personal and Professional Growth and Development/Holistic Nursing</title>
<p>These nine participants’ metaphors expressed their ideals of what holistic nursing has meant to them.</p>
<p><italic>Equestrian Life</italic>, written by a Doctor of Nursing Practice, uses working with horses as her metaphor:<disp-quote>
<p>I have an <bold>arena</bold> of practice—this is where I have the opportunity to put into practice any new skills or ideas as I learn them to identify how they fit into practice. I have a <bold>mentorship Barn</bold>—this is where I get to network with others, a gathering place, obtaining assistance, share ideas. The <bold>trail of experience</bold>—where I actually develop my work over time, dealing with challenges and obstacles as they emerge. And the <bold>Pasture of enlightenment</bold>—this is where I regroup, where I let my new and old skills/knowledge/etc. “percolate” develop.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One participant, who titled her metaphor, <italic>The Keeper of Souls</italic>, shared in her CIT her experience as a manager during the merge of hospitals culturally different under a developing healthcare system. She wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>There was little trust or respect between the staff. In the quest for a new culture to form, Holistic Nursing came to the forefront. Seeding the organization with 12 holistic trained nurses allowed the progression that brought 30 staff through an extended course in holistic practice. This process . . . the work daily in holistic practice with the staff, led to award-winning recognitions from national, state and local health care organizations for the birthing of a healing holistic environment in a hospital. These outcomes speak to the successfulness of using holistic concepts to support healing. By keeping the faith and daily practicing holistically, the world I lived in was changed around me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0898010112461948">
<title>Guide/Coach</title>
<p>Five participants shared metaphors of how they assist others into knowing themselves and are resources for others who are in need.</p>
<p>One participant, with more than 28 years of nursing experience, titled her metaphor <italic>The Toolbox, the Antennae, and the Witness.</italic> Her metaphor is a beautiful expression of what a holistic nurse can do to help and assist others. She wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>As a holistic nurse, I show up . . . listen . . . assess . . . hear and identify people’s needs with a finely tuned antennae, those expressed and unexpressed. I use everything from skills…developed through practice to knowing I cannot explain. I . . . learned to listen with my all, trust my instincts . . . draw from a toolbox that includes therapeutic use of self through presence, assessment skills traditional nursing . . . communication to clarify and confirm my assessment.</p>
<p>I use communication tools to learn if what I think is best to guide . . . patient in what they think is best. Allow . . . wisdom to work toward healing. I am building new skills . . . adding new tools to . . . toolbox . . . seems simpler than when I started. Everything fits, everything counts . . . everything matters. I just need to show up. Often I am simply the witness after I remind people their bodies have wisdom . . . you come to the planet, you get a body; learn to listen to its wisdom.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One participant, who titled her metaphor, <italic>Ferryman/Gypsy Guide</italic>, shared in her CIT her experience of having changed positions away from the bedside now finding her patients to be the coworkers around her. She wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>I created a healing environment in my office . . . keep supplies there: heat packs, aroma therapy, massage oils, relaxation music, my charka box. They . . . gravitate to my office to “talk business” . . . usually just let them talk . . . before you know it . . . their face softens . . . tell me they are overwhelmed . . . stressed. I almost feel like the door is a little portal to a safe place, a sacred space. I even had people ask if they can just come in . . . sit in my office . . . makes them feel better. I have had everyone from . . . housekeepers to VPs show up at my door. I feel . . . they take the steps to my door . . . I take them down the path. The gypsy girl part is that I travel . . . I bring my wares to those in need. I am asked . . . to do centering. . . before meetings or talk groups though guided imagery when the stress level has gotten too high.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Metaphors are expressive tools for communicating experiences and emotions that convey multiple meanings simultaneously in a compact, intense, and vivid imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112461948">Fainsilber &amp; Ortony, 1987</xref>). Metaphors have the ability to promote awareness, insight, and a deeper comprehension of self, others, spirituality, emotions, and transformation and can enhance awareness of new ways of being and behaving. However, all forms of inquiry have limitations. Metaphors themselves can be perceived as constrictive and restrictive, by limiting one’s ability to view or accept new perspectives of the world we live in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112461948">Grant, 1992</xref>); thus, they can be “seductively reductionistic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112461948">Taylor, 1984</xref>, p. 11).</p>
<p>For these creative and reflective participants, there were no “negative” metaphors, but it is an important aspect of any study to understand the full dynamics of all tools. The metaphors and corresponding critical incident report were invariably informed by and articulated through the participants’ personal and professional experiences. The meaning evoked from the metaphors and CIT imbued aspects of each individual’s past, present, and future lived experiences, thus providing various opportunities that can lead to a new understanding of those experiences.</p>
<p>As the researcher, this was a true study of personal passion. The participants, these wonderful giving nurses, opened their hearts, minds, and souls to share with me their personal thoughts, their most precious memories and experiences. As the researcher, I was often overcome with a sense of awe, with a tightening in my throat, with tears streaming down my cheeks as I read and reread these beautiful words and saw the visual images. The undeniable expressive verbal pictures further exemplify the solid foundation that is holistic nursing.</p>
<p>Here are some personal reflections from participants after they completed this study: “I did my best to be brief . . . but found myself telling you the whole story. It was a wonderful exercise for me and brought back a lot of wonderful memories.” “Here is your completed questionnaire. Of course I am sitting here with tears in my eyes. It happens every time I tell my loving stories with moms and babies. Thank you for the opportunity to share again.”</p>
