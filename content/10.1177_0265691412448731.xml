<p>On 19 February 1937, the captain of the British warship <italic>H.M.S. Basilisk</italic> wired London with an account of a recent call to the port of Málaga in southern Spain. With the city having fallen under the heel of Franco’s troops earlier that month, the captain reported that it had proved impossible to rescue the Hungarian-born journalist and author Arthur Koestler from the clutches of the occupiers. ‘The opinion is’, the captain reflected, that ‘Koestler will be shot’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265691412448731">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Francoists did murder 7471 people in the province of Málaga, Koestler’s influential supporters managed to prise him from jail after a few months. Koestler went on to recount his capture and imprisonment in Spain in the book <italic>Dialogue with Death</italic> (1937). In one harrowing section, Koestler describes shaking from head to foot after batches his fellow prisoners were marched from the cells and sent to the firing squad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265691412448731">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>By a curiosity of history, one of Franco’s leading propagandists, Luis Bolín, had arrested Koestler. Koestler reported that Bolín’s father, who was also involved in the journalist’s detention, had bragged that he would take great pleasure in hunting down some ‘reds’ and killing them with his bare hands.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265691412448731">3</xref></sup> For his part, Luis Bolín would soon be elbowed out of his job after harassing foreign journalists and failing to squash the rumours that Franco’s Nazi and Italian allies had carried out the first terror bombing of a European city at Guernica in the Basque country in April 1937.</p>
<p>We can see in the encounter between Bolín and Koestler the collision of two lives marked by the rise of modern warfare which targeted civilians either as military objectives or for execution behind the lines. In the wider European historiography, the First World War has formed a crucial turning point in this move towards ‘total war’. Spain, of course, did not participate in the fighting in the Great War. Moreover, in some cases, historians of Spain have argued that the radicalization and brutalization brought about by the First World War in other European countries only arrived later in Spain. What comes across in a number of the books under review, however, is that the convulsions of the First World War deeply marked Spain and helped shape its own gruelling conflict of 1936–1939. As Hugo García tells us, for instance, in his impressive monograph on mobilizing British public opinion during the Spanish Civil War, Luis Bolín had worked for the Foreign Office in the First World War and had taken inspiration from the propaganda pumped out by the British authorities on German atrocities. In particular, publications such as the Bryce Report, with its carefully culled evidence skilfully woven into the text, exercised a decisive influence on Bolín. Just over a month into the Spanish conflict, on 27 August 1936, for example, Bolín ordered that in all newly captured towns witnesses ‘worthy of being believed’ should be sought out and their accounts of atrocities in government territory gathered for publication (García, 127). One result was the classic insurgent propaganda piece <italic>Preliminary Official Report on the Atrocities Committed in Southern Spain in July and August 1936, by the Communist Forces of the Madrid Government</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265691412448731">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>García argues that the Francoists took some care to verify many of the atrocities stories related in the report. This, however, does not alter the fact that Francoists routinely exaggerated the killings committed in government territory, with talk of up to 500,000 killed. Arthur Bryant, one of Franco’s British apologists, even went so far as to argue that 800,000 had perished (García, 129). With the figures still under revision historians now place the number at around 50,000.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265691412448731">5</xref></sup> The insurgents, meanwhile, constantly denied or vastly underplayed their own massacres. As García tells us, another of Franco’s propagandists, Alfonso Merry del Val, propounded in March 1937 that ‘the reds are necessarily slayers of their fellow men … mass-murderers, while the Nationalists only resorted to the death penalty when they had no other alternative’ (García, 124). Despite these assertions, the latest research shows that the rebels and Francoists carried out a planned and prolonged programme of execution of people felt to be associated with the Spanish Second Republic which left 130,000 people dead behind the lines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0265691412448731">6</xref></sup> Many of these victims continue to go without a dignified burial and still rest in unmarked mass graves.</p>
<p>One of the great merits of <italic>The Agony of Spanish Liberalism: From Revolution to Dictatorship, 1913–1923</italic> edited by Francisco J. Romero and Angel Smith is that it goes back to the First World War watershed to examine the origins of the political polarization and the horrific violence that characterized the Spanish Civil War. In doing so a number of contributors to this thought-provoking volume place the Spanish case firmly within the European context from which it is often held apart and show how an intransigent and violent nationalist right emerged in the shadows of the First World War.</p>
<p>In his chapter on the employers’ dirty war in Barcelona, Francisco J. Romero explains how the city suffered the affliction of a troubled history with a large and unionized working class, inflexible employers, nationalist feeling, restless army officers and a widespread mistrust of the central authorities in Madrid. As he graphically puts it, however, the dramatic transformations ushered in by the Great War ‘lit the fuse’ of this powder keg (Romero in Romero and Smith, 176). The steep increase in industrial production to try and satiate the demands particularly of France and the UK, helped kindle this fuse. On the one hand the boom sucked in large numbers of migrant workers to the city, who were forced to endure insalubrious and cramped living conditions; on the other hand the dramatic rise in profits led to soaring prices that far outstripped wage rises. With German spies conspiring to disrupt production, and radical anarchists pursuing negotiation by assassination, the level of violence began to surge.</p>
<p>What frightened employers most, however, was not the violence perpetrated by the left, but the growing sway of the unions. Romero demonstrates this by reference to the strike at Barcelona’s Ebro Irrigation and Power Company, popularly known as La Canadiense, in early 1919. The stoppage marked a deeply significant union victory when the central government insisted on wage rises, the reimbursement of pay lost in the strike, amnesty for all those imprisoned, and an eight-hour day conceded in the construction industry alongside an undertaking to extend this crucial concession to other sectors. At this point, leading employers turned their backs on the parliamentary government for its feeble stance and took up the gun. Working in league with an assortment of army officers, spies and paramilitary groups, the employers went out of their way to smash the unions. The lockout and assassination became part of the standard fare of this dirty war. In 1923, the killings still continued, and now the employers began to target moderate members of the anarcho-syndicalist movement who hoped to negotiate and bring about some form of reconciliation between the unions and the employers.</p>
<p>As Angel Smith notes in his finely researched chapter on the Catalan middle-class and regionalist party, the Lliga Regionalista, the First World War and the La Canadiense dispute heralded a radical shift to the right. For Smith, the story of the Lliga Regionalista forms part of the history of European liberals and conservatives of the period becoming complicit with authoritarians and fascists. While the Lliga had previously fought for democratic reform, in the wake of the La Canadiense dispute in 1919 it began to portray members of the left, in many cases made up of migrants from other parts of Spain, as ethnic outsiders. The Lliga’s leader, Francesc Cambó, also adopted ever more apocalyptic language, declaring that a struggle had developed between those who ‘propose to destroy present day society’ and those who ‘defend the essential bases of our… civilization’ (Smith in Romero and Smith, 157). In this situation, the party began to heap praise upon the civil governor of Barcelona, General Severiano Martínez Anido, who from November 1920 to October 1922 relied on a range of murky gunmen to shoot down many leading union members. At the same time, the Lliga blamed the central government for the chaos and the violence it often pinned on union members, although in many cases, of course, employers in league with Martínez Anido stood behind the killings.</p>
<p>One of the contributions made by Alejandro Quiroga on Spanish conservative nationalism is to show how the drift to authoritarian solutions had begun before the First World War, and gathered pace as a result of the conflagration. As Quiroga explains, by the 1910s ‘the three major components of Spanish conservative nationalism in the 20th century’ – militarism, hostility to Catalan and Basque nationalism, and the concept of Catholicism as the spiritual essence of the nation – had taken root. In the wake of the First World War, however, the apocalyptic tones of the far right found fertile ground. The Conservative leader Antonio Maura and his followers provide an example. Before the First World War Maura, a personal friend of Charles Maurras, had called for a revolution from above. Despite this, after the war he lost faith in parliament, believed the left had to be stopped with violence, and welcomed Mussolini’s rise to power in Italy. In 1918, Mauristas, among others, helped form the Liga Patriótica Española which ‘specialized in street fighting and shootings’ and provided ‘shock troops’ against ‘separatists’ (Quiroga in Romero and Smith, 207).</p>
<p>In his concluding chapter to the volume, Sebastian Balfour examines the making of an interventionist army and its turn towards authoritarianism. For Professor Balfour a particular turning point came in 1921 with the disaster suffered by the colonial army at Annual in North Africa when over 9000 Spanish officers lost their lives, with many of the corpses being mutilated. Balfour contends that:<disp-quote>
<p>The violence of the Moroccan enemy unleashed a reaction-repression logic, which after Annual in particular, swept away all reserve about methods of war, even amongst relatively progressive offices. The atrocities committed by the enemy were considered as validating a response in kind. (Balfour in Romero and Smith, 268)</p></disp-quote>Officers began to deny that Moroccans could stake an equal claim to human worth, and started to drop chemical weapons from the air against tribesmen, while soldiers on the ground committed all manner of atrocities against civilians identified as the other. Importantly, these tactics were later transferred to Spain during the Civil War.</p>
<p>Sid Lowe demonstrates the existence of similarly brutal attitudes in his meticulously researched, finely written and ground-breaking account of the Juventud de Acción Popular, JAP. The JAP formed the youth section of the mass Catholic political movement Popular Action which became part of the giant confederation of Catholic political groups, the CEDA (Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas). The aggression of the youth wing comes across vividly in a speech at the JAP’s first national assembly at El Escorial outside Madrid on 22 April 1934. The orator, as recounted by Lowe, proclaimed that ‘Spain had become infected by a foreign disease, a twentieth-century incarnation of the Moors – embodied by liberalism, Marxism and separatism – and the JAP would react to bring about its salvation, re-conquering the nation and banishing the invador’ (Lowe, 15).</p>
<p>Importantly, Lowe argues the prominence of the Franco-dominated Falange Española Tradicionalista de las Jons from 1937 has obscured from view this belligerent mass Catholic youth movement that emerged earlier in the 1930s. The irony, however, was that as the JAP’s radicalization penetrated ever deeper into the political territory of fascism, it was ‘to the JAP, not the Falange, that most of those who wanted to express their nationalism in bolder, more radical and newer ways turned’ (Lowe, 103). Accordingly, the JAP rather than ‘the lack of any discernable fascist constituency’ explains why the Falange failed before the Civil War (Lowe, 7). Lowe’s admirable task becomes writing the history of this neglected organization, which, he argues, provided vast numbers of men who later joined the Falange, fought on the front for the Francoists, offered up the ideology of the crusade and served up an entire social base of support for the Franco regime.</p>
<p>Despite nipping in the bud the growth of the Falange, the JAP did find itself changed by its encounter with fascism. As a result it moved away from its position within the old style right and towards a much harsher stance. The effect for Lowe was that:<disp-quote>
<p>the JAP offered a ‘bridge’ between conservatism and fascism, driving the only genuine force on the parliamentary right towards an openly authoritarian solution, challenging conservative political orthodoxy in a bid to impose a ‘new’, paramilitary politics that would be ‘virile’ and ‘youthful’. (Lowe, 7)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>To Lowe’s great credit he recounts with some skill the story of how the JAP helped push its parent party, the CEDA, towards fascism. This mattered because Lowe argues that the CEDA, with at one stage over one million members, became Spain’s largest ever political party. Significantly, the JAP set itself the task of ‘cleansing’ and ‘purifying’ the CEDA. With Lowe judging that the JAP could well have counted on 200,000 members of its own (at a time when the Falange had a maximum of 10,000 members), it certainly had some muscle to do this. In the author’s view, these members increasingly spoke in language redolent of fascism, declaring that there could be no dialogue with the ‘anti-Spain’, defined by one JAP activist as ‘Jews, arch-heretics, Protestants, communists, Moors, Enclyopedists, Francophiles, Masons, Krausists, liberals, marxists’ (Lowe, 34). Tellingly, Lowe’s position cuts against a number of other scholars. Stanley Payne and Michael Mann are rejected for considering that the fascism of the JAP was ambiguous or half baked (Lowe, 26). Michael Seidman is dispatched for considering that fascism in Spain appeared as a mass movement only with the revolt of July 1936 that led to the Civil War (Lowe, 168).</p>
<p>In its description of the killing behind the lines, foreshadowed in the pronouncements of the JAP, Julián Casanova’s volume shines out as one of the best accounts in English of the violence that still provokes considerable debate in present-day Spain. Before arriving at this grim part of the tale, however, Professor Casanova dexterously steers the reader through the troubled political landscape of the Second Republic in the period leading up to the Civil War. A central message conveyed by Casanova is that the conflict formed not one but many wars. It began as a military struggle when rebels buried the possibility of a political solution by mounting a serious armed revolt against the elected government. It also became a class war; a war of religion; a war which pitched Spanish nationalists against regionalists; a war between Fascists, democrats and Communists, and an international struggle between powers trying to define the world order. Casanova nimbly guides the reader through this whirlwind.</p>
<p>For Casanova the coup of July 1936 under the leadership of General Mola, and with significant backing from large parts of the army and many civilians, and especially the CEDA and the JAP, marks a truly pivotal moment. Casanova shows how in the period before the revolt in July 1936 there was nothing inevitable about the coup triggering Civil War. In this regard, Casanova cuts against the argument put forward by the US Hispanist Stanley Payne that polarization and violence in Spain had reached such telling levels that democracy was set to collapse (Casanova, 147).</p>
<p>To support his claim, Casanova takes issue with Payne’s contention that in the spring of 1936 Spain suffered an unprecedented wave of strikes and disorder. Instead, Casanova advances the view that the anarcho-syndicalist CNT stood at its lowest ebb in Republican times at this period. In a difficult situation, the CNT found that it had to negotiate rather than launch the type of insurrections that had characterized its activities earlier in the Republic. Moreover, at its Congress in Saragossa in May 1936, the CNT declared that the time was not right for revolution. Proof of this particular pudding perhaps resides in the figures for rural strikes in 1936, which were no higher than in 1931 (the first year of the Republic) or 1934 (when the left launched its failed revolt) (Casanova, 132–3).</p>
<p>This, of course, is not to deny that violence did take place in the first months of 1936. Indeed it did, and leading historian Eduardo González Calleja has shown through rigorous research that the majority of the violence emanated from the right rather than the left.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0265691412448731">7</xref></sup> Nor is it to deny that many on the right felt that their livelihoods stood under threat. But to understand the origins of the coup it might be more fruitful to look towards the politics of the right and the failure of the centre and centre-left to keep its grip on power. The CEDA, for instance, partly under pressure from its JAP base, now began, in Casanova’s words, ‘a decisive shift to authoritarian ideas’ (Casanova, 137). The turn to violence can clearly be seen in Casanova’s figure that 15,000 members of the JAP, in the spring of 1936, flooded into the ranks of the Falange, with its open commitment to the politics of the gun. The Catholic and extreme-right newspapers started to push readers towards revolt. Meanwhile, a split in the powerful Socialist Party meant that an effort to put Indalecio Prieto into office as prime minister came to nought, and the new government had to get by without Socialists in the cabinet. In this sense, disintegration as much as polarization explains the weakness of the Republic. At the end of the day, however, the war began, ‘because a military uprising weakened and undermined the ability of the State and the republican government to maintain order’ (Casanova, 148). More than this, for Casanova, the coup d’état opened the floodgates to mass violence.</p>
<p>In Casanova’s view, the rebels rolled out a policy of terror to destroy all possibility of workers resisting their coup. In places where the rebels succeeded, prominent political figures such as mayors and trade union officials were often the first to be killed and dumped in ditches. In those regions under control of the rebels from the outset of the conflict between 50 and 70 per cent of the total number of victims in those regions met their grim fate in July and August 1936 (Casanova, 164). Large mass graves sprung up across rebel-held Spain. The small village of Lardero, near Logroño, for instance, saw 400 of its citizens slaughtered (Casanova, 165). These killings would continue, and historians estimate that in the 10 years following the end of the conflict, the Francoists murdered 50,000 people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0265691412448731">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In government-controlled territory, meanwhile, the arming of the workers to put down the revolt created the conditions in which bevies of village committees, militias and vigilantes set on ‘hunting for Fascists’ sprouted up across government territory (Casanova, 169). In many of these places, suppressing the revolt became fused with defending the revolution that a number of these groups wanted to launch in the wake of the coup. The high point of this terror, however, came in the summer of 1936. As Casanova tells us, over 50 per cent of the 8352 killings in Catalonia took place before the end of September and 80 per cent by the end of the year (Casanova, 196). The decline in the rate of killing reflected the re-establishment of control achieved by the Republican government over the revolutionary groups.</p>
<p>These horrific deaths reveal the way modern war breaches the distinction between the frontline and the rearguard. One of the contributions of Hugo García’s volume is to trace the way these atrocities in turn became part of another aspect of modern war: the battle for public opinion. As the Spanish scholar tells us on page one of his book, this battle forms a central component of total war. García ably sets his tale in the United Kingdom: which mattered because the British exercised a decisive influence over events in Europe, and the crucial Non-Intervention Committee had made its home in London. Interestingly, García makes his monograph not just about propaganda but also about history. For the interpretations offered up by the war propagandists, such as the Francoist argument that the war represented a struggle against Communism, or the government contention that the war constituted a defence of democracy, continue to be chewed over by historians in our own day. Accordingly, for British journalist and insurgent apologist Harold Cardozo the violence in Republican territory took such a brutal and systematic form that it could only have been born from a considered ‘political plan imposed by Moscow’ (García, 124). Certainly historians leaning towards the right such as Stanley Payne reject such crude interpretations. But the best-selling polemicist Pío Moa has breathed fresh life into the idea that the insurgents responded to the violence of the left.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0265691412448731">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>García, for his part, seeks to steer a course between the insurgent and government propaganda campaigns, and to explore how the two sides sought to win over public opinion. The Madrid-based scholar makes profitable use of sources both in Spain and the United Kingdom and frames his story well. His narrative reaches back to the First World War and the subsequent move towards mass communications, the rise of international society and organizations, and the growing sensitivity to the fragility of human life in the new age of total war.</p>
<p>Hugo García focuses profitably on the work of Harold Lasswell, who in 1927 published <italic>Propaganda Technique in the World War</italic>. Lasswell argued the British gave a new scientific rigour to atrocity literature, which effectively identified their cause with the defence of human rights, and criminalized the enemy. For sociologists such as Lasswell, propaganda of this type could act like a magic bullet, stimulating an immediate and direct response from all its audience.</p>
<p>In his monograph García sets out to show how Spanish propagandists sought to ape these methods. From the government side, the foreign minister at some stages of the war, Julio Álvarez del Vayo, is singled out as someone who realized early in the day the value of portraying Republicans as victims. The government, in García’s reading, also learned from Wilson’s Fourteen Points and sought to portray itself as the defender of democracy and self-determination. The insurgents for their part, as we have seen, took inspiration from the Bryce Report.</p>
<p>A great strength of the book is that despite copious study of the propaganda texts produced by both sides, the author retains a sense of detachment. Certainly García argues his study is significant, advancing the view that in the field of propaganda, more than any other, the Spanish Civil War can be considered a dress rehearsal for the Second World War. But he concludes soberly, and convincingly, that the Spanish conflict and the propaganda associated with it ‘aroused unprecedented levels of idealism; but also a great degree of indifference, which prefigured the generalized apathy and scepticism that have dominated our own societies’ (García, 2–3). That scepticism, however, resides too in historians. We can see this at several stages of García’s book when the work of Álvarez del Vayo comes under critical examination. The author is surely right to argue that in the aftermath of the failed revolt of October 1934 the wiley Álvarez del Vayo hoped to make political capital by spotlighting the torture and suffering of those singled out for punishment. All of this, however, raises the question of sincerity, and this is a topic García seems reluctant to address. Accordingly, we are told on page 25 that Álvarez del Vayo stood out as a politician who understood that international opinion could be used to save victims of repression. Despite this we do not learn if Álvarez del Vayo acted simply from political expediency or in the interests of humanitarianism too. This leaves the reader much poorer and makes it harder to assess, for instance, why Álvarez del Vayo would shortly afterwards become active in efforts to achieve the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0265691412448731">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, exploring the two sides’ propaganda machines with the admirable detachment displayed by García also raises the question of the moral differences between the two parties. Here we find a great contrast with Paul Preston’s book on journalists in the Spanish Civil War, <italic>We Saw Spain Die: Foreign Correspondents in the Spanish Civil War</italic>, which plainly sets out the author’s view that the Republic acted in a much more worthy manner towards journalists than the insurgents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0265691412448731">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The edited collection <italic>Unearthing Franco’s Legacy: Mass Graves and the Recovery of Historical Memory in Spain</italic> also takes a less detached approach than García. This is unsurprising for a volume which deals with the efforts since the year 2000 by a number of civil associations to exhume the remains of some of the tens of thousands of victims of Franco’s assassins left in anonymous mass graves. As Ignacio Fernández De Mata points out in his moving chapter, working on this question becomes not a matter of scientific neutrality but rather a moral issue. To provide an insight into some of the ethical questions at stake he cites the case of Restituto Velasco who became involved in a mass exhumation in Aranda in the province of Burgos. Driving Velasco forward was an undertaking he had given to his aunt as she lay dying that he would rescue the remains of her husband from the ignominy of the mass grave. Fernández also takes an interest in the way exhumations throw up new moral dilemmas. Exhumations reveal, he tells us, ‘the hard evidence of death in the midst of communities used to the silent and often complicit cover up of the past’ (Fernández de Mata in Jerez-Farrán and Amago, 292).</p>
<p>To appreciate this point we need to bear in mind the fact that while Francoists long trumpeted the killings in the Republican zone in the Civil War, they kept silent about the murders in the territory they controlled. During the transition to democracy that followed Franco’s death in November 1975, Spaniards would not risk opening up old wounds and raking over the past. As the editors note in their introduction, it is only in the last 10 years that some Spaniards have tried to unearth this long silenced past. But they have done so without the help of truth and reconciliation committees or the bringing of perpetrators to book. Instead, the exhumations have offered one of the few ways of finding solace and dealing with the consequences of total war.</p>
<p>For many of the authors in the volume, these issues raise important questions about the relationship between history, in the sense of the scholarly investigation of the past, and memory, in terms both of the recollections of now ageing individuals who suffered the repression, and the collective understandings of the past held by members of Spanish society. For Michael Richards, the start of the twenty-first century saw a slew of new memoirs hit the shelves. The danger lurking behind the memory boom for Richards, however, is the tendency of publishers to veer towards the superficial and to mark off the past as finished. Instead, Richards proposes that we appreciate the way in which memory of the past becomes shaped both by the values of the present, and the myths of the past. From this position he argues that memories can be most effectively appreciated ‘when placed within a framework informed by social and historical methods’ (Richards in Jerez-Farrán and Amago, 123).</p>
<p>Jo Labanyi explores similar terrain in her chapter arguing that the Francoist repression helped to construct a form of collective memory in which pivotal political issues about the past and how we deal with it in the present remain obscured. She argues that to try and overcome this problem scholars need to explore the ‘emotional attitudes towards the past in the present time of the speaker’ (Labanyi in Jerez-Farrán and Amago, 193). Fernández de Mata provides us with some revealing evidence that helps us make sense of Labanyi’s points. As he notes, the exhumations present a particular challenge for those bereaved relatives who, after the Francoist victory in the Civil War, had ‘accepted the regime’s logic that blamed their murdered parents not only for their deaths but also for the problems they [the dead relatives] caused for the surviving family members. Some even held jobs in the Francoist political structure’ (Fernández de Mata in Jerez-Farrán and Amago, 295). At an exhumation in Villamayor de los Montes in Burgos province in 2004, for instance, one man whose, presumably left-wing, father was buried in the mass grave tried to head off the dig. It turned out he was an active member of the conservative Popular Party which is made up of many descendents of Francoists and opposes the exhumations (Fernández de Mata in Jerez-Farrán and Amago, 296).</p>
<p>As Paul Preston’s vivid chapter on ‘theorists of extermination’ shows, however, the historian can also excel when imparting understanding of the context in which events took place, and in the process revealing long hidden aspects of the past. Preston does this with his hallmark verve by exploring the mind set of many Francoist killers. Preston demonstrates, with a mountain of gripping evidence, the chilling brutality of those who helped incite and promote Franco’s war against civilians behind the lines. For Preston, as with some of the other scholars under review, the First World War forms a turning point. He argues it gave a new intensity to anti-Semitism in Spain as Socialists and Russian revolutionaries were now alleged to be bankrolled by Jews. In the turmoil of Spain after the First World War, anti-Semites blurred the distinctions between Jews, centre, left and anarchist groups. Even vegetarians, nudists and advocates of Esperanto became lumped together as members of the anti-Spain. As social and political conflict grew from April 1931 and the arrival of the Second Republic, the propaganda that ‘left-wingers and liberals were neither really Spanish nor really human and that, as a threat to the nation’s existence, they should be exterminated’ became increasingly successful (Preston in Jerez-Farrán and Amago, 45).</p>
<p>Preston illustrates his theme with the startling case of Catalan priest Juan Tusquets Terrats. In Tusquets’ mind, Jews, Socialists and Freemasons were all in league together to foist the Second Republic on Spain. A prolific author of books and newspaper articles, Tusquets received an invitation from the International Anti-Masonic Association to visit the newly opened Dachau concentration camp. As Preston cites Tusquets, ‘they did it to show what we had to do in Spain’ (Preston in Jerez-Farrán and Amago, 50). Preston, of course, is the foremost authority on Francisco Franco, and points out that the Spanish general ‘enthusiastically devoured’ Tusquets’ ‘anti-Masonic and anti-Semitic diatribes’ (Preston in Jerez-Farrán and Amago, 51). Increasingly, Franco began to see the working class as under the tutelage of Moscow. For Preston this explains why in the wake of a workers’ uprising in Asturias in October 1934 Franco deployed troops against Spanish civilians ‘as if they were a foreign enemy’ (Preston in Jerez-Farrán and Amago, 61).</p>
<p>These views were not confined to Franco alone. One of Tusquets’ soul-mates, writing under the pseudonym Mauricio Karl, published similar thoughts in <italic>Asesinos de España</italic>. Sympathizers distributed 100,000 free copies among members of the armed forces. Throwing down the gauntlet to the army, Karl argued in his tract that the once great Spain was lost to ‘Zion because the sons of Spain no longer know how to die. Nor how to kill’ (Preston in Jerez-Farrán and Amago, 64). Seen from this perspective, the Communist-leaning Koestler was lucky to escape with his life, now that civilians defined as agents of the Soviet Union had become the enemy who Francoists felt needed and deserved to be killed.</p>
