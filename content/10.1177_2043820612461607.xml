The book is constructed around the notions of scale and power to address the complexity of environmental issues and aims at increasing the awareness of contradictions regarding environmental choices. It has a simple message: scale matters, power matters, and the discrepancies between the scales at which an environmental process evolves, and the scales of governance are the significant barriers to adequate reactions. Beyond that, the book also aims at demonstrating that there is no right way to tackle environmental problems but there are always contested ways to do so.</p><p>This (rather short) book is rich in examples, staged in different places and scales, with a certain bias toward the United States when it comes to Western examples, but including also many cases from the global South. There are many great examples, famous ones (Lake Victoria) and less famous ones, such as those drawing from her own fieldwork in the Azerbaijan (in the chapter on resource conflict). The cases are often presented as unrelated, or at least the relationship and interdependence between them (often the result of globalized chains of production or of waste disposal) are not always stressed as much as it could be. This applies to relationships between both the cases in different locations as cases in different chapters/topics.</p><p>The book is (rather sparsely) illustrated with pictures, graphs, and cartoons. From a geographic perspective, one would have expected more maps showing the locations and the flows of environmental processes under debate. Each chapter opens with one or two relevant quotes from <italic>Harper’s Index</italic>, a department with ‘ironic statistics arranged for thoughtful effect’ (as the Wikipedia description goes) published in the US left-leaning general interest magazine <italic>Harper’s Magazine</italic>. Indeed, the author aptly weaves together a wealth of academic studies but also a lot of media accounts of the contested issues in environmental politics.</p><p>In this commentary, I would like to present four points of discussion not so much to highlight shortcomings as to provide departures to use the book in class.</p><sec id="section12-2043820612461607"><title>Temporal scale matters as well</title><p>After a short but strong introduction of the notions of environment, scale and power, the book addresses six broad environmental issues: climate change, oil and energy, food security, garbage and waste, toxins, and resource conflict, apparently running from the seemingly most globalized to the seemingly most territorial types of conflict – ‘seemingly’ as the book demonstrates. Each selection has its pros and cons but I would have appreciated a justification of this particular selection. A most remarkable absence is that of nuclear energy, as it would have been a particularly welcome example to explore one dimension of scale that is a bit neglected: time. More than other environmentally consequential activities, decisions about nuclear plants and nuclear waste management typically involve different perceptions and representations of risks and opportunities for extremely long time periods, certainly compared with a human lifetime, but even compared to civilizations or geological formations. In addition, recent debates about nuclear energy are particularly interesting when it comes to framing. In response to worries about CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, nuclear energy has been increasingly presented as an ecological alternative to carbon energy sources, notwithstanding the problems regarding nuclear waste management, risks of accidents, and vulnerability to terrorism. This makes it an ideal field to analyze the framing and scaling of arguments pro and contra and to follow the evolution of alliances and policy networks promoting and opposing it over the past five decades.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2043820612461607"><title>Anthropocentric perspectives</title><p>As Simon Dalby discusses in his commentary, the author acknowledges that we live in the Anthropocene Age. It is also worth noting that she also reports many anthropocentric arguments to care for certain environmental consequences, especially for animals’ welfare. I was particularly impressed by a quote of an critical portrayal of the activities of the corporation Smithfield Foods by Tietz in <italic>Rolling Stone</italic> in 2006 (quoted in O'Lear, 2010):<disp-quote><p>In 2005, Smithfield Foods killed 27 million hogs: “That’s a number worth considering. A slaughter-weight hog is fifty percent heavier than a person. The logistical challenge of processing that many pigs each year is roughly equivalent to butchering and boxing the entire human population of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose, Detroit, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, San Francisco, Columbus, Austin, Memphis, Baltimore, Fort Worth, Charlotte, El Paso, Milwaukee, Seattle, Boston, Denver, Louisville, Washington D.C., Nashville, Las Vegas, Portland, Oklahoma City and Tucson.” (Tietz, 2006, in O'Lear, 2010: 106–107).</p></disp-quote>This breathtaking enumeration made quite an impact on me, reading it in the Netherlands. The country (with 16 million inhabitants, which is somewhat lesser than Florida, with 42,000 km<sup>2</sup>, which is somewhat smaller than Tennessee, and with a gross domestic product (GDP) between New York and Florida) is known to house as many pigs as inhabitants. However, the statistics varies between 13 million pigs slaughtered, according to the national statistical office, Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS), and 20 million pigs bred, according to the established advocacy group <italic>Varkens in Nood</italic> (meaning ‘Pigs in Distress’). The difference could be explained by the huge number of pigs that are bred in the Netherlands but transported alive to Italy to be slaughtered there as Parma ham, a perverse consequence of the European Union (EU) regulation regarding the protection of regional labels for certain products.</p><p>Despite the existence of <italic>Varkens in Nood</italic> (campaigning since 1997, with the help of many celebrities including its founder, the bestselling author JJ Voskuil) and <italic>Partij voor de Dieren</italic> (PvdD; meaning ‘Party for the Animals’) with several representatives in both the chambers of the Parliament (but short of votes for a seat in the Dutch delegation to the European Parliament), to my knowledge no one has framed the comparison in such a way. Possibly the influential role of World War II in Dutch history makes a comparison of the slaughtering of pigs to the industrially planned and managed destruction of human population unthinkable and unspeakable, as it necessarily recalls the Holocaust (do not even bother to ponder about the connotations of the comparison of pigs and Jews that it seems to imply). Indeed, although the PvdD has been rather successful to bring ritual slaughtering on the political agenda, and advanced a law proposal to forbid it, affecting kosher and halal food chains, it has a much less impressive record when it comes to constraining the expanding and intensive industrial cattle breeding and the construction of mega-stables (15,000 pigs and a million chickens) in an densely urbanized country (with a overall population density of 400 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>, similar to that in Rhode Island and New Jersey).</p><p>Moreover, in a country traumatized by the murder of a leading politician, Pim Fortuijn, by an animals’ rights activist in May 2002, the first political murder for centuries (if one put the German occupation during World War II into brackets), one might also want to avoid blurring the line between killing animals and killing people. It does not mean that the anthropocentric framing of animals does not occur, but it tends to be less confronting, as demonstrated by the poster widely used by <italic>Varkens in Nood</italic> showing a hog in bed with two Dutch celebrities Georgina Verbaan and Katja Schuurman.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2043820612461607">1</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section3-2043820612461607"><title>A world of individualist consumers</title><p>As the author stresses, politics is much more than policies. Broadening the introduction of environmental issues to get beyond legislation, policy at different administrative scales, including international conventions, is a good idea. It raises the awareness of students of the inherent conflicts involved. Politics implies struggling about contested problems and contested solutions. State actors deploying environmental policies are not the only ones that matter. The drawback of the author’s approach is that it often ends up with individual solutions, stressing consumers’ choices. What is a sound thing to do as a consumer? What is sensitive and responsible? Should I stop eating meat? Should I compensate my CO<sub>2</sub>-production? and so on.</p><p>Although it gives readers food for thoughts and engages students with the topic by addressing their own daily behavior, it emphasizes certain types of politics and ignores others. There is little to be found about differences in terms of collective initiatives and perspectives regarding awareness, policies, and politics. There is little about green parties, environmental movements, and environment justice movements, while they are well institutionalized and influential, at least in some places. For example, Green parties that have been electorally and strategically quite successful in certain Western European countries participate in local, regional and even national governmental coalitions, and play a significant role in the European Parliament.</p><p>Thinking critically about these different political dynamics is empowering as it shows how environmental politics depend again more on politics than environmental issues proper. It is very useful to make students think and rethink the environmental politics in the place they live or the place they know best through the comparison with the examples provided in the book, a bit like I did above, drawing lessons from campaigning against Smithfield Foods for Dutch pig politics.</p><p>The media are acknowledged for their role in the framing of environmental issues but the circulation of information and knowledge about the environment and about environmental politics is left in the shadow. The media are also indispensable to circulate information about international legal frameworks, activities of corporations in different places and their consequences, and to enhance collaboration between action groups in different locations (including scale jumping). The new media have opened great opportunities to bypass conventional media that tend to be vulnerable for the control of the state and/or corporate interests. Such an example is the making and the distribution of the documentary <italic>The Age of Stupid</italic> (2009, directed by Franny Armstrong). As an early instance of crowd founding and bottom-up circulation (see http://www.spannerfilms.net/ for details), the movie effectively connects the viewers and the activists across large distances, and convene many facets of the consequences of the global oil economy through interrelated and juxtaposed vignettes. It also highlights different kinds of individual and collective responses to these consequences.</p></sec><sec id="section4-2043820612461607"><title>Myths of nature</title><p>Patterns of political mobilization are not evenly distributed around the globe and are in turn the result of social relationships, as are the patterns of perceptions and preferences regarding environmental risks. In the concluding chapter, O’Lear introduces an important conceptual framework to tackle differences between views of the environment. She discussed four myths of nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820612461607">Schwarz and Thompson, 1990</xref>) that corresponded to different visions of the vulnerability of nature and the impact of human interventions: nature tolerant, nature benign, nature ephemeral, and nature capricious.</p><p>It is a rather strange choice to do so in the conclusion. The scheme is not a conclusion or a summary of different aspects that have been presented in the book. It is a heurisitic device to simplify the diversity of views of nature that exist along each other. The scheme would have helped to structure the presentation and the analysis of contradictory arguments regarding the environmental conflicts addressed in the book. Moreover, there is much more to say about these four myths of nature, as the work of Michael Thomson and Michiel Schwarz emerged from a rather rich school known as ‘cultural theory’ or ‘grid group analysis’ following the inspiring work of the British anthropologists Douglas and Thompson and the American political scientist Wildavsky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612461607">Douglas, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612461607">1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612461607">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612461607">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612461607">Douglas and Wildavsky, 1982</xref>; Thompson, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2043820612461607">Thompson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820612461607">1999</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612461607">Hood, 1998</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612461607">Mamadouh, 1999</xref> for introductory texts). It has been particularly popular in the field of environmental issues, dealing with deforestation, flood control, risk analysis, and resource curse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612461607">Gyawali, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612461607">Hendriks, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612461607">Richards, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820612461607">Thompson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2043820612461607">Verweij and Thompson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820612461607">Verweij et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2043820612461607">Wolsink, 2004</xref>). This body of literature shows how these views of nature also correlate with different views of power and politics that characterize different ways of life. These four ways of life are often labeled as the hierarchist, individualist, egalitarian, and fatalist ways of life. These patterns of institutional preferences include, for example, different conceptions of expertise and the role of experts in environmental politics. Similarly, each views correlate with specific preferences for political organization and with specific ways to justify the distribution of risks and negative externalities.</p><p>The author’s choice to provide these perspectives only later on reads at first sight as a missed opportunity. I would rather like to reframe it as an opportunity for lecturers using the book in class. Let your students read first the introduction and the conclusion, think about the framework about the myths of nature, and use it systematically when they engage with the many examples of environmental conflicts they found in the thematic chapters.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2043820612461607"><title>A textbook for a political geography class</title><p>The book would be of great use in various classes, in environmental politics of course, but certainly in geography too. Despite the lively debate about scale in the discipline (culminating in the provocative plea for a human geography without scale by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612461607">Marston et al. (2005</xref>)), there are hardly any textbooks that introduce students to scale issues (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612461607">Herod, 2010</xref> for an introduction to the concept of scale). Nevertheless, the book is less suitable if one wishes to socialize geography students into the discipline and stimulate their disciplinary consciousness. Although the book does a good job at introducing students and other advanced readers to the importance of scale, it does not really convene the idea that geographers are contributing significantly to the study of environmental politics (and scale). For example, think of the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612461607">Kurtz (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612461607">2003</xref>) on conflicts around toxic waste and scaling and counter-scaling in the discourses framing environmental justice. The book could have been a vehicle for advertising the geographers’ work on environmental issues, but the author does not systematically foreground such studies or publications in geographic academic journals. Expanding the analysis to broader geographical considerations would be welcome too for a geography class: there are not only technological solutions to energy needs but also different ways to organize spatially that might reduce oil consumption (compact urbanism, biking as daily mode of transport, local food production, teleworking, etc.).Therefore, I would argue that in geography, rather than a textbook for an environmental geography class, it is a textbook particularly suitable for a political geography class, because it mainly helps students understand – through environmental issues – how scale and power work, which are first and foremost political geopolitical topics.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Note</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2043820612461607"><label>1.</label><p>see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.varkensinnood.nl/steun_stichting_varkens_in_nood_webwinkel.htm">http://www.varkensinnood.nl/steun_stichting_varkens_in_nood_webwinkel.htm</ext-link>: a Web site where the poster can be ordered.
