<p>The book goes in a well-managed step-by-step manner starting with throwing light on the general backdrop of HIV/AIDS highlighting the main achievements in the direction of decline in HIV infection rates, sexually transmitted diseases, MTC transmission rates, healthcare related infections and prolonged survival with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and vaccine development in Asian countries. Special emphasis has been laid on various issues concerning HIV/AIDS with specific focus on Asian countries, such as, India, in the context of nation-wide response towards the epidemic, response and challenges in China, response in Cambodia, response and lessons learnt in Thailand, having massive concentration of transgender, epidemic scenario in Vietnam, challenges in Pakistan and real-life cases of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, as these countries have been more vulnerable to the epidemic. The content covered in the context of these countries provides basis for comparison among them.</p>
<p>The scenario of HIV/AIDS in the last three decades has been reflected in this compilation by bringing to fore ground realities by the medium of case studies which gives the reader an outlook towards the reality. Very importantly, clinical management of HIV/AIDS has been discussed by bringing out detailed guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of the epidemic and availability and feasibility of treatment, thus presenting a measure for a prolonged life to a large population. The book, on the whole, attempts to cover and present all crucial issues around HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>The book has a well-organized layout with proper sequencing of the content and arrangement of heads and sub-heads.</p>
<p>The presented work on HIV/AIDS would inform the planners and policy makers about the prevailing scenario, as brought about in different Asian countries. Country-specific planning can be done in this regard keeping in view the kind of population and response towards HIV. The common grounds discussed for all the countries also present an excellent platform for comparison which can be beneficial for policy formulation.</p>
