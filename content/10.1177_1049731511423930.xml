<p>The editors thoughtfully crafted this book that addresses a critically important and timely professional and social issue that has plagued children and families served in child welfare (CW) nationwide, that is, there are disproportionately more African American (AA) and Native American (NA) children in CW systems than in their actual census population. Leading experts in the field provide a scholarly, comprehensive, and thorough examination of disproportionality and disparity within CW systems through 30 short, research-based, and readable chapters. The text is well organized into sections via data summary presentation, contexts, minority differences, and multiple ecological levels concluding with a useful resource section. The purpose of this text is to provide researchers, educators, practitioners, administrators, and policy makers an understanding of this serious conundrum, with examples that well illustrate disproportionality at multiple levels, as well as the need to involve the broader public to make informed decisions to improve outcomes for children and families. It is beyond the scope of this review to comment on each of the 30 chapters; thus, this review is organized by comments on each section of the book with selected examples from the chapters included in that section. All 30 chapters are well worth a good read and careful consideration of the issues discussed.</p>
<p>Section I <italic>, How Disproportionality and Disparities of Outcomes are Defined, Assessed, and Measured</italic>, includes six chapters. Susan Wells provides clarity for the whole book in the first chapter with definitions for disproportionality (with calculations) and disparity along with multiple tables analyzing racial disproportionality data along points in the CW system and poverty. Authors of Chapters 2 through 6, each present a study on disproportionality or disparities from neighborhood and community perspectives, to large county and state-level data reporting assessment and measurement methods, results, and implications. The Disparity Index to assess and measure disparity in CW is explained in Chapter 4, the Life Table Analysis by age in Chapter 5 improves cross-sectional analysis, as does cumulative disproportionality in Chapter 6 finding far more children are involved with the CW system than reported in cross-sectional studies.</p>
<p>In Chapters 7 through 11 comprising Section II, <italic>Contextualizing Disproportionality in Social Work</italic> the authors describe the historical context of disproportionality within social work. McRoy provides a set of constructive recommendations about the impact of poverty, stress, discrimination, and incarceration on AA families, which is multisystemic and requires a multisystemic and culturally competent solution. Important questions about differential representation within CW are followed by reflections on a <italic>universalization principle</italic> and cultural competence, and their importance in social work education and practice to reduce disproportionality in CW. Rivaux et al. found that when controlling for poverty and risk, race might be a deciding factor in CW decisions to provide in-home services or remove a child (fundamental attribution error). This section concludes with the historical context of disparity as minority children were excluded from and underrepresented in the CW system until the last half of the 20th century prior to integration.</p>
<p>Section III topics include <italic>Hispanic/Latino, Asian, American Indian, and Aboriginal Populations</italic>. Chapter 12 begins with the historical link of American Indian CW disproportionality to American colonialism and the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 to reduce the number of children removed from their families and tribes. Chapters 13–14 provide data and differences in rates by maltreatment type on Latino and Asian children underrepresented within CW systems and plausible expatiations. The final chapter in this section reports racial/ethnic differences in child protection services among Canadian minority, aboriginal, and Caucasian children.</p>
<p>
<italic>Addressing Disproportionality with Individual, Families, and Groups in Multiple Practice Settings</italic>, Chapters 16–22 in Section IV, Green frames reducing disproportionality within social work values via a successful community-based model in Texas. Additional strategies with supporting evidence presented include point of engagement in Compton, CA, use of a Racial Equity Scorecard in one Iowa county to track multisystemic changes over time, working with AA and NA youth and families in two Iowa counties, positive outcomes for AA children in kinship care settings, and residential care.</p>
<p>Section V, <italic>Addressing Disproportionality in Communities and Organizations</italic>, consists of eight chapters describing a variety of programs and training with positive outcomes at the macro level including data tables, results, and promising practices. Examples include an Indiana grassroots initiative spread statewide, the efforts of a church in rural Texas that lead to the adoption of 70 AA children, the results of the Casey Breakthrough Series Collaborative, a program that developed Disproportionality Specialists in Texas at both state and local levels, a critical review and evaluation of training focused on transfer of learning, efforts to engage the judicial system in King County (Seattle) and expanding national judicial initiatives.</p>
<p>The final Section, <italic>Resources</italic>, provides additional materials with information on how to easily access these. Part A lists the Children’s Bureau’s Resource centers for training and technical assistance with contact information. Part B provides information on legislation and organization websites for AA disproportionality. American Indian and Alaska Native children disproportionality resources comprise Part C. Training related to disproportionality and disparity in CW resources are included in Part D.</p>
<p>
<italic>Challenging Racial Disproportionality in Child Welfare</italic> is a must read. Students, educators, researchers, practitioners, administrators, and policy makers can be greatly informed by reading this book. It portends to be a valuable resource for social work curricula such as cultural diversity, human behavior in the social environment, CW, policy, and research courses, and in training for new and experienced CW employees. This text could also be used for continuing education for educators, substance abuse, health and mental health professionals because clients served in the CW system are also engaged through these systems. I am pleased to have the opportunity to review this timely and important book. I believe it will be widely read as it contains rich resources for discussing complex issues in our culture in general, and more specifically in CW.</p>
