<abstract><title>Summary</title>
<p>Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) infections continue to be among the most common and unrecognized sexually transmitted infections in the world. Although treatable, HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections remain incurable. Hence, there is interest in the development of a vaccine to prevent genital herpes. As part of a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test such a vaccine, healthy women 18–30 years were enrolled as volunteers in several Canadian centres between 2005 and 2007. This study reports the seroprevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies in this group. A total of 2694 adult female volunteers in Canada with no known history of herpes simplex were screened for HSV antibodies using Western blot assay (the gold standard for diagnosis of HSV) for potential participation in a randomized, double-blind efficacy field trial of a herpes simplex vaccine. This trial provides a unique opportunity to examine the prevalence of antibodies to HSV-1 and of antibodies to HSV-2 in women with no known history of herpes simplex infection. The prevalence of antibodies to HSV-1 and to HSV-2 is compared with that found in previous Canadian studies that focused on a more general population. The overall seroprevalence of antibody to HSV-1 was 43%; that of HSV-2 was 2.5% and seropositivity to both was 2%. The prevalence of antibody to both HSV-1 and to HSV-2 increased with age. Seronegativity to both HSV-1 and HSV-2 was 56% in participating centres with populations under 250,000 and 46% in participating centres with populations over 250,000. Significant racial differences in seropositivity to HSV-1 and to HSV-2 were noted. The likelihood of participants being seropositive to HSV-1 and to HSV-2 was found to increase with age and to positively correlate with the population of the city in which they resided. Hypotheses are proposed to account for differences in racial seropositivity to HSV-1 and to HSV-2.</p>

<p>Despite major advances in antimicrobial therapy, herpes simplex virus (HSV) remains one of the most common of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in North America. Several studies in Canada have examined seroprevalence of HSV infection in general populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956462412472822">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956462412472822"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956462412472822">3</xref></sup> and in specific populations including HIV-infected patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956462412472822">4</xref></sup> STI clinic patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956462412472822">5</xref></sup> neonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956462412472822">6</xref></sup> and in pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956462412472822">7</xref></sup> In a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956462412472822">1</xref></sup> in which data were collected from public health laboratories in Ontario from March 2000 to January 2001 age-adjusted seroprevalence of HSV-1 antibodies in women not under prenatal care ranged from 32% in women 15–16 years of age to 89% in women 40–44 years of age. In this same study, the overall age-standardized seroprevalence of HSV-2 antibodies was 9.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1–5.4).</p>
<p>Genital HSV infection is associated with a higher risk of HIV acquisition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956462412472822">8</xref></sup> neonatal herpes, meningitis/encephalitis and ocular herpes. While the risk of such complications is low the psychological impact of infection/infectivity remains high.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956462412472822">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study examines the subset of data collected at Canadian trial centres for the purpose of screening of volunteers for participation in a trial of an investigational HSV vaccine (see clinicaltrials.gov NCT00057330)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956462412472822">10</xref></sup> and is representative of a cohort of women with no known history of orolabial and/or genital HSV infection.</p>

<sec id="sec2a"><title>Vaccine efficacy study</title>
<p>The Herpevac Trial for Women was a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial conducted during which subjects were enrolled between 2003 and 2007. This trial was co-sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and GlaxoSmithKline in collaboration with a scientific group. All participants signed an ethics board-approved informed consent form and had serum tested for antibody to both HSV-1 and HSV-2. Participants who had neither HSV-1 nor HSV-2 antibody and who met other enrolment criteria were then invited to participate in the field study of an investigational HSV vaccine.</p>
<p>This paper reports HSV antibody seroprevalence determined from the initial screening data collected in participating Canadian centres. These data represent the largest study conducted in Canada on HSV antibody seroprevalence specifically in women ages 18–30 with no known history of HSV infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956462412472822">10</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec2b"><title>Study population</title>
<p>Healthy women with no history of HSV disease were screened for potential enrolment in the Herpevac Trial at 10 centres in Canada from 2005 to 2007. Participating centres were in Quebec, Alberta, Nova Scotia, British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario, and included university sites as well as dedicated research facilities. Women screened were 18–30 years of age at the time of vaccination were recruited through a variety of methods. The majority of participants were recruited using methods that included:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Screening of participating clinicians’ own patients;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Posters placed in the participating sites’ community including in university/college health clinics, planned parenthood, newspapers, employment classified ads, public transit, libraries, community centres, restaurants and pharmacies;</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Fliers in universities/colleges describing the scope of HSV and the trial.</p></list-item>
</list>Participants were provided with a reimbursement of study costs including travel costs to and from the clinic. Participants had to be willing not to become pregnant during the vaccination period. Information on the particular mode of recruitment of individual participants, of education level and of socioeconomic status were not collected. Participants were excluded if they had self-reported clinical signs or symptoms of HSV disease, had a history of herpes simplex, were taking any immunosuppressive medication, had an immune compromising or other significant illness, received blood or blood products within three months of study entry, had a positive or indeterminate result on HSV Western blot testing or had any sexually transmitted infection within the previous 30 days.</p>

<p>Western blot analysis was performed for all participating sites in both the USA and Canada at University of Washington Clinical Virology Laboratory at Seattle Children's Hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956462412472822">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956462412472822"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956462412472822"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956462412472822"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956462412472822"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956462412472822">16</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec2d"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Age at study entry was calculated using date of birth and screening date, and categorized into three age groups (17–22, 23–26 and 27–30 years). Race and ethnicity were self-described by participants. Race category ‘other’ includes American Indian/Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander races. More Canadian-specific data on surveillance categories (e.g. Asian, East Asian, specific aboriginal groups, etc.) were not collected as this had originally been a US-based clinical trial. Population estimates were determined based on the 2001 Canadian Census. HSV screening results are classified into five antibody profiles (HSV1+/HSV2−, HSV1−/HSV2+, HSV1+/HSV2+, HSV1−/HSV2− or indeterminate), and summarized using percentages and 95% confidence intervals. The relationship between HSV antibody seroprevalence and age was observed to be approximately linear (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956462412472822">1</xref>). For each age stratum the mean prevalence of each virus type was calculated and then weighted linear regression models were fit to estimate the trend between prevalence for each type and age, with weights to account for the different number of subjects at each centre.

<sec id="sec3b"><title>HSV-1 seroprevalence</title>
<p>Overall HSV-1 antibody seroprevalence was 45% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956462412472822">1</xref>). Seropositivity was found to be highest in Hispanic (82%) followed by black (69%) women.</p>
<p>HSV-1 antibody seroprevalence increased with age from the lowest age group (17–22 years) at 41% to the highest age group (27–30 years) at 51% (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956462412472822">1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec3d"><title>Relationship to city size</title>
<p>The odds of having antibodies to HSV-1 were higher in Canadian cities with population ≥250,000 (odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95%, CI 1.2–1.9), consistent with the relationship observed in the full screening cohort including Canadian and US centres. In the full screening cohort, a similar relationship was found between HSV-2 antibodies and city size (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4–1.7), but the association was not significant when restricted to Canadian centres (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.8–2.2).</p>

<sec id="sec4"><title>INTERPRETATION/DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The screening data collected in the Herpevac Trial provide the largest HSV seroprevalence data-set collected in Canada to date. Unlike previous studies examining seroprevalence in certain provinces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956462412472822">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956462412472822">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956462412472822">7</xref></sup> the Herpevac Trial data examines the seroprevalence of antibodies to HSV-1 and to HSV-2 in six provinces across Canada using the same assay. It is reflective of a common clinical scenario: that of an asymptomatic 18–30-year-old woman with no known history of herpes requesting counselling around the risk of having acquired genital herpes.</p>
<p>A major limitation of this and other seroprevalence studies is the inability of serological testing for HSV to identify the site of the infection and that the majority of the HSV-1 infections could be oral herpes infections.</p>
<p>A second limitation is the possibility of selection bias due to the voluntary nature of the study. That is, these subjects did not represent a random sample of the population.</p>
<p>Risk of HSV acquisition begins at birth. A longitudinal serological study in 2007<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956462412472822">17</xref></sup> found that at age 30 months 30% of children were found to be HSV-1 positive in a cohort in whom the maternal seroprevalence for HSV-1 was 65%. This suggestion that HSV-1 is transmitted primarily from parent to child has been replicated in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956462412472822">18</xref></sup> In addition to maternal seropositivity, early childhood stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956462412472822">19</xref></sup> lower family income, lower parental education and non-white race/ethnicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956462412472822">20</xref></sup> are associated with increased prevalence rates of antibody to HSV-1.</p>
<p>During adolescent years there is a clear trend showing an increasing proportion of genital herpes caused by HSV-1 possibly due to increasing oral-genital sex. This trend has been shown in British Columbia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956462412472822">21</xref></sup> Nova Scotia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956462412472822">22</xref></sup> and the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956462412472822">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956462412472822">24</xref></sup> Simply being female in a heterosexual relationship with a male has been identified as risk factor for HSV acquisition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956462412472822">25</xref></sup> Moreover, an association of HSV infection with other sexually transmitted infections including HIV and hepatitis C has been documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956462412472822">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The data in the cohort presented were collected for the Herpevac Trial; this trial enrolled participants between 14 January 2005 and 19 November 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956462412472822">10</xref></sup> In this cohort, as in previous trials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956462412472822">26</xref></sup> the likelihood of participants being seropositive to HSV-1 and to HSV-2 was found to increase with age and number of sexual contacts.</p>
<p>However, somewhat more surprising was the finding that the prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibody positively correlated with the population of the city where the subject was screened. This finding was observed for participating centers in the USA as well as in Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956462412472822">10</xref></sup> Eight Canadian centres with a total of 472 participants were in cities with populations under 250,000 according to Canadian Census data of 2001.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956462412472822">27</xref></sup> The Canadian data alone did not reach statistical significance for seropositivity to HSV-2; however, when combined with the data from centers in smaller US cities this association became more evident. Several factors may be attributing to this association. These include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Cities with larger populations have greater numbers of minorities, some of whom may have higher seroprevalence of HSV-1 or HSV-2 antibodies;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Changing demographic patterns – the Canadian data were collected in 2003–2005; Canadian census data were collected in 2001;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Participating Canadian centres were in cities with fewer Hispanics than were US centres;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There may be differences in sexual practices among specific populations between study sites.</p></list-item>
</list>In theory, the combined overall high seropositivity observed in this population should have the effect of lessening the social and sexual stigma around herpes simplex infection. Indeed, antibody to HSV-1 is so common that its presence in a sense re-defines ‘normalcy.’ Because serological testing cannot identify the site of infection, it is likely that much of the HSV-1 seroprevalence represents oral herpes (‘cold sores’) rather than genital HSV. Thus, serological testing is not particularly useful in diagnosing genital HSV.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this data-set underestimates overall HSV seroprevalence since those with a known history of HSV were specifically excluded from screening. This underestimate may be somewhat compensated by the fact that subjects may have been motivated to participate because of a possible past exposure to HSV-2 as was demonstrated in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956462412472822">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet significant challenges in counselling affected patients remain. The health care worker endeavoring to counsel an affected patient by citing high seroprevalence in the general population risks being viewed as insensitive to the patient's personal experience of the disease. Furthermore, 70% of HSV infection is transmitted in the asymptomatic state with up to 90% of those with HSV infection unaware of their status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956462412472822">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956462412472822">20</xref></sup> Individuals infected with genital herpes shed unpredictably and sporadically regardless of their symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956462412472822">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Canadian guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956462412472822">30</xref></sup> state that ‘type specific serological testing for HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 antibody can demonstrate whether couples are discordant or concordant for HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 infection’ and that ‘such information will be useful in counselling couples about the risk of transmission of genital herpes infection’. That said, none of the Canadian laboratories that offer type-specific serology for HSV recommend the use of these tests for general screening. Rather, Canadian laboratories provide specific indications for the use of the tests. Suggested indications include potential screening of pregnant women with a partner with known genital HSV or screening individuals with atypical lesions.</p>
<p>The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) defines a broader subset of patients in whom serological testing may be of value including its utility in patients where there is a suspicion of clinical genital herpes but in whom viral identification tests cannot be performed or are negative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956462412472822">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, US professional organizations’ screening recommendations differ. Currently, the US Preventative Screening Task Force, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Family Physicians do not recommend serological screening for HSV-1 or HSV-2 in the general population but suggest that ‘type-specific HSV serological assays might be useful in the following scenarios: (1) recurrent genital symptoms or atypical symptoms with negative HSV cultures; (2) a clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory confirmation; or (3) a partner with genital herpes. HSV serological testing should be considered for persons presenting for an STI evaluation (especially for those persons with multiple sex partners), persons with HIV infection and men who have sex with men at increased risk for HIV acquisition’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956462412472822">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet complications of HSV can be significant and rarely, potentially fatal. The most common complications are psychosocial complications. These include anxiety, depression, loneliness, low self-esteem, fear of transmission and fear of being judged/rejected by partners.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956462412472822">9</xref></sup> While uncommon, herpes simplex infection can be devastating including increasing risk of HIV acquisition, congenital and neonatal complications (5.9 cases per 100,000 live-births<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956462412472822">6</xref></sup>), meningitis/encephalitis and keratitis (11.8 cases per 100,000 people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956462412472822">33</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>The available options to reduce transmission of genital HSV infections remain condoms and suppressive antiviral therapy.</p>
<p>HSV remains an incurable infection with significant risk of complications, social stigma and anxiety. Further research is needed into prevention and treatment. In a review of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine acceptability, it was found that ‘the majority of research studies to date indicate that young women, parents and health-care providers are interested in vaccines that prevent HPV and other sexually transmitted infections’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956462412472822">34</xref></sup> The ultimate general acceptance of the HPV and hepatitis B vaccinations is encouraging. Given that the majority of parents and their adolescent children find STI vaccination acceptable,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956462412472822">35</xref></sup> and in particular vaccination against genital herpes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0956462412472822">36</xref></sup> it is imperative that continued efforts be made in the development of an effective vaccine against herpes simplex virus.</p>
