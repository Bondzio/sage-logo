<abstract>
<p>This article explores the impact of practitioners’ attitudes and knowledge of sexual health on clinical behaviors. Sexual health topics are often areas of concern for clients of any age in counseling. Thus, counselors must be trained and equipped to address sexual health across the life span. This study explored whether child and adolescent clinical mental health staff’s attitudes and knowledge of sexual health predicted their clinical behaviors. Results indicated that the practitioners’ attitudes about sexual health, not their sexual health knowledge level, predicted whether or not they addressed sexual health with clients. Implications and suggestions for counselors and counselor educators are provided.</p>

<p>A defining characteristic of counselor educators is that they counsel individuals, couples, and families using a developmental approach. According to the current standards of the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP), counselors in training must receive instruction in a variety of life course issues to best serve their client population (Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480711430196">CACREP], 2009</xref>). Interventions often deal with a plethora of diverse social and developmental issues including ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, family values, spiritual, and religious values, relationships, grief, loss, and how these issues interface with the unique characteristics of individuals, couples, and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480711430196">CACREP, 2009</xref>). In the new CACREP counseling standards, all counselors must possess knowledge and “understand(s) human sexuality and its impact on the family” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480711430196">CACREP, 2009</xref>, p. 36). Despite, this declaration, it remains unclear as to what training counselors are receiving and how they are addressing these issues in clinical settings. This oversight can have dire consequences on a client’s self-esteem, overall health status, sexual development, interpersonal relationships, as well as successful mental health treatment outcomes.</p>
<p>Most practitioners would agree that sexual issues are woven into the fabric of society and are often related to many of the social and public health concerns that are addressed in counseling settings today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711430196">di Mauro, 1995</xref>). Despite the vast existence of issues that present in clinical settings, how sexual health is handled by practitioners in clinical practice often remains a mystery. This research sought to address how counseling practitioners’ attitudes and knowledge of sexual health interface with their clinical behaviors in one specific niche of practice, child, and adolescent mental health. An overview of what constitutes sexual health, how it appears in clinical practice, and why it is an important area for which counselors must be aware is addressed.</p>
<sec id="section1-1066480711430196">
<title>Sexual Health Defined</title>
<p>In the United States, the term sexual health is often used interchangeably with sexuality (World Health Organization [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480711430196">WHO], 2004</xref>). However, when pondering what sexuality in the life course means, it is often limited to characteristics such as whether or not a person is heterosexual, participates in “normalized” sexual behaviors, and with whom they choose (or do not choose) to partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711430196">Giami, 2002</xref>). Sexual health is more than sexuality; it is an ecological phenomenon with many layers of complexity. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480711430196">WHO (2004)</xref>,<disp-quote>
<p>Sexual health is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being related to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled. (p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote>This conceptualization of sexual health provides a biopsychosocial model of sexual health that allows for diversity and personalization of one’s sexual identity, orientation, and behaviors as distinct characteristics from one another that can assist counselors in developing a deeper understanding of the complexities of sexual health issues with clients.</p>
<p>In order to fully understand sexual health, counselors need to comprehend not only sexual functioning, the occurrence or absence of disease, and sexual activity choices, but also how sociocultural factors such as poverty, gender roles, sexual identity, access to care, and education impact one’s sexual self. When sexual health problems occur, individuals and even communities can encounter emotional and psychological distress that in turn affects relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480711430196">Leiblum &amp; Rosen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480711430196">Wincze &amp; Carey, 1991</xref>). This distress, coupled with the often conflicting influence of the media where individuals experience “confusion between what is portrayed and what they have experienced,” is an area of which counselors must be made cognizant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480711430196">Gray, Cummins, Johnson, &amp; Mason, 1989</xref>, p. 305) and be equipped to assess.</p>

<title>The Importance of Knowledge and Addressing Sexual Health in Counseling</title>
<p>Researchers and academics agree that sexual health is an important topic in the counseling profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711430196">Gray, House, &amp; Eicken, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480711430196">Sansone &amp; Wiederman, 2000</xref>); and yet it remains unclear as to the importance placed upon sexual health in counseling sessions by practitioners. Are counselors knowledgable about sexual issues, what are their attitudes toward addressing these topics, and what education do they have that prepares one to address these topics in practice? It has been suggested that sexual health is often considered an ancillary topic in graduate education programs rather than a developmental life course issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711430196">Gray et al., 1995</xref>). Training is excluded in formal study because sexual health is deemed a “natural” phenomenon that does not need explanation or teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480711430196">Sansone &amp; Wiederman, 2000</xref>). Thus, it may not be surprising that counseling practitioners may find addressing sexual health topics in an open and honest manner to be difficult due to the complex nature of these topics and lack of training.</p>
<p>The study of sexual health by mental health providers has the potential to inform educators’ and counselors’ understanding of sexual issues for the development of clinical skills and for the betterment of clients. The ability of counselors to identify sexual health as a developmental issue, to be comfortable addressing this issue, and to work with clients to understand their bodies and sexual development as regular human processes serves to further an understanding and acknowledgment of sexual health factors that might be associated with other mental health issues they are experiencing. This understanding of sexual health and how it may be similar to or different from a client’s sense of sexual health derives in part from an acknowledgment of the myriad of factors and characteristics that have been indicated through research to be associated with sexual health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711430196">Cort, Attenborough, &amp; Watson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711430196">di Mauro, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480711430196">Edwards &amp; Coleman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711430196">Giami, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480711430196">WHO, 2004</xref>). Counselors who are prepared with this knowledge and understanding of the importance of basic sexual health competencies will be able to address client’s questions and concerns about sexual decision making without projecting shame, awkwardness, or misinformation regarding sexual development and health.</p>
<sec id="section3-1066480711430196">
<title>Addressing Sexual Health With Children and Adults</title>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480711430196">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2002)</xref>, one in every five young people at any given time are affected by mental health problems, with approximately only one third of those receiving the mental health treatment they need. Little to no research exists on the interface of sexual health and mental health issues in child mental health services, though it would be remiss not to discuss the implications of addressing sexual health in counseling specifically with children and adolescents. Addressing sexual health topics with young people can invoke a host of reactions from parents, clients, and practitioners alike. Because of the lack of training in this specific area, it is not surprising that counselors have anxiety about addressing these topics in practice in part because they have not been prepared to do so. It is relatively unknown how often sexual issues appear in the counseling setting with this population, how counselors handle sexual topics, and whether or not they feel competent in addressing them, though the topics that counselors encounter in clinical settings are known. For example, seven of the ten adolescents have had sexual intercourse by the time they turn 19 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711430196">Abma, Martinez, Mosher, &amp; Dawson, 2010</xref>); people aged 15–24 represent only one quarter of the sexually active population, but they account for almost half (9.1 million) of new sexually transmissible infections each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066480711430196">Weinstock, Berman, &amp; Cates, 2004</xref>); and it has been suggested that there is a direct relationship between the frequency of childhood sexual behaviors and sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711430196">Kendall-Tackett, Williams, &amp; Finkelhor, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>It is imperative for counselors to know about appropriate versus inappropriate sexual behaviors in childhood in order to prevent victimization of children as well as future mental health crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480711430196">Thanasiu, 2004</xref>). The Division of Child Abuse and Domestic Violence Services (2005) indicated that early victimization from sexual abuse or assault places persons at an increased risk of psychological problems. One study suggested that 70% of females in a psychiatric emergency room sample were abuse survivors, and 51% of state hospital patients were sexually abused during childhood or adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480711430196">Division of Child Abuse and Domestic Violence Services, 2005</xref>). Additionally, estimates indicated that only 25–50% of rape and child sexual abuse survivors receive some form of mental health treatment as a result of the victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711430196">Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1998</xref>). Child and adult histories of sexual and physical abuse appeared frequently to be the first experience in a sequence that leads to homelessness for both women and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480711430196">Anderson &amp; Chiocchio, 1997</xref>). Although many of these statistics pertain to adult populations, they indicate the enormity and complexity of sexual health concerns that can arise in mental health treatment for children and adolescents as practitioners are made more aware of the prevalence of sexually related trauma in childhood.</p>

<title>Attitudes and Knowledge of Sexual Health</title>
<p>Few studies to date have addressed counseling professionals’ attitudes and beliefs about sexual health in clinical practice. In fact, the majority of available research and literature focuses on allied health professionals’ beliefs, specifically nurses, rather than counselors and mental health practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711430196">Lewis &amp; Bor, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711430196">McKelvey, Webb, Baldassar, Robinson, &amp; Riley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480711430196">Webb, 1987</xref>). Important to note though due to similarity in training and scope of practice, these findings may also be applicable to other allied health professionals including counselors and counselor educators. It has been suggested in the nursing literature that practitioners who are less knowledgable about sexual health are less likely to address sexual health issues with clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711430196">Lewis &amp; Bor, 1994</xref>). Additionally, practitioners with negative attitudes about addressing sexual issues with clients often have lower sexual knowledge in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711430196">McKelvey et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480711430196">Webb, 1987</xref>). Data from these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711430196">Lewis &amp; Bor, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711430196">McKelvey et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480711430196">Webb, 1987</xref>) suggested that lower levels of sexual health knowledge (SHK) may actually prevent practitioners from addressing sexual health issues with clients and that, “attitudes are regarded as major barriers to prevent open discussion” of sexually related topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711430196">Cort et al., 2001</xref>, p. 489). In the above studies, practitioners were aware of sexual issues but indicated that they do not know how to address them in clinical settings for fear of being intrusive (Bor &amp; Watts, 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711430196">Guthrie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480711430196">Kautz, Dickey, &amp; Stevens, 1990</xref>). Nursing practitioners indicated that clients do not want them to ask about sexual concerns for fear of making clients uncomfortable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711430196">Reynolds &amp; Magnan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480711430196">Waterhouse &amp; Metcalf, 1991</xref>). In a study of multiple disciplines, mental health practitioners (including counselors and social workers) were the least willing and had the lowest comfort level in discussing sexual issues with clients in a health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480711430196">Harboubi &amp; Lincoln, 2003</xref>). In addition, most of this sample (86%), regardless of discipline, had sexual health-related training, and the majority (94%) did not address sexual concerns with patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480711430196">Harboubi &amp; Lincoln, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The main purpose of this article is to explore the relationship of practitioners’ attitudes and knowledge of sexual health with their clinical behaviors with the following hypotheses:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> Individuals serving children and adolescents who perceive fewer barriers to addressing sexual health will have higher knowledge scores of sexual health.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1066480711430196">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were purposively selected and consisted of clinical staff (counselors, social workers, art therapists, and direct care workers) working in a mental health agency that serves children and adolescents in and around a medium size urban center located in the Northeastern United States. All participants spent at least half of their work time directly with clients. One hundred and seventy-five participants were given the surveys, with a total of 158 surveys returned.</p>
<p>Participants were all at least 21 years, employed by the agency, of varying race or ethnicity (White, Black, Latino/Latina, Asian, American Indian, or Biracial), represented a diversity of educational levels, had differing job titles, and varying lengths of employment within the agency. Participation in the survey was voluntary and answers were kept anonymous.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1066480711430196">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>For this research study, three instruments were used to gather data regarding various aspects of sexual health within clinical practice. Data were collected at selected departmental meetings assigned by the agency training and personnel director. The three survey questionnaire instruments included a survey pertaining to staff attitudes and beliefs, one regarding sexual knowledge, and a demographic questionnaire that included training in sexuality and current clinical behaviors/actions with clients.</p>
<p>The Sexuality Attitude and Beliefs Survey (SABS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711430196">Reynolds &amp; Morris, 2005</xref>) gathered information regarding staff attitudes about addressing sexual health and perceived barriers in clinical practice. This instrument rated participants as conservative (were not likely to discuss sexual health or perceived too many barriers that thwarted sexual health discussions) or liberal (were more likely to discuss sexual health, or perceived fewer, or were able to overcome, barriers to discussing sexual health matters) using a Likert-type scale format. This instrument was an internally consistent measure of barriers to incorporating sexual health in assessment with Cronbach’s α’s of .75 to .82 ( <italic>p</italic> ≤ .02; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711430196">Reynolds &amp; Morris, 2005</xref>). For purposes of this study, 13 items (12 original questions and 1 researcher added) were presented in a Likert-type scale format (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>; 6 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Scores on this measure range from 0 to 65, with higher scores indicating perceiving fewer barriers to addressing sexual issues with clients.</p>
<p>Knowledge level pertained to clinical staff knowledge of basic sexual health information including reproduction, sexually transmissible illnesses, and physical/biological factors using a SHK instrument. This instrument was created by this author using current statistics and data sources regarding sexual health. The instrument was reviewed by three experts in sexual health treatment and education for face validity. Five additional mental health service workers completed the measure and commented on wording. This measure included 24 items and all questions had multiple choice answers with only one answer being correct.</p>
<p>Another researcher created a questionnaire to obtain demographic information from all participants including age, gender, length of employment as at the agency, length of time in profession, among others. This measure was also reviewed by the same three experts in the field of sexual health for face validity and completed by the five mental health service workers, none of whom were included in the final sample. Questions pertaining to client population served were also included. Finally, questions about practitioner behaviors including how often sexual health issues are addressed with clients, the practitioners’ values regarding sexual health in clinical practice, training, and practitioners’ perceptions of outside influences on sexual health decision making in clinical practice were included.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1066480711430196">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Clinical staff members working at a mental health facility that serves children and adolescents were asked to participate in completing surveys for this research. Each participant read the consent form and all procedures followed those established by the Institutional Review Board of the University associated with this study. Participants were given the surveys consisting of sexual health attitudes, knowledge, training, and clinical behaviors at the end of a randomly chosen departmental monthly meeting. The researcher obtained a randomly generated list of clinical staff departmental meetings the participating agency from which to gather data. Departmental leaders were contacted via an e-mail or a phone to set up times to attend meetings to administer surveys. At the meetings, practitioners and direct care staff were asked to complete the questionnaires that required approximately 30 min.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section10-1066480711430196">
<title>Descriptive Data</title>
<p>To evaluate the hypotheses, a series of analyses were conducted including descriptive statistics, correlations, and a logistic regression. The overall response rate was 158 participants completing the survey of the 179 possible participants, which was an 88.3% return rate. Descriptive statistics utilizing statistical package for the social sciences 16.0 (statistical package for the social sciences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480711430196">[SPSS] Inc., 2008</xref>) were conducted. The participant pool consisted of 99 females (62.7%) and 52 males (32.9%), with 7 (4.4%) nonresponders. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 66, with the average employee age of 30. The mean length of employment was approximately 3.5 years at the agency.</p>
<p>The majority of the 158 participants were Caucasian (78.5%) and the remaining were African American (8.2%), Hispanic/Latino (2.5%), Asian (1.3%), and Other/Nonresponder (9.5%). Approximately 84 (53%) of the participants had master’s degrees, 36 (22.8%) had bachelor degrees, and 27 (17.1%) had either an associate degree, were working on or did not have a college degree.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1066480711430196">
<title>Hypothesis 1</title>
<p>The first hypothesis predicted that individuals serving children and adolescents who perceived fewer barriers to addressing sexual health would have higher knowledge scores. Total SABS scores ranged from 17 to 49 (<italic>M</italic> = 31.68, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.99) with higher scores indicating more barriers to including client sexuality into clinical practice. To obtain basic levels of practitioner and direct care staff knowledge of sexual health matters, a sexual knowledge scale (SKS) was utilized. A 28 question SHK survey of multiple choice and true/false questions was created. The range of correct answers was 11–24. The mean for the SHK was 19.19 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.61). This hypothesis was tested using the SABS and was correlated with the SKS using a Spearman correlation coefficient. Results of the correlation indicated that there was a statistically significant, indirect association between these two variables, <italic>r</italic> = −.702; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Thus, as a participant’s SHK increased, the degree of perceived barriers to actually addressing sexual health decreased.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1066480711430196">
<title>Hypothesis 2</title>
<p>The second hypothesis predicted that individuals serving children and adolescents and who have higher knowledge scores of sexual health and less restrictive attitudes (perceived fewer barriers) were more likely to include sexual health topics in their practice. To test the hypothesis, a hierarchical regression was conducted. Regression analysis was performed to examine whether the effects of sexual attitudes and sexual knowledge on clinical sexual behaviors differ across groups of practitioners based on specific demographic characteristics. The total behavior score (TBS) was obtained by adding together scores for demographic variables regarding participant reported behavior of whether or not they address sexual health with clients. A higher score on this measure indicated that a person was more likely to address sexual health matters with clients. The range of correct answers was 0–12 with a mean of 6.45 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.588).</p>
<p>In this section, covariates were separated and placed into a hierarchical design for analysis. Correlational statistics were conducted and several covariates were then excluded from the data due to multicollinearity. Variables with correlations higher than .65 were excluded from the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480711430196">Stevens, 2002</xref>). Independent variables (<italic>X</italic>) were gender, age of participant, race, marital status, level of education (degree), religion, age of clients served, length of employment, total SABS score, and total SKS score. The dependent variable (<italic>Y</italic>) was TBS.</p>
<p>Statistics indicated that in Model 1 of the regression, the adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> was .183, suggesting that the four predictors accounted for 18.3% of the variance in <italic>Y</italic> (behavior score). Model 2 of the regression equation indicated an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of .332 when controlling for the second step of covariates including, degree (education level), age of participant, race, and marital status. Thus, .332 − .183 = .149, or an additional 14.9% variance in behavior score when controlling for the demographic variables in the first step of the regression equation (gender, age of participant, race, and marital status). In Model 3, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> was .634.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study assessed practitioners’ knowledge and attitudes of sexual health who work with children and adolescents and whether or not they address sexual health topics with clients. Because historically sexual health has been overlooked in the research agendas of many counselor education and mental health preparatory programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480711430196">Edwards &amp; Coleman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711430196">Gray et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480711430196">Sansone &amp; Wiederman, 2000</xref>), how and if practitioners address these issues is suspect at best. While researchers and academics agree that sexual health is an important topic in the counseling profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711430196">Gray et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480711430196">Sansone &amp; Wiederman, 2000</xref>), it remains unclear as what barriers practitioners perceive to addressing sexual health-related topics in clinical settings, whether or not they are competent in addressing these topics with clients, their knowledge about sexual health, and if they actually address these issues in clinical settings. Thus, understanding what prevents practitioners from actually addressing sexual health issues in an open, honest manner is paramount to increasing appropriate educational opportunities and decreasing their perceived barriers.</p>
<p>One of the expected findings was that individuals who perceived fewer barriers to addressing sexual health had higher knowledge scores, which concurs with existing literature that there is a statistically significant relationship between attitudes toward sexual health and knowledge of sexual health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711430196">Reynolds &amp; Magnan, 2005</xref>). As expected, as a practitioner’s SHK increased, the number of barriers they perceived decreased. There are many possible ways to increase SHK among practitioners such as encouraging additional course work pertaining to sexual health be created at the graduate level of training, additional continuing education and agency-based trainings for furthering knowledge, and specific sexual health-based supervision. Findings of this study suggest that by becoming more knowledgeable about sexual issues, practitioners may be able to decrease their perceived barriers, which in turn may allow them to become more comfortable with addressing sexual health with clients.</p>
<p>Discussing sexual health topics with children has a set of unique challenges for clinicians. It is common for parents to be faced with their child’s sexual exploration and curiosity, and express concern about how to handle these situations. Often, it is then that parents turn to clinicians to assist in addressing these issues clinically. Clinicians must be prepared to discuss these topics with great sensitivity and yet openness. In this study, clinician’s attitude toward addressing sexual health was the greatest predictor of whether or not they would in fact talk about sexual issues with children. This is not a surprising finding, but it does highlight that if clinicians are receiving education and are not open to addressing sexual health, some clients are being deprived of discussing an important health-related issue. The range of sexual health issues clinicians will encounter vary by age of the clients, community in which they work, socioeconomic status of clients, the availability of services, and the time and fit of clients’ needs to the agency and practitioner. It is likely that clinicians will encounter many young people who are sexually active, have sexual identity and development concerns, have families who disagree about their sexual identity and sexual orientation, are pregnant, have Sexually Transmissible Infections (STIs), have been sexually abused, possess body image concerns, had multiple sex partners, and/or use pornography on a regular basis, to name a few. If clinicians are not open to addressing these issues, they will not. This can be a grave oversight for clients and clinicians alike.</p>

<title>Implications for Counselors and Counselor Educators</title>
<p>The results of this study have several implications for counseling and mental health practitioners. It was indicated that a person’s perceived barriers was the most indicative factor regarding whether or not they addressed sexual health issues in their work. Although SHK was important, level of SHK was not predictive of whether or not sexual health was addressed with clients. This research supports the need for additional training to ascertain what the perceived barriers to addressing sexual health are, how they can be challenged, and how counselors can develop skills to effectively address sexual health in an appropriate manner. Additionally, specific training in the areas of addressing sexual health with children and adolescents must be included in graduate studies, continuing education and supervisory training to ensure that the mental health and sexual health concerns are addressed effectively in clinical practice.</p>
<p>The study of sexual health among clinical providers has the potential to inform educators’ and counselors’ understanding of sexual issues for the development of clinical skills and for the betterment of clients. The ability of counselors to identify sexual health as a developmental issue, to be comfortable addressing this issue, and to work with clients to understand their body and sexual development as regular human processes serve to further an understanding and acknowledgment of sexual health factors that might be associated with other mental health issues they are experiencing. This understanding of sexual health and how it may be similar or different from a client’s sense of sexual health derives in part from an understanding of the myriad factors and characteristics that have been shown through research to be associated with sexual health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711430196">di Mauro, 1995</xref>). Counselors who are prepared with this knowledge and understanding of the importance of basic sexual health competencies will be able to address clients’ questions and concerns about sexual decision making without projecting shame, displaying awkwardness, or providing incorrect information regarding sexual development and health. In addition, clinicians will be confident in their knowledge of sexual health and be competent in addressing parental as well as child concerns related to sexual issues.</p>
<p>In order to understand how a person views and treats one’s sexual life, it is imperative that practitioners assess this aspect of human development across a broad spectrum of beliefs, attitudes, actions, knowledge acquisition, and in relationship to self and others. This study concurs with past research that indicates a lack of publications and program evaluations to ascertain what is actually being taught by institutions and in academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480711430196">Wincze &amp; Carey, 1991</xref>). Practitioners appear to be relying heavily upon their own beliefs and values to address sexual health rather than their training or a best practice method. Additional self-exploration of sexual health beliefs can counteract perceived barriers that practitioners hold in order to better serve clients. Although the ultimate responsibility for discussing personal matters such as sexual health might rest with the client, counselors must be comfortable with asking culturally sensitive, gender neutral questions to empower their clients and provide resources to promote health. As the focus of mental health and sexual health continue to diverge from the medical and disease model of pathology, it is important for counselors to conceptualize sexual health in a positive, holistic, and biopsychosocial manner for effective change to occur.</p>
