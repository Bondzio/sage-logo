<p>Manuela Bojadžijev’s study aims to elaborate upon a theoretical approach different from the objectiveness and piles of figures existing for mainstream research on migrants and migrant integration. Bojadžijev investigates the inclusion of migrants in post-war Germany not as an accommodation process arranged by the receiving society but as a multi-faceted social struggle carried out by the migrants, one capable of transforming both the receiving society and dominant understandings regarding international migration. The movement of people is thus construed not as a spatial transition but rather as a social protest.</p>
<p>The core of this struggle, theoretically analysed and engagingly enacted in Bojadžijev’s book, culminates in the question: How is anti-racist thinking, speech and action possible without getting entangled in identity ascriptions of racism? This question is based upon the presumption that racism results from and is embodied in social relations between persons, groups and institutions (in this case of a receiving state and immigrants) and that struggles against racism are part of the ensemble of social relations that produce and reproduce racism. Bojadžijev’s answer to this major question follows two tacks, the first being what the author calls a ‘relational theory of racism’ (<italic>relationale Theorie des Rassismus</italic>), the second being a historiographical reconstruction of the ‘struggles of migration’ (<italic>Kämpfe der Migration</italic>). Both theoretical framework and historiography analysis are seen by the author as contributions to the struggles migrants tackle, as they themselves struggle for adequate interpretation of their struggle and against their own fall into oblivion.</p>
<p>Louis Althusser’s philosophy of history and his aleatory materialism approach provide a starting point for the theoretical part of Bojadžijev’s work (272). Althusser’s aleatory materialism regards history as a playground of contingent events and non-teleological process driven by occurrences and processes rather than by persons. Within a theoretical framework propped up by aleatory materialism, the author elaborates upon her relational theory of racism, arguing the thesis of the ‘autonomy of migration’, works out diagnoses on racism and migrant integration and favours the problem-solving option of de-identification (‘<italic>Ent-Identifizierung</italic>’) to the point that these components of theoretical analysis clash with each other. This raises the question of whether the aleatory materialism perspective really suits the theoretical objectives of the study.</p>
<p>While the theoretical construction is riven by contradictions, the historiography of the struggles of migrants in Germany during the 1960s and 1970s succeeds in extrapolating novel questions and subjects of research and also triggers migrant affirmation at the practical level. The historical analysis could have been even more trenchant if the investigated migrant struggles had been examined within the overall context of social movements and struggles in Germany during this period.</p>
<p>Germany’s immigration history, as depicted in Bojadžijev’s book, breaks down stereotypes and expectations of immigrants. Immigrants are discussed not in terms of their willingness to integrate (‘<italic>Integrationswilligkeit</italic>’) and their ability to assimilate, but rather they emerge as autonomous actors ready for battle. Thus, the study accentuates argumentatively an aspect of self-awareness of immigrants which plays a central role in migration processes but is usually ignored in political, research and media discourses on migration. The fact of migration alone – and transcontinental migrations are the best example of this – presupposes courage and morale. This could also explain why security apparatuses of receiving states feel so challenged by migration; those apparatuses play ‘the dark side of the force’ in Bojadžijev’s presentation. Immigrants are more demanding and more ready to struggle for their demands than is generally expected by them in a receiving society.</p>
<p>Seen this way, Bojadžijev’s book puts forward an example of affirmative speech about migrants and migration that is more directed to social practice than theoretical community – an affirmative speech that turns social assumptions and images of migration upside down and which critically questions theoretical approaches and vocabularies in this field. Manuela Bojadžijev’s book propounds a critical theoretical approach in an area of research in which critical theoretical accounts are still underrepresented.</p>
