<p>While interest in the topic of attention has a long history in organizational studies, little research has investigated what <italic>qualities</italic> of attention are most pertinent to working professionals—and how these qualities may be attained. Through the study reported here, I elaborate theory concerning the qualities of attention in a dynamic work setting (trial law). Specifically, I identify the importance of two qualities of attention—attentional breadth and attentional integration—and examine how these qualities connect to the experiences individuals accrue within the focal context. My findings indicate that, through the acquisition of experience, individuals become attentive to a wide range of events surrounding them (via attentional breadth) and attuned to the opportunities that reside within these events (via attentional integration). Therefore, in achieving these two qualities of attention, individuals are able to see not only more events but also more possibilities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Attention is a cornerstone feature of workplace cognition. What workers attend to—and what they miss—shapes their judgments and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612464752">Bazerman &amp; Chugh, 2006</xref>). Scholarly appreciation for the importance of attention in organizations can be traced to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840612464752">Simon’s (1947)</xref> portrayal of attention as a key concept in administrative behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612464752">Ocasio, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612464752">2011</xref>). In more recent years, a number of organizational scholars have taken up the attention torch. As their work suggests, attention influences how individuals react to competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840612464752">Bothner, Kang, &amp; Stuart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840612464752">Kilduff, Elfenbein, &amp; Staw, 2010</xref>), make strategic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840612464752">Marcel, Barr, &amp; Duhaime, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840612464752">Nadkarni &amp; Barr, 2008</xref>) and, more generally, respond to events both within and outside their organizations and industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840612464752">Hoffman &amp; Ocasio, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612464752">Ocasio, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Although this growing “attention to attention” has spawned a number of theoretical perspectives on the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612464752">Ocasio, 2011</xref>), much research on attention pivots around a fundamental observation, namely, that attention is a scarce resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840612464752">Simon, 1978</xref>). Drawing on this observation, researchers have devoted much investigation to how and why individuals direct attention toward certain targets and not others. In psychology, for example, researchers have studied how factors ranging from endogenous (e.g., personal goals) to exogenous (e.g., stimulus salience) can determine where attention is directed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840612464752">Most, Scholl, Clifford, &amp; Simons, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840612464752">Weber &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). Likewise, organizational scholars have investigated matters concerning the direction of attention. Such research indicates that the attention of organizational managers is guided by industry- or field-level events such as deregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840612464752">Cho &amp; Hambrick, 2006</xref>), market evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612464752">Hansen &amp; Haas, 2001</xref>), technological change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840612464752">Kaplan, 2008</xref>), and health care reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840612464752">Nigam &amp; Ocasio, 2010</xref>), as well as more internal factors like organizational architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840612464752">Joseph &amp; Ocasio, 2012</xref>), issue selling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612464752">Dutton &amp; Ashford, 1993</xref>), and voice behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612464752">Bouquet &amp; Birkinshaw, 2008</xref>). Work in this area suggests that in developing certain patterns of attentional focus, individuals and organizations may achieve efficiencies of operation but, in some cases, may open themselves up to unexpected risks or crises stemming from “blind spots” in how attention is allocated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840612464752">Knudsen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0170840612464752">Zajac &amp; Bazerman, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>In short, while the body of literature concerned with attention is prodigious (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612464752">Ocasio, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0170840612464752">Posner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0170840612464752">Posner &amp; Rothbart, 2007</xref>), much research on attention across psychology and organizational studies shares a common concern for the direction of attention. Such research addresses the question: what leads attention to latch on to particular events or phenomena, given the almost infinite set of targets toward which it could be directed? In examining this question, researchers have provided insight into the nature and consequences of cases in which attention lies “here” when, from a performance standpoint, it should be “there.”</p>
<p>While highly informative, research along these lines appears to have produced a theoretical blind spot. In particular, scholarly interest in the direction of attention seems to have constrained investigation of the <italic>qualities</italic> by which attention can be described (regardless of where it is directed). Seeking to patch this blind spot, in recent years organizational scholars have observed that, no matter where it happens to reside, attention may be characterized by various qualities, and have suggested that these qualities carry critical implications in organizational and occupational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840612464752">Barry &amp; Meisiek, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840612464752">Levinthal &amp; Rerup, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840612464752">Rerup, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612464752">Weick &amp; Sutcliffe, 2006</xref>). Scholarly reflections on the qualities of attention concern questions such as: How deeply or richly are stimuli being processed? What meanings are associated with these stimuli? How might these meanings connect to one’s broader objectives? As suggested by these questions, qualities of attention are theoretically noteworthy in that they implicate not simply perception, but interpretation as well. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612464752">Weick and Sutcliffe (2006)</xref> characterize various qualities of attention based on the types of cognitive distinctions they elicit. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840612464752">Rerup (2009)</xref> examines qualities of attention that permit interpretations to be drawn with clarity and richness. In short, research on the qualities of attention emphasizes the interface between perception and interpretation—a conceptual space integral to the study of managerial and organizational cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840612464752">Daft &amp; Weick, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite pioneering work in this area, research on the qualities of attention remains in its infancy. As such, key questions remain unanswered. To begin, because most work on this topic has adopted an organizational level of analysis, little research in management or organizational studies has explored qualities of attention from the viewpoint of individuals. Thus, one might ask: Through what qualities of attention do individuals approach and perform their work? Furthermore, and central to the present manuscript, there has been very little investigation of whether work-related qualities of attention are shaped by a factor often touted as a critical influence on attention in work settings and beyond—namely, the experiences individuals have accrued (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840612464752">Dearborn &amp; Simon, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612464752">Memmert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840612464752">Summerfield, Lepsien, Gitelman, Mesulam, &amp; Nobre, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840612464752">Waller, Huber, &amp; Glick, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840612464752">Werner &amp; Thies, 2000</xref>). That is, while previous research has positioned experience as a key driver of how individuals direct their attention, we know little about whether or how work experience influences the specific qualities that attention may take on in the workplace. Likewise, the mechanisms or pathways by which work experience may connect to these qualities of attention remain largely veiled.</p>
<p>These theoretical gaps merit scholarly investigation. Perhaps most fundamentally, given the importance of attention in the workplace, exploring the qualities of attention from an individual perspective may enhance our understanding of work performance. Along these lines, scholars have argued that when certain qualities of attention are in place, individuals may achieve greater comprehension of events in their work settings, thus enhancing learning and guarding against costly errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612464752">Weick &amp; Sutcliffe, 2006</xref>). Consequently, research is needed to determine what qualities of attention tend to be found in work settings. Of course, beyond simply identifying qualities of attention associated with work, it is worth determining whether and how the experiences individuals accrue in their performance context shape these qualities. As research suggests, those who have attained a considerable amount of experience operating under dynamic, high-stakes conditions within their field or profession tend to be more proficient in their area of practice than those lacking such experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840612464752">Klein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840612464752">Lipshitz, Klein, &amp; Carroll, 2006</xref>). Therefore, unpacking the connections between experience and specific qualities of attention may be pivotal to identifying the qualities of attention that are most essential to performance and the avenues by which these qualities may be attained.</p>
<p>Adopting an individual-centered perspective on the qualities of attention may prove theoretically informative in another respect as well. Recently, organizational scholars have stressed the importance of considering the “microfoundations” of attention and its qualities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840612464752">Gärtner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0170840612464752">Rerup &amp; Feldman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840612464752">Salvato &amp; Rerup, 2011</xref>). In other words, as these scholars suggest, there is a lack of research that explores the psychological mechanisms that may gird the qualities of attention ascribed to organizations. As implied by this appeal, our ability to describe, explain, or make predictions about the qualities of attention associated with organizations should improve by considering how specific qualities of attention manifest themselves at the individual level.</p>
<p>Through the study reported here, I elaborate theory around these very issues. Like many inductive studies, this project began with a broad research question: How do people focus their attention in a dynamic work setting—and how are attention and the work experiences people accrue linked? As data collection proceeded, my study took on greater definition, emerging as an account of the qualities of attention my informants (professional trial lawyers) described and the experience-related pathways that shape these attentional qualities in the dynamic work setting of note (courtroom trials). As used here, the term “dynamic work setting” refers to an occupational context in which people must adapt to changing conditions by making a series of interdependent decisions in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612464752">Edwards, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840612464752">Gonzalez, 2005</xref>). In such contexts, a wide range of potentially meaningful stimuli could be worth attending to at any given moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612464752">Dane, 2011</xref>). Further, how one allocates attention in these contexts may carry critical consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840612464752">Weick &amp; Roberts, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840612464752">Weick, Sutcliffe, &amp; Obstfeld, 1999</xref>). As a result, attention is considered a pivotal aspect of performance in dynamic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612464752">Endsley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612464752">Hinsz, Wallace, &amp; Ladbury, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, my findings indicate that in accruing certain types of experience individuals attain two key qualities of attention. Specifically, they develop the capacity to attend to a wide range of events (attentional breadth) and learn how to opportunistically incorporate these events into the overall message they seek to convey (attentional integration). More generally, my findings inform, extend, and, in some respects, provide grounds to reinterpret existing scholarship concerning the qualities of attention. Below, I offer a closer look at research surrounding qualities of attention before turning to the details of my study.</p>

<title>Qualities of Attention</title>
<p>As noted, a limited line of organizational scholarship has begun to examine the qualities that attention may take on. At a broad level, this emerging line of inquiry connects to research related to topics such as mindfulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840612464752">Barry &amp; Meisiek, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612464752">Dane, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840612464752">Rerup, 2005</xref>), mindful organizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840612464752">Vogus, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840612464752">Weick et al., 1999</xref>), and mindful versus less-mindful learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840612464752">Levinthal &amp; Rerup, 2006</xref>). What these topics have in common is the notion that attention is often inadequately or improperly applied to targets associated with individual or organizational performance. For example, although individuals may direct their attention toward task-related stimuli, they may apply it in largely habitual or mindless ways and give little thought to the meanings or nuances associated with the phenomena being observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840612464752">Fiol &amp; O’Connor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840612464752">Rafaeli, Sagy, &amp; Derfler-Rozin, 2008</xref>). Extending this observation to high reliability organizations (HROs)—organizations that demonstrate the ability to operate nearly error-free in in complex, dynamic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840612464752">Vogus, 2011</xref>)—Weick and colleagues argued that the ability of HROs to avoid potentially catastrophic errors may be attributed to their competence at focusing attention in a manner that produces “rich awareness of discriminatory detail” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840612464752">Weick, 1999</xref>, p. 88). More generally, research focusing on HROs assigns a central role to the interpretive aspects of attention and suggests that, for such organizations, success is predicated on maintaining sufficiently rich and nuanced attentiveness to unfolding events (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840612464752">Roberts &amp; Bea, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840612464752">Roth, Multer, &amp; Raslear, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840612464752">Vogus &amp; Welbourne, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Bringing together research along these lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612464752">Weick and Sutcliffe (2006)</xref> developed theory around what they termed <italic>the quality of organizational attention</italic>. As Weick and Sutcliffe argue, “attention is more plentiful and sufficient when it becomes more stable and vivid” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612464752">2006</xref>, p. 521). Unpacking this claim, these scholars maintain that two qualities in particular—stability and vividness—can be used to describe organizational patterns of attention. The former quality, stability, concerns the degree to which one focuses attention intently on a particular object. High stability implies deep and sustained attention and the absence of disruption, wandering, or, in Weick and Sutcliffe’s words, “wobbling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612464752">2006</xref>, p. 518). The latter quality, vividness, concerns the degree to which attention fosters a rich interpretation of the focal object. Vividness is high when the representations arising from attention are complex, discerning, and relatively unencumbered by existing conceptual schemes or labels. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612464752">Weick and Sutcliffe (2006)</xref> suggest, it is possible to focus attention in a manner that is simultaneously highly stable and highly vivid; in fact, they stress the importance of cultivating each quality.</p>
<p>Taking stock of these qualities of attention, Rerup found through a case study of unexpected crises and organizational learning that organizations learn from crises through “attentional triangulation,” which consists of the interplay between stability, vividness, and a third quality more uniquely associated with an organizational level of analysis, coherence— “how similar or compatible attention to issues is across levels, units, and people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840612464752">Rerup, 2009</xref>, p. 878). Through his work, Rerup defines both stability and vividness in a manner similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612464752">Weick and Sutcliffe (2006)</xref>. In particular, he ties stability to “sustained attention to issues” and vividness to “the complexity of representation of issues” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840612464752">Rerup, 2009</xref>, p. 878).</p>
<p>In a review of research on attention in organizational scholarship, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612464752">Ocasio (2011)</xref> classifies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840612464752">Rerup’s (2009)</xref> work as concerned with the “engagement” of attention—or the processes by which cognitive resources are directed and employed to aid problem solving, decision making, and sensemaking. In noting that such research relates to the quality of organizational attention, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612464752">Ocasio (2011)</xref> contributes to work in this area by adopting a neurocognitive perspective on the topic. In doing so, he links the concept of stability to “vigilance” and maintains that this quality of attention involves sustained concentration on a given object of attention. At the same time, he suggests that engaging attention effectively depends on the ability to detach attention from a given stimulus, reallocate it as needed, and ultimately return it to its original target at the appropriate point. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612464752">Ocasio (2011)</xref> posits a key role for “executive attention” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840612464752">Rueda, Posner, &amp; Rothbart, 2005</xref>) in terms of the qualities attention may take on as it is allocated.</p>
<p>As hinted by the brevity of this review, research on the qualities of attention, though fundamentally insightful, remains limited. Consequently, key questions remain. In particular, because most research focusing on qualities of attention has adopted an organizational level of analysis, little research in management and organizational studies has explored qualities of attention from the perspective of individuals. As such, we know little about what specific qualities of attention are pertinent to individuals as they operate in dynamic work settings and even less about how the experiences individuals accrue shape these qualities. Elaborating theory in this regard is important for reasons discussed earlier. Namely, such work promises to identify qualities of attention conducive to work performance, spotlight the experience-based pathways and mechanisms by which these qualities may be attained, and inform scholarly understanding of the microfoundations of attentional qualities ascribed to organizations. The study reported below offers theoretical contributions in each of these respects.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>I embarked on this study with the aim of elaborating theory on how people focus their attention in dynamic work settings and exploring the role of experience toward this end. Because theory in this area is underdeveloped, I adopted an inductive research approach. Inductive methods are conducive to elaborating theory concerning preexisting concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612464752">Lee, Mitchell, &amp; Sablynski, 1999</xref>), particularly when the mechanisms accounting for the phenomena of interest are relatively unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840612464752">Marshall &amp; Rossman, 1989</xref>). In following this inductive approach and comparing my emerging findings with extant research on attention, the relevance of this project to the <italic>qualities</italic> of attention—and the influences of experience upon these qualities—gradually became apparent.</p>
<sec id="section4-0170840612464752">
<title>Research context</title>
<p>A key criterion for selecting a research context is determining whether a rich mix of the concepts and processes inherent to the research question can be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840612464752">Marshall &amp; Rossman, 1989</xref>). Given this criterion, I determined that the profession of trial law (or <italic>litigation</italic>) was well suited to studying my concepts of interest for two reasons. First, I elected to study trial law because courtroom trials are inherently dynamic. As noted earlier, dynamic settings require people to respond to changing conditions by making a series of interdependent decisions in real time. Such situations are often found where people must collaborate, communicate, or compete in an interdependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612464752">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840612464752">Gonzalez, 2005</xref>). Due to these features, dynamic workplace settings tend to amplify the performance consequences of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612464752">Hinsz et al., 2009</xref>). Trial lawyers operate in a dynamic context given that, during trials, they must frequently and rapidly respond to a range of unanticipated events. For example, in most trials, witnesses make unexpected statements, judges offer surprising rulings, and lawyers engage in maneuvers designed to disrupt and undermine the arguments of their opposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612464752">Levine, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840612464752">McElhaney, 1995</xref>). In response to such events, trial lawyers make a number of interdependent decisions in real time—hallmarks of a dynamic setting.</p>
<p>Second, I selected trial law as the context for this study because, within this profession, job experience can be systematically assessed and compared. As Benner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840612464752">2001</xref>, p. 36) notes, job experience represents something more than “the mere passage of time”—it pertains to the changes that develop through “encounters with many actual practical situations.” In line with this perspective, lawyers accrue experience as they undergo a relatively standardized sequence of training that enables them to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to perform their work. Typically this process involves matriculating in and graduating from law school, passing the state bar examination, securing a job, and performing at a sufficiently high level to maintain one’s employment. Yet, despite their shared experiences, litigators differ not only in their professional tenure but also with regard to a critical—and reportable—experience-related factor: the number of cases they have tried. For this reason, it is possible to draw distinctions between trial lawyers with high versus low levels of experience.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>My approach to collecting data involved a two-stage process. In the first stage, I observed courtroom trials; in the second stage, I conducted research interviews with trial lawyers. I detail each of these stages below.</p>
<sec id="section6-0170840612464752">
<title>Observations</title>
<p>To achieve a first-hand view of how lawyers operate under the dynamic conditions of courtroom trials, I began this project by collecting data through an observational approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0170840612464752">Whyte, 1984</xref>). Specifically, in a large American city, I observed three felony trials in their entirety—a murder case (three days), a burglary case (two days), and an illegal possession of a handgun case (one day). During each of these trials, I recorded my observations (amounting to approximately 25 pages of handwritten notes). Moreover, the presiding judge of the burglary trial was aware of the nature of my project and met with me immediately upon the conclusion of the trial to discuss his perspective on the events that had occurred. This judge also allowed me to attend his debriefing of the jury members at the conclusion of the trial. I took notes based on my conversations with the judge as well as the dialog I observed between the judge and the members of the jury. Through these observations, I developed a better understanding of the types of events that contribute to the dynamic nature of the courtroom. The insights I gained also informed the conversations I had with lawyers during my research interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0170840612464752">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>To elaborate theory surrounding the concepts central to my study, I gathered data through semi-structured interviews with 46 trial lawyers (one interview per lawyer) across three American cities. Interviews were between 45 and 80 minutes and were recorded and transcribed in their entirety (yielding 783 pages of data). Although each interview was facilitated by a protocol of questions related to my theoretical interests, at times I deviated from the content and sequence of this protocol to explore theoretically relevant points raised by my informants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0170840612464752">Spradley, 1979</xref>). Consistent with the view that inductive research involves an iterative process in which data collection and interpretation occur concurrently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840612464752">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840612464752">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>), I altered my protocol to pursue emerging themes as the interview phase of the assignment progressed. The final version of the interview protocol is included in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0170840612464752">Appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>In selecting informants for this study, I employed a purposeful sampling method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840612464752">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>) designed to select lawyers who varied in the number of cases they had tried. I recruited these lawyers through the assistance of personal contacts in the field of law as well as through the support of a professional association for trial lawyers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840612464752">Table 1</xref> summarizes the trial law experience (number of trials and professional tenure) of the lawyers I interviewed and notes their primary areas of practice. As is common, many of the lawyers in my sample, particularly those with high professional tenure, had held a variety of positions over the course of their careers. For example, several of the private practice criminal defense lawyers I interviewed had previously served as a state’s attorney, public defender, or both. It also bears noting that, of the lawyers I interviewed, seven were females (informant codes: 01, 02, 07, 08, 12, 14, and 23).</p>

<p>I concluded the interview phase of this project when it became evident I had reached theoretical saturation—the point at which “no new properties and dimensions emerged from the data, and the analysis had accounted for much of the possible variability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840612464752">Strauss &amp; Corbin 1998</xref>, p. 158). Theoretical saturation was evident when I observed that the data categories derived through my final interviews were redundant with and easily captured by the set of categories (described below) I had already developed.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section8-0170840612464752">
<title>Data analysis and validity</title>
<p>I analyzed my data using a grounded theory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840612464752">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840612464752">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). More specifically, I gathered my data in an alternating, iterative manner, such that I coded and analyzed the initial data I collected while collecting additional data in response to emergent themes and categories. Throughout this process I compared the data I collected to the literature on attention, focusing in particular on organizational research on this topic. In comparing themes and codes associated with my data to related bodies of work, I recognized the relevance of these data to scholarship concerned with the qualities of attention.</p>
<p>In analyzing my data, I began by following procedures designed to help organize the “first-order” data. In reading my observation notes and interview transcripts, I identified units of information that captured distinct ideas of relevance to my theoretical interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612464752">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840612464752">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Each of these data units captured a single idea or topic. I then organized these units into categories based on the underlying idea, topic, or feature they represented.</p>
<p>Next, I named the categories that emerged through the process noted above. Thus, I developed a comprehensive scheme of theoretical categories designed to capture the topics, themes, and concepts that emerged through my data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840612464752">Locke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840612464752">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840612464752">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). As I labeled these categories, I continued to re-examine the data to determine whether the data units were consistent with emerging categories and whether additional categories were necessary. Following this iterative process, I modified some categories to ensure that I captured all relevant data units in an accurate categorical scheme.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during this stage of my data analysis, I systematically compared the responses of informants across various levels of trial law experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840612464752">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). In doing so, I found key differences in the responses of lawyers who had tried fewer than 20 cases and those who had tried a greater number of cases, several of whom estimated their number of cases tried in the “hundreds” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840612464752">Table 1</xref> reflects these experience categories). Through my data analysis, I found that in discussing what it is like to focus attention during courtroom trials, lawyers who had tried relatively few cases emphasized the difficulties associated with focusing their attention effectively. In contrast, lawyers with more trial experience, though just as appreciative of the challenges associated with focusing attention effectively, tended to discuss how they managed these challenges adroitly. Consequently, I continued to compare the responses of those with high versus low trial law experience to understand this phenomenon better. In doing so, I identified specific qualities of attention (i.e., attentional breadth and attentional integration) associated with high levels of experience, along with mechanisms indicating how acquiring trial law experience gives rise to these qualities. For example, in comparing the responses of lawyers across different levels of experience within the data category “stress level,” I found that lawyers who had tried many cases reported lower levels of trial-related stress than those who had tried fewer—and, further, I found that stress compromises attentional breadth within the courtroom.</p>
<p>Finally, in examining these data categories, I searched for and identified aggregate dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840612464752">Corley &amp; Gioia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840612464752">Pratt, Rockmann, &amp; Kaufmann, 2006</xref>) into which these categories could be organized to achieve a coherent data structure. For example, both “stress level” and another category, “rule following,” were mechanisms accounting for the connection I found between experience and attentional breadth. Hence, I included these two categories in the aggregate dimension, “experience and attentional breadth: explanatory mechanisms.” <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0170840612464752">Table 2</xref> depicts my data structure (first-order data, theoretical categories, and aggregate dimensions).</p>

<p>In following the multi-phase coding process outlined above, my intention was to strengthen the rigor of my data analysis and the validity of my findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840612464752">Lee, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0170840612464752">Yin, 1994</xref>). Facilitating this pursuit, as noted above, I made a number of systematic comparisons as I analyzed my data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840612464752">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). That is, I compared the responses of lawyers with relatively more versus less trial law experience to examine the differences in the qualities of attention discussed by lawyers across varying experience levels. These comparisons permitted me to identify not simply the qualities of attention associated with trial law experience, but also the mechanisms accounting for the emergence of these qualities. I also made a concerted effort to collect data using two different research techniques or “strategies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840612464752">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>)—nonparticipant observation and interviews. While I conducted my observations primarily with the intent of achieving a broad understanding of the research context and informing my interview protocol, the high degree of overlap I noted between the events observed in the courtroom and my informants’ descriptions of courtroom trials provided assurance that my findings were not simply an artifact of using one data collection technique. Finally, to validate my findings further, I employed two “member checks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612464752">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). Specifically, I met with and discussed my findings with one of my informants as well as a trial lawyer I had not interviewed for this study. Each of these litigators indicated that my findings generally accorded with their views on the topic and provided input that helped clarify and enhance my interpretation of the data.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section9-0170840612464752">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Through the data collection and analysis procedures described above, I explored how trial lawyers focus their attention in the courtroom and what role experience plays in this regard. During this process, the importance of certain qualities of attention—and the connections between experience and these qualities—emerged as critical elements of my findings. To foreshadow the findings that follow, my data point to two distinct attention-related challenges associated with trial law: the first concerning the degree to which lawyers are able to notice events unfolding around them; the second concerning what lawyers are able to glean or extract from noticed events. My data suggest that in accruing trial law experience, lawyers become increasingly adept at handling these challenges as they develop specific qualities of attention referred to as attentional breadth and attentional integration. Attentional breadth permits individuals to take note of a large number of events in their performance environment and attentional integration permits them to leverage these events as effectively as possible. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0170840612464752">Figure 1</xref> depicts these qualities of attention and their connections to experience—connections discussed at length below.</p>

<title>Noticing courtroom events: the role of attentional breadth</title>
<p>With respect to where they should focus their attention during trials, there was considerable agreement among the trial lawyers I interviewed. As my data reveal, lawyers seek to focus attention on a wide variety of events in the courtroom. In particular, they strive to listen to witnesses and opposing lawyers while also observing any number of other events that may unfold around them. With regard to “listening,” my informants reported attempting to focus on what witnesses say as they testify, in part because witnesses often make unexpected statements. Unexpected statements are particularly common when lawyers cross examine witnesses. As an informant mentioned, “With cross examination you don’t know exactly what the person’s going to say, so you have to listen carefully” (40). In addition to listening to witnesses, it is also important for lawyers to listen to the questions posed by opposing attorneys because these questions may be improper and thus worth objecting to. Objections must be timely, however. As an informant stated, “For the most part you have to object in the time it takes [the other lawyer] to basically put a period or a question mark at the end of their sentence and the time that the witness [starts to] answer the question; that might be a tenth of a second” (09). Therefore, to make objections, a lawyer must listen carefully to the other attorney.</p>
<p>As crucial as it is to listen carefully in the courtroom, my informants also reported that the focus of their attention should not be limited to listening alone. For example, lawyers find it useful to watch the reactions of the jury members to courtroom events. Doing so enables lawyers to determine whether the jury members are attuned to the trial. As an informant remarked, “If all I’m paying attention to is the witness, then I don’t know if the jury is paying attention to what I’m doing” (10). Further, lawyers attempt to focus attention on witnesses—not only what they are saying (as noted above), but also their body language. According to one informant, “We have witnesses all the time that, if they get a document and they don’t like it, they refuse to touch it” (07). Moreover, my informants reported that a number of other events, such as the behavior of the opposing lawyer and the judge, are also worth attending to.</p>
<p>As these statements reveal, in attending to the courtroom environment, trial lawyers aim to focus their attention <italic>widely</italic>. That is, they strive to allocate attention throughout the courtroom, scanning for events (e.g., statements, actions) that may affect how members of the jury view the case and, ultimately, reach a verdict. Lawyers make decisions and adjust their tactics based on what they hear and see; it is therefore critical that they notice as many potentially critical events as possible during trials.</p>
<p>At a more conceptual level, these points suggest that lawyers pursue (and benefit from) a particular quality of attention, one that might be described best as <italic>attentional breadth</italic>. In research focusing on perception, attentional breadth concerns the range of stimuli one attends to within a given scene or situation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612464752">Beyer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840612464752">Pringle, Irwin, Kramer, &amp; Atchley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840612464752">Rowe, Hirsh, &amp; Anderson, 2007</xref>). By extension, in a dynamic work setting, such as trial law, attentional breadth constitutes the range of events in one’s environment that one notices. The higher a trial lawyer’s breadth of attention, the more events this lawyer attends to—and the more inputs he or she has available for making decisions and tactical adjustments. When attentional breadth is high, lawyers are almost continually scanning the courtroom, switching from one stimulus to another to capture a wide range of events. For example, a lawyer might be listening intently to a witness while almost simultaneously taking note of the reactions of the jury members to the witness’s testimony. As one informant noted, “You almost wish you could keep one eye on the witness and one eye on the jury, and you do to some extent; you switch back and forth” (43).</p>
<p>Given that attention is a scarce resource, it is not possible for lawyers to notice all potentially meaningful events during the course of a trial. In this sense, attentional breadth has its limits. Nevertheless, my data indicate that trial lawyers may vary considerably in their level of attentional breadth. Indeed, for reasons detailed shortly, some lawyers may find it very difficult to focus on more than a highly limited selection of courtroom events. This point is important. It suggests that while trial lawyers may agree on the desirability of attentional breadth, only some wield this quality of attention. As discussed below, achieving and maintaining wide attentional breadth, though challenging, becomes increasingly possible through the acquisition of trial law experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0170840612464752">
<title>Developing attentional breadth through trial law experience</title>
<p>Attending to a wide range of events during a trial is not easy, even for the most seasoned trial lawyer. Informants across all levels of experience discussed the challenges associated with doing so. The following comments from a veteran trial attorney speak to these challenges.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Look at a trial lawyer. He’s sitting in there. He’s got to listen to the witness. He’s got to listen to the questions. He’s got to sit there and try to keep an eye on the jury to figure out what they’re really interested in. He’s got to keep some kind of eye on his client and make sure they aren’t making faces or doing something stupid that will irritate the jury, or the jury would say, “Did you see that? When he was sitting there on that question, he jerked.” That hurts us. And you have to listen to that question and before the witness starts answering, you’re focusing on what the judge is thinking, what the jury’s thinking, what your client’s thinking. They expect an answer. You’ve got to think in your head, “I’ve got to object to this question right now, and I’ve got to spell out the grounds for it.” And I’m telling you, it’s split second, and, you know, if you miss it and the question comes out and the answer’s out there, you could be screwed. It could cost you the case. (44)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While this description of the attention-related challenges of trial law might resonate with many in the profession, in analyzing my data I identified differences in how litigators with varying levels of trial law experience talked about how they focus their attention during trials. In particular, highly experienced lawyers provided descriptive accounts of what they attend to and indicated that they possess some level of competence at focusing attention widely. The following account illustrates just how attentive experienced lawyers can be to a wide range of courtroom events.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The number one thing you focus on is the witness who’s testifying at the time, and the number two thing you focus on is what the lawyer asking the questions of that witness is asking and what he’s showing the witness. Kind of those two things. Then the number three thing you focus on is the jury’s reaction to those things. Their body language. Are they asleep? Are they laughing? Do they appear leaning forward in their seats, engrossed in what’s happening? Now, when I’m doing the direct examination, I’m asking the questions. I’m focusing on: can the jury see what I’m showing the witness? Am I asking clear questions, questions as clear as I can make them? Is the witness giving me the information I need? Am I telling the story I need to tell, and is the jury paying attention to [me]? (29)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, lawyers who had tried relatively fewer cases tended to discuss their attention-related shortcomings and emphasized how difficult it is to focus their attention widely. The following quote reveals the challenges and, indeed, the frustrations associated with focusing attention in the courtroom from the perspective of a lawyer who had tried only five cases.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Yeah, it’s rough. It’s kind of like driving through the worst traffic in Chicago with children yelling at you from the back seat because…you want to pay attention to what the jury’s reaction is, you want to pay attention to what the judge’s reaction is, you want to be listening to the witness, but while the witness is speaking you want to be writing down what the witness is saying for your records and for future reference, you’re trying to think of what the next question is going to be even though you are trying to listen to the current question. And then, your flow could be disrupted by the opposing attorney making an objection of some kind. (04)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Beyond highlighting a general connection between trial law experience and attentional breadth, my data point to specific mechanisms that may account for the link between them. As discussed below, reduced stress levels and automatic rule following may govern the connection between experience and attentional breadth. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840612464752">Table 3</xref> presents representative data supporting each of these mechanisms.</p>

<td>Fear, I think, can kind of shut down any kind of ability to—whatever it is—to kind of just be in the moment and pay attention to what’s going on. I think, especially, if you’re afraid, if it’s this—you’re afraid based on, “How do I look? Am I gonna be in trouble for this?”…It becomes this kind of, like, self-centered thing. I think all that kind of stuff shuts you down from what’s going on around you. (11)<break/>And it is all about feeling comfortable in the environment and being able to [remain calm]. The stress is gone so you can direct it and focus it in the direction it needs to be. I still have a long way to go, long way. But I feel like I’m a completely different attorney from when I first started and that’s just in two years. (12)<break/>You’re just sitting there stammering in front of a judge for three minutes while the jury’s watching you basically wet your pants. I mean, like, it’s brutal, and you know it’s brutal so that makes it worse because now you’re freaking yourself out about how bad it looks. And you know I mean it’s just this continuing spiral, and you’ll just—it’ll go worse, and worse, and worse, and worse. You’re focused on your own mistake and you’re trying to think about “Okay, what can I do to fix that? I’m gonna write out this little outline of all these great things I’m gonna say when I get a chance to stand up again.” But you’re not listening to the…next witness. (09)</td>
<td>Your attention is divided in so many different directions. Sometimes when [I am] listening to the defense attorney ask the questions, I [find] myself planning my cross examination while I’m listening to the direct examination of the defense. So there have been times where I’ve missed something objectionable because you know, I’m not there. I’m still too new. I’m still too focused on what questions I’m going to ask and when it’s going to be my turn because [I am] listening to what he’s saying but I’m not, I’m really focusing on his answers and not so much the questions, if that makes sense. And you have to object to the question because if you don’t, they get to answer if you haven’t objected. That for me is the hardest part. (12)<break/>By the time you get to trial, you know all your evidence, you know your witnesses, you know your legal arguments. So it’s more to make sure everything goes smoothly that you’re concerned about, and are you going to know when to say “Objection” and what you’re going to say after when the judge says, “What are your grounds?” Those kind of things I think you’re more concerned about.

<title>Reduced stress</title>
<p>The majority of my informants reported that they experience stress or anxiety quite often in the courtroom. Although my informants mentioned that some level of stress is not necessarily problematic, my data indicate that, during trials, neophyte lawyers tend to experience very high levels of stress. As one lawyer remarked, “The first trial that I had, I had trouble just functioning physically and remembering to talk” (08). At such high levels of stress, it is difficult for lawyers to distribute their attention widely across courtroom events. As several informants discussed, stress can tear attention away from courtroom events, toward ancillary concerns. As informant 11 mentioned, stress rooted in “fear” draws attention inward to thoughts like, “How do I look? Am I gonna be in trouble for this?” which prevents lawyers from attending to events occurring around them (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840612464752">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Most informants reported that as they gained trial law experience, their level of stress in the courtroom decreased to some degree. As one commented:<disp-quote>
<p>You’re just used to talking in front of a jury, or a judge, so it’s just not a big deal anymore…and you know certain prosecutors, you are familiar with how they’re going to…take or approach a case. So, I mean all of that contributes to just being in general more comfortable with your case and the surrounding setting in a courtroom. (21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>My data further suggest that the decrease in stress associated with experience enhances attentional breadth. For example, as noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840612464752">Table 3</xref>, an attorney who reported that during her initial trials she “didn’t even look at the jury” eventually reached a point at which she “feels comfortable” and therefore “can really hone in on what the jurors are doing” (23). Likewise, informant 40 described how the reduction of anxiety that occurs through experience reduces how “distracted” lawyers are by issues or concerns separate from ongoing events—a threat to attentional breadth. Thus, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0170840612464752">Figure 1</xref>, reduced stress is a core mechanism accounting for the link between experience and attentional breadth in trial law.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0170840612464752">
<title>Automatic rule following</title>
<p>In trying cases, lawyers must adhere to the “rules of evidence and procedure”—rules that govern the process by which cases are tried. These rules cover topics such as how one should interact with witnesses, solicit testimony, present physical evidence, and make objections. Neophyte trial lawyers reported devoting considerable attention to following these rules—for example, by assessing whether the questions opposing attorneys ask witnesses are rule-consistent. As a highly experienced lawyer mentioned, “Young lawyers tend to [think about] what the technical problem with this question is. Is it asking for hearsay? Is it leading? Is it somehow improper? And they work through the process, a checklist” (42). As indicated by the quotes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840612464752">Table 3</xref>, when novice litigators focus intently on the rules of evidence and procedure, they may fail to attend to what witnesses are saying and what is going on around them in the courtroom because of their preoccupation with following these rules (e.g., wondering when to say “Objection”—informant 07). Echoing this observation, informant 14 stated, “I think that during the original trials [in one’s career], you’re so obsessed with what you’re doing—are you going to do it right?—that you don’t notice all the other things going on.”</p>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840612464752">Table 3</xref>, lawyers who have tried more cases report possessing the ability to follow rules of evidence and procedure in a less effortful or even an automatic manner. For example, as suggested by informant 26, experienced lawyers develop an ear for whether a particular statement constitutes hearsay based on whether it “sounds right.” The development of rule-following automaticity likely does not begin until lawyers have tried several cases. As an informant mentioned:<disp-quote>
<p>When I first started, [I had] to think about everything because you don’t know what’s going to come up… and I would bring down my “Evidence with Objections” [manual]. I needed…crutches because procedurally this could happen, this could happen, this could happen and legally this could happen. So I [had] my crutches with me. But now, I’ve been through enough where I don’t need those crutches…I have a good enough command of the law and that comes with practice. (12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As lawyers accrue considerable trial experience, their ability to adhere to the rules of evidence and procedure appears to become largely automatic. After trying many cases, lawyers view themselves as having transitioned from a phase described by informant 12 as one in which “I’m still too focused on what questions I’m going to ask and when it’s going to be my turn” to a point at which, in the words of informant 40, “you develop a muscle memory” (40). As used by this informant, the term “muscle memory” refers to an automated adherence to the rules of evidence and procedure.</p>
<p>Once lawyers are able to follow the rules of evidence and procedure automatically, they no longer must expend significant attention thinking about those rules. As even some of the less experienced lawyers acknowledged (crediting their experienced counterparts), trying a number of cases permits lawyers to develop the “freedom to say what you’re saying, but be thinking about something different” (informant 09) and grants lawyers the ability to focus “on the substance, not on the form” of trial events (informant 10). Drawing on the terms used by informant 10, in achieving automatic adherence to the “form” of a case, or the legally mandated framework that the arguments and evidence of the case must fit into, lawyers become, in their own judgment, more capable of focusing on the “substance” of a case, as contained in the stream of events occurring in the courtroom. In short, as rule following becomes increasingly automatic, lawyers achieve a higher level of attentional breadth.</p>

<sec id="section14-0170840612464752">
<title>Interpreting courtroom events: the role of attentional integration</title>
<p>As suggested thus far, one fundamental challenge lawyers encounter in the courtroom is focusing their attention widely enough to notice the events that provide for informed decision making and timely adjustments. As it turns out, however, this is not their only attention-related challenge. My findings point to a second and more subtle, but no less consequential, challenge. Specifically, to engage with the events they notice, lawyers must understand the connections between the events and the case they are seeking to advance. In other words, lawyers must not only notice courtroom events, they must also interpret these events productively. Doing so involves recognizing how to incorporate ongoing events into the broader message they aim to communicate. I refer to this quality of attention as <italic>attentional integration</italic>.</p>
<p>While, at least at the surface, some events may seem a poor fit with one’s overarching message, attentional integration permits one to fold these events into the message—perhaps even in a way that enhances it. Attentional integration is therefore opportunistic; it enables individuals to capitalize upon or exploit emergent events. As such, attentional integration is an important quality of attention in dynamic settings—especially those concerned with storytelling, persuasion, or social influence.</p>
<p>Attentional integration revealed itself in my data through examples informants provided of situations in which some lawyers spot opportunities where others do not. For example, informant 29 discussed exploiting a seemingly problematic development (an attempt by the opposing lawyer to gain an unfair advantage).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The judge has said before the trial, “You’re not going into Area X.” And [the other party’s lawyer] goes into Area X intentionally…But because you know they’re about to stumble into the forbidden zone, and you want to go to the forbidden zone, you don’t object, and [you] let them stumble into it, so that the judge would then let you get into some form of [otherwise] inadmissible testimony. For example, the classic case in a criminal trial is they call a character witness, and the character witness says, “Oh, little Joey. He’s a great young man. He’s never been in trouble in his life.” That opens up the door to criminal arrests and convictions that otherwise would be inadmissible. You’re not supposed to be able to put on that kind of character testimony, so I could object and limit what [the witness] is saying about little Joey. But [I] might let them have more rope, thinking they’ll open the door. “Judge, they told the jury that Joey’s never been in trouble. That’s a false statement. I’m now allowed to correct that.” They could have not called that witness, and not created that false impression, but since they opened the door…</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As suggested by this example, a lawyer may recognize that along with an underhanded tactic by the opposition comes an opportunity to bolster the content of one’s own case. By spotting this opportunity in the moment and seizing it—in this case, by <italic>not</italic> objecting—one gains an advantage.</p>
<p>Attentional integration may unfold in other ways as well. For example, a lawyer might interpret a seemingly harmful statement by a witness as a serendipitous moment in the trial. To illustrate:<disp-quote>
<p>[What] happens quite a bit [is]…you’re working on the case and…the defendant is saying that this incident never happened. Like your [client] just completely made this up, right? Well, from one lawyer’s perspective they might say, “Oh, that’s really bad because I’ve got to prove to the jury that this accident [occurred]”…But on the other hand though what’s really powerful is a different lawyer might stand up and go, “You know what? That just shows they keep bad records, just like they run a bad company. And the reason why they say it never happened is because they don’t have training on how to deal with these kinds of accidents.” And the same occurrence could, for one lawyer, be their death knell and, for another lawyer, be like the best thing that’s ever happened in that case. (09)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another lawyer I interviewed demonstrated just how far one might go with attentional integration. When I brought up what I believed to be a categorically negative event from the standpoint of the prosecuting attorney in the infamous O.J. Simpson trial—a situation in which Simpson could not successfully put on a pair of gloves that he supposedly wore at the time of the murders he was charged with committing—my informant revealed how even this seemingly disastrous event could be interpreted in line with the prosecution’s case.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Had I been [the prosecuting attorney]…I would say: “The glove <italic>does</italic> fit properly and to show you Mr. Simpson’s way of taking evidence and trying to change it, Mr. Simpson won’t even put these gloves on for you. He won’t even put them on properly for you, ladies and gentlemen. There’s only one way to put on a pair of gloves…you put them on and you put them over your hand. Mr. Simpson knows how to do this. Mr. Simpson played football in Buffalo [New York]. He knows how to put on a pair of gloves and he didn’t put them on properly. It’s not that the gloves don’t fit, it’s that Mr. Simpson isn’t making them fit, just like Mr. Simpson and his lawyer [aren’t] making everything else fit in this case. But it’s clear that it all fits. It’s clear that the knife certainly fit in his hand, the blade certainly fit into her chest, the blade certainly fit into his back”… Basically [I would have] made the jury think that…Simpson is even more slimy. (33)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Underlying these examples are common elements. Namely, each concerns unexpected events that a lawyer both noticed and interpreted productively in a manner consistent with and supportive of the case being put forward. Such examples encapsulate attentional integration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0170840612464752">
<title>Developing attentional integration through trial law experience</title>
<p>My data indicate that attentional integration tends to be higher among experienced trial lawyers. On this point, informant 29 mentioned that earlier in his career he viewed the typical juror as an “ordinary, reasonable, prudent person” who would respond to whatever meaning an event carried in and of itself. In acquiring trial law experience he came to recognize that, particularly for jurors favorably inclined toward his case, he could use virtually any event to support that case. Consequently, he found himself interpreting events in ways that would provide jurors with “ammunition” as they deliberated the case at the end of the trial.</p>
<p>Along related lines, informant 09 discussed how, through the right type of interpretation, events that might seem problematic, such as people losing their temper, could be integrated to support one’s case to a degree that, he suggested, is “wildly effective.” However, informant 09 did not imply that he possessed great skill in this respect. On the contrary, he suggested that demonstrations of what I am calling attentional integration are found primarily among highly experienced trial lawyers. Similarly, a relatively inexperienced trial lawyer discussed the challenges he faces in “modifying his angle” in response to unfolding events.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s one thing for me to kind of direct the trial as I want it to go or control how the other side’s information is presented; it’s another to try and get a sense of what’s going on in the courtroom—how the jury or the judge has received whatever information just came out—and then modifying what…my angle is, based on that. (05)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The reflections offered above by informants 05 and 09 are actually quite insightful, given these informants’ relatively low levels of experience. Most inexperienced lawyers in my sample said relatively little pertinent to the concept of attentional integration. This suggests that novice lawyers not only find it difficult to focus attention in an integrative manner but also are less appreciative than veteran attorneys of the importance of doing so.</p>
<p>Besides suggesting that attentional integration is more common among highly experienced trial lawyers than novice lawyers, my data point to specific mechanisms linking experience to attentional integration. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464752">Table 4</xref> provides representative data in this regard. As depicted in the table and discussed below, two mechanisms—appreciating the ambiguity of courtroom events and building a response repertoire for engaging with courtroom events—may account for the connection between experience and attentional integration.</p>

<title>Appreciating event ambiguity</title>
<p>In a fundamental sense, the members of the jury determine a lawyer’s success in the courtroom. How jurors view events in the courtroom is therefore critical; it shapes their perceptions of the case, their deliberations, and ultimately, their verdict. Of course, juries generally are not composed of legal experts but rather of “ordinary citizens” whose interpretations of events transpiring in the courtroom may be shaped by any number of factors. According to my data, neophyte trial lawyers are less appreciative of this point than their highly experienced counterparts. As it turns out, novice lawyers are likely to make unfounded or overly hasty assumptions about whether events are “good” or “bad” in terms of their effect on the jury. In line with this perspective, informant 11 discussed how he tends to view a number of events as “bad things,” and how he typically reacts to such events with thoughts like, “Oh shit, I wish that didn’t get said just now” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464752">Table 4</xref>). These rather polarizing views of courtroom events can lead to confusion when it turns out that jury members have not interpreted the event as the lawyer expected they would. For example, an inexperienced lawyer noted his bewilderment when members of the jury did not resonate with a line of argument he thought was “clear as a bell” and thus good for the case he was presenting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464752">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, experienced lawyers understand better that jurors may interpret courtroom events in any number of ways—which are sometimes difficult to predict. That is, while an unexpected event—a witness lying under oath, for example—might seem at first blush either damaging or helpful to one’s case, the net impact of this event is actually somewhat uncertain. As informant 46 mentioned, “You’re not sure how the jury takes it” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464752">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Coinciding with this insight, experienced lawyers also tend to understand that juror interpretations of unfolding events are connected to how lawyers themselves engage with or respond to the event that has occurred. Consequently, experienced lawyers recognize that although they cannot know for sure how jury members interpret events, it is within their control to shape or frame these interpretations. Thus, as one experienced lawyer explained, trials are not as much about presenting the jury with facts as they are about telling a story around those facts and shaping the story on an almost moment-to-moment basis. This lawyer conceded, “I don’t care what the facts are; when I’m in the courtroom, it’s all about me, and I’ve got to put on the right kind of show, the right way” (33). In clarifying this comment, informant 33 explained that part of the “show” he is putting on involves getting the jury members to view events in line with his case. With respect to witness testimony, he stated, “I have to spin—as the word might be—spin what I’m getting from the witness to impress the jury that what they’ve just heard is very significant or not significant.”</p>
<p>More generally, my data indicate that experienced trial lawyers appreciate the ambiguity of courtroom events. As used here, the term “appreciating event ambiguity” encompasses both the broad recognition that courtroom events are oftentimes ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations and the more acute insight that lawyers themselves can shape the event interpretations drawn by jury members (a distinction reflected in the data structure summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0170840612464752">Table 2</xref>). In appreciating event ambiguity, trial lawyers understand there are many possible ways to integrate courtroom events with their overarching theme or story.</p>
<p>These observations should not overshadow the fact that, in at least some instances, the meaning of an event for the outcome of a trial is largely unequivocal. For example, some of my informants discussed instances in which the accused admitted that he or she was guilty or liable—an event that, in essence, put an end to the trial. Moreover, my findings do not indicate that highly experienced lawyers are <italic>always</italic> comfortable with unexpected developments, owing to their appreciation for event ambiguity. After all, even the most experienced lawyers may wish that some events (e.g., key witnesses failing to appear in court) had not occurred during a trial no matter how well they attempted to connect these events to the theme or details of their case. However, what my data <italic>do</italic> suggest is that courtroom events are generally subject to a much wider range of interpretations than meets the eye of the novice trial lawyer. To put this more generally, in a social context filled with unpredictability, events contain several possible interpretations—some of which may prove quite useful, if identified. As discussed below, one’s ability to draw these useful interpretations stems from one’s response repertoire.</p>

<p>As noted, experienced trial lawyers recognize that the way jurors interpret courtroom events is, to some degree, related to how lawyers themselves interpret and respond to these events. However, for lawyers to achieve and maintain a high level of attentional integration, they must not only appreciate the ambiguity of courtroom events; they must also be able to capitalize on that ambiguity. That is, lawyers must have the ability to influence the jury’s interpretations of events in a manner favorable to their case. As it turns out, this ability is another byproduct of trial law experience. Specifically, in accruing experience, trial lawyers develop a repertoire of possible responses to courtroom events. In building this “response repertoire” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840612464752">Weick, 1988</xref>), lawyers become increasingly adept at taking ambiguous events and signaling to jurors that these events fit their case.</p>
<p>A lawyer’s response repertoire may constitute a range of skills. For example, as suggested earlier, lawyers may learn through experience that not all objectionable statements call for objections. In some instances, <italic>not</italic> objecting provides precisely the opportunity they have been looking for. Along these lines, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464752">Table 4</xref> includes a quote from an inexperienced lawyer (02) describing the challenge of “picking battles” in terms of when to object and also includes quotes from experienced lawyers (29 and 42) that provide further evidence for why knowing when—and when not—to object is an important part of a lawyer’s response repertoire as well as how this skill is associated with experience.</p>
<p>Experience may teach lawyers to use objections skillfully in another respect as well. On this point, a highly experienced litigator stated the following.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One reason I object is to let the jury know some type of opinion, or almost have a dialog with the jury. I mean, I might stand up and object, “Your Honor, that is not based on personal knowledge, and it’s irrelevant to the issues the jury has to decide. This guy was not there. He doesn’t know what was said. He’s just speculating.” I’m making a speech to the jury, you know, that’s what I’m doing. (45)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As suggested through this example, informant 45 has developed a particular skill within his response repertoire—using objections to have a “dialog” with the jury—that permits him to see certain situations for what they are to him—namely opportunities.</p>
<p>Another component of experienced lawyers’ response repertoires concerns their ability to <italic>act</italic>. A common form of acting among experienced trial lawyers is acting as though courtroom events align with or buttress one’s case, no matter what the event means from a strictly legal standpoint. For example, a lawyer may portray an event as deeply meaningful when, in fact, it is a relatively minor point given the overall context and details of the case. Along these lines, informant 41 discussed how an otherwise inconsequential statement—such as a police officer testifying that he or she did not attempt to collect fingerprints (in a situation where doing so might not have been feasible)—could be construed in one’s favor by acting like “this is really important and really critical” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464752">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In a similar vein, lawyers may act in response to the judge’s rulings. Informant 16 described his reaction when he first witnessed such acting in practice.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was amazed when I first saw this…It was the lawyer who can make, in front of a jury, can make every decision the judge makes appear to be the one he wanted…In a jury trial [there] are what are called sidebar conferences where the parties go up and there’s an issue before the court and the court doesn’t want the jury to hear about what the deliberation process, so the court makes the ruling in secret. Invariably one side or the other will have lost that argument. [This] lawyer [made] it appear that all is won by the way he walks back to the table, by voice, he says, “Thank you, your Honor.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Informant 16 went on to describe this particular skill—acting like whatever answer you get is the answer you wanted—as a “function of experience,” a skill learned through being in the courtroom and having “seen somebody pull that off.”</p>
<p>While acting skills among trial lawyers might seem commonplace, in actuality many lawyers—particularly inexperienced ones—have not adequately developed the ability to act effectively. This is unfortunate, according to informant 18, because acting may help lawyers avoid situations like the following.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When [unexpected] things happen, [it’s] how you handle it. Some people will just freak out, and their eyes will get real white, and then they’ll just, they don’t know what to do. And they’ll sit down and everybody in the courtroom can pick up on “ooh, that wasn’t good for them.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This statement not only highlights the importance of “knowing what to do” as unexpected situations arise (e.g., acting as though the event is beneficial for—or at least inconsequential to—one’s case), but also reinforces the claim that jury members take their cues from the lawyer to determine whether events have helped or hurt the lawyer’s case.</p>
<p>With that said, my findings do not suggest that relatively inexperienced litigators are unaware of the importance of acting. For example, informant 11 discussed how, when faced with an unexpected development, he tries to “keep a poker face” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464752">Table 4</xref>). However, for the most part, inexperienced trial lawyers described acting as more of a reactionary process than a method for conveying that unfolding events have <italic>strengthened</italic> one’s case. In part, this is perhaps because inexperienced lawyers are less appreciative of the ambiguity of courtroom events and thus more likely to think that unexpected events call for damage control rather than exploitation. As stated by informant 11, “There’s always the initial reaction… ‘Okay, is this as bad as I think it is?’ And then, ‘How do I kind of minimize whatever damage it is?’ I guess I’m always thinking about that in terms of bad things rather than good things.” This reaction is understandable given informant 11’s admission that, when a witness’s testimony goes awry, his “heart sinks” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464752">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, the observations offered in this section indicate that experienced trial lawyers possess a larger response repertoire than neophyte trial lawyers. This matters because, as suggested, large response repertoires may heighten attentional integration. The skills constituting lawyers’ response repertoires (e.g., acting) enable them to take advantage of ambiguous events by crafting interpretations of these events that favor their case. In the absence of a response repertoire, a lawyer may lack the means to integrate ongoing events with the theme of his or her case and, for that matter, may be oblivious to the opportunities that attentional integration might permit. Revealing an awareness of this issue, a relatively inexperienced lawyer bemoaned his inability to spot opportunities that he believed his more experienced counterparts could seize.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What happens is, as you get a lawyer who is…more experienced [and] also more crafty, then you’re not seeing the same things they are. So because they’re just—they’ll have a different perception on things, and you’re fighting a different battle than what they’re fighting. And so, that’s when you’re really at I think a big disadvantage—it’s not just age; it’s more experience. (09)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In short, the response repertoires lawyers gain through experience provide them with the resources necessary to construct useful interpretations of ambiguous events and to identify such opportunities in the first place. Through the discussion that follows, I unpack this point further and consider a number of implications of my findings.</p>

<p><italic>When people expand their repertoire, they improve their alertness.

</disp-quote></p>
<p>In some respects, this claim captures key components of the findings reported here; at the same time, it brings into relief the novelty of these findings vis-a-vis related lines of inquiry. On the former point, through my research I elaborated theory surrounding experience-based qualities of attention in a dynamic work setting (trial law). In doing so, I found that by increasing their capacities—for example, through developing rule-following skills and building a response repertoire—trial lawyers may achieve greater alertness, not simply to events in their work setting but also to the opportunities residing within these events that can be tapped and exploited. This is because the capacities born through experience enhance trial lawyers’ attentional breadth and attentional integration—key qualities of attention in a courtroom.</p>
<p>On the latter point—concerning the novelty of my findings—I found that the “weak signals” in my research context are not always, or even generally, signs of a crisis. Through acquiring experience, trial lawyers tend to move past simplistic conceptions of courtroom events as “harmful” or “helpful” by recognizing that the ultimate meaning of such events is determined at least to some degree by their own interpretations and responses. In this sense, and perhaps dissimilar to contexts involving significant risk of physical harm or disaster (e.g., high reliability organizations—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840612464752">Weick et al., 1999</xref>), trial law is perhaps less about noticing subtle signs of danger and more a matter of seeing how the events one notices can be turned to one’s advantage. Put differently, in a context defined by persuasion or social influence, one may view almost any event opportunistically, depending on the qualities of attention it receives. For this reason, the expression “things seen and unseen” as used in the paper title is as much a statement about interpretation as it is about noticing.</p>
<p>It is also a statement about research on attention. As noted at the outset of this paper, much research has focused on issues concerning the direction of attention. While essential and enduring, such research has obscured from view matters concerning the qualities of attention. By turning the spotlight toward this topic, the study reported here illuminates specific qualities of attention (i.e., attentional breadth and attentional integration) that have received only limited scholarly consideration and reveals avenues by which these qualities may be enhanced via experience.</p>
<p>Collectively, my findings carry a range of implications. In particular, these findings expand the catalog of qualities of attention and provide a basis for comparing one quality of attention to another—a task I undertake below. Furthermore, as I later highlight, the concepts of attentional breadth and attention integration that surfaced through my study connect to and inform a number of lines of organizational scholarship.</p>
<sec id="section19-0170840612464752">
<title>Cataloging qualities of attention</title>
<p>My findings point to attentional breadth and attentional integration as key qualities of attention in trial law. These qualities of attention both complement and build upon previous research surrounding attentional qualities, and invite comparisons that may help scholars develop a more comprehensive typology of attention and its qualities. Perhaps most fundamentally, some qualities of attention may be primarily related to noticing events while others are more directly linked to interpreting events. As my findings suggest, attentional breadth fits the former category while attentional integration is paradigmatic of the latter.</p>
<p>By its nature, attentional breadth entails attending to a wide range or spectrum of events. In this sense, it is concerned with noticing and, more specifically, with noticing more rather than less. The claim that attentional breadth represents a quality of attention is important as it brackets this concept from research on the direction of attention. Attentional breadth implies that, although a number of people may be attending to the same scene (i.e., their attention is generally focused in the same direction), some may be capturing more scene-related events than others. For this reason, it represents a notable quality of attention—one that, as argued, may be conducive to performance in dynamic work settings. At a neurocognitive level, attentional breadth is perhaps buttressed by executive attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840612464752">Rueda et al., 2005</xref>). Executive attention permits individuals to switch between stimuli in rapid succession, thus pursuing multiple, though related, objectives almost simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612464752">Ocasio, 2011</xref>). Through further research, scholars might demonstrate direct linkages between attentional breadth and executive attention.</p>
<p>Attentional breadth is not the only quality of attention pertinent to noticing. As discussed earlier, scholars have discussed another such quality of attention—attentional stability. While attentional stability—which implies steadfast, unwavering attention to a particular target or object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612464752">Weick &amp; Sutcliffe, 2006</xref>)—did not emerge from my data in the same fashion as attentional breadth, it is nevertheless plausible that attentional stability does, in fact, matter in the courtroom (as well as in other dynamic environments). After all, in the absence of at least some level of attentional stability, events may go unregistered even when attention is directed their way. This point is perhaps implicit in lawyers’ remarks on the importance of listening carefully to what witnesses are saying and watching what other people in the courtroom are doing. Most likely, certain features of the research context led attentional breadth and not attentional stability to emerge prominently in my data. As discussed, a critical attention-related challenge trial lawyers encounter is focusing their attention widely enough to capture a number of ongoing events—a challenge that calls for a high level of attentional breadth. Even so, these observations suggest an important point of clarification. Namely, attentional breadth and attentional stability are not necessarily at odds. One quality facilitates noticing more events; the other helps to ensure that the details of noticed events are registered in full.</p>
<p>Next, the other quality of attention that surfaced in my study—attentional integration—bears considering. As suggested by my findings, attentional integration is linked to the interpretation side of attention. In this sense, attentional integration may be related to attentional vividness. As discussed earlier, attentional vividness concerns the richness or complexity of representations one applies to events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612464752">Weick &amp; Sutcliffe, 2006</xref>). In other words, it is an interpretation-related quality of attention. What makes attentional integration unique, however, is that it is story directed. In other words, it involves identifying how ongoing events may equate with the message, theme, or story one seeks to convey. As such, attentional integration is of particular relevance for tasks involving influence, persuasion, or storytelling. To some degree, one may find such tasks in negotiations, sales, teaching, political debate, and certain leadership situations (e.g., “town hall” meetings).</p>
<p>Attentional integration is also noteworthy in that it shapes whether individuals construe events as “good” or “bad.” Indeed, owing to different levels of attentional integration, a trial law veteran might well interpret an event viewed as bad by a neophyte trial lawyer as good. With a nod to Shakespeare, it is perhaps generally true that, in a dynamic work environment rife with storytelling or social influence, “there’s nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” For this very reason, the presence—or the absence—of attentional integration exerts a fundamental influence on whether one interprets unfolding events as boon or as bane.</p>
<p>Beyond informing existing theory focusing on the qualities of attention, the specific qualities uncovered through my study—attentional breadth and attentional integration—contribute to and, in some respects, challenge related lines of scholarship in management and organizational studies. Taking stock of this point, I examine below the implications of each quality of attention across a number of research domains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0170840612464752">
<title>Implications concerning attentional breadth</title>
<p>Before one can interpret events, one must first notice them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612464752">Starbuck &amp; Milliken, 1988</xref>). My findings suggest that trial lawyers are able to attend to a larger number of events in the courtroom as their attentional breadth widens with experience. As described here, the increase in attentional breadth associated with experience occurs through a reduction in stress and an increase in rule-following automaticity. Each of these mechanisms deserves further comment. With regard to stress, my findings suggest that high stress levels compromise attentional breadth (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0170840612464752">Staw, Sandelands, &amp; Dutton, 1981</xref>). Even so, my findings do not necessarily imply that stress and attentional breadth are inversely related. On the contrary, it is possible that some baseline of stress helps individuals view their surroundings broadly. For example, in the near absence of stress, boredom may arise. This may cause a redirection of attention toward targets such as daydreams or fantasies largely disconnected from the details of one’s surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840612464752">Kane et al., 2007</xref>). That said, my data do not speak to the effect of low levels of stress on attentional breadth because my informants viewed stress as an inherent aspect of most cases they tried. Even lawyers who had tried many cases mentioned that they still feel some degree of stress during their trials. More generally, it is worth noting that many dynamic performance contexts are, by their very nature, stressful settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840612464752">Brehmer, 1992</xref>). Thus, for individuals operating in dynamic contexts there seems to be a greater likelihood that high rather than low stress will detract from attentional breadth.</p>
<p>The connection between automatic rule following and attentional breadth also merits discussion. Some lines of research suggest that the acquisition of skill automaticity may lead individuals to mentally depart from the present moment and devote thought to recollections of the past or expectations about the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840612464752">Smallwood &amp; Schooler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840612464752">Wood, Quinn, &amp; Kashy, 2002</xref>). As such, one might assume that rule-following automaticity would <italic>narrow</italic> attentional breadth in trial law. It seems likely, however, that particular features of my research context may account for why I found that automaticity enhances rather than limits attentional breadth. Perhaps most fundamentally, because courtroom trials are dynamic environments, a lawyer’s performance depends on noticing a large number of events. Hence, trial lawyers tend to focus the attention freed via rule-following automaticity to the myriad courtroom events surrounding them, as opposed to mentally withdrawing from the situation. More generally, many dynamic situations—including not only courtroom trials but also emergency response operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840612464752">Drabek, 1985</xref>) and organizational crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840612464752">Weick, 1988</xref>)—involve high stakes, rendering it costly to withdraw attention from unfolding events.</p>
<p>The enhancing effect of automaticity on attentional breadth witnessed here dovetails with research observations made in other dynamic environments. For example, as individuals develop proficiency in driving an automobile, their driving skills become increasingly automatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840612464752">Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus, 2005</xref>). This automaticity frees attentional resources and thus permits drivers to attend to a wide range of stimuli such as road conditions and other vehicles. Likewise, improvisational stage actors learn and internalize a set of principles such as the “rule of agreement”—the notion that one should never disagree with or act counter to a suggestion offered by another. In learning to apply such rules automatically, improvisational actors free attention such that they can focus more widely on the actions surrounding them rather than solely on what to say next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840612464752">Vera &amp; Crossan, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, scholars have proposed that, at an organizational level, relatively “less-mindful” (or automatic) practices may enhance attentiveness to unexpected cues or events and permit organizations to respond flexibly as such events arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840612464752">Levinthal &amp; Rerup, 2006</xref>). My findings complement such claims by suggesting that the effect of automatic practices on attentional breadth may hold at an individual level of analysis as well. As such, my research hints at the microfoundations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0170840612464752">Rerup &amp; Feldman, 2011</xref>) of certain qualities of attention (e.g., attentional breadth) one might find in certain organizations. More broadly, my findings suggest that in some contexts automaticity girds, rather than erodes, attentional breadth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0170840612464752">
<title>Implications concerning attentional integration</title>
<p>While attentional breadth facilitates noticing more events, attentional integration enables individuals to recognize the opportunities such events present. My findings indicate that, at least in trial law, attentional integration becomes more common as individuals accrue relevant work experience. I found that two mechanisms account for this link: appreciating event ambiguity and building a response repertoire. While the former mechanism pertains to the insight that the meanings associated with courtroom events are not independent of how lawyers respond to these events, the latter mechanism concerns the skills that permit lawyers to capitalize on this insight. Thus, in gaining trial experience, lawyers not only become adept at seeing events in a self-serving manner (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840612464752">Rudolph, Morrison, &amp; Carroll, 2009</xref>), they also become active “sensegivers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840612464752">Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991</xref>), communicating to jurors the meanings of ongoing events as they relate to and reinforce the case they put forward.</p>
<p>This connection to sensegiving raises the possibility that beyond the storytelling and persuasion-related contexts noted earlier, attentional integration may be relevant to more traditional occupational and organizational settings as well—settings in which sensegiving and related processes such as narrative construction and issue selling have received scholarly investigation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840612464752">Dunford &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612464752">Dutton, Ashford, O’Neill, Hayes, &amp; Wierba, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612464752">Maitlis &amp; Lawrence, 2007</xref>). Research suggests that sensegiving may constitute an “integrative” activity. For example, during organizational change efforts, senior managers construct narratives that serve to integrate ongoing organizational events with the broader change-related objectives they aim to promote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0170840612464752">Sonenshein, 2010</xref>). Similarly, in attempting to convince top managers to attend to specific issues, middle managers may attempt to integrate or “bundle” their issues of concern with agendas or goals already receiving traction in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612464752">Dutton, Ashford, O’Neill, &amp; Lawrence, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Dynamic performance contexts, such as trial law, may amplify the challenges of sensegiving. As noted, dynamic settings call for rapid and adaptive decision making and offer little time for reflection. These settings expose an under-explored feature of sensegiving—its attentional foundations. My findings indicate that, to some degree, sensegiving is rooted in attentional integration. That is, to construct a compelling narrative or sell an issue one must be able to see opportunities for integrating an observed event with the broader story one seeks to tell. The litigators in my sample reported becoming more capable of doing this through the experiences they accrued. More generally, this raises the possibility that sensegiving behaviors exhibited in organizations are rooted not only in leadership agendas and vested interests, but also in the experiences accrued by sensegiving actors.</p>
<p>Despite the potentially wide-ranging applications of attentional integration and its role in sensegiving, this particular quality of attention may nonetheless be more useful in some task domains than others. As suggested, in trial law the interpretations drawn by lawyers (and jurors) grant meaning to events. While interpretation is likewise critical to the construction of event-related meanings by organizational decision makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612464752">George, Chattopadhyay, Sitkin, &amp; Barden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840612464752">Jackson &amp; Dutton, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840612464752">Plambeck &amp; Weber, 2010</xref>), trial law is somewhat distinct in that, due to its storytelling and persuasion foundations, what represents a threat to one lawyer could be interpreted just as legitimately as an opportunity by one operating at a higher level of attentional integration. This is because there is little or no industry or field-level “environment” beyond the courtroom itself. Therefore, as noted earlier, the demands associated with trial law are rather different from those concerned with spotting potential signals of organizational crisis. Of course, even in a crisis situation, interpretation-related processes may either amplify or attenuate the magnitude of the crisis insofar as managerial interpretations shape organizational responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840612464752">Weick, 1988</xref>) and, ultimately, organizational learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840612464752">Rerup, 2009</xref>). However, when it comes to crisis avoidance or mitigation, attentional integration may not be the most desirable quality of attention. While attentional integration may engender a level of opportunism useful in contexts driven by storytelling or persuasion, this quality of attention may also prevent one from interpreting events as potential threats when it is critical to do precisely that (e.g., scanning for weak signals that portend a potential crisis). This suggests that, as useful as attentional integration appears to be in trial law, it may carry risks worth considering in certain task domains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0170840612464752">
<title>Limitations and future research</title>
<p>Inductive studies are often thought to be limited in their generalizability to other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840612464752">Eisenhardt &amp; Graebner, 2007</xref>) and the present study is no exception. Even so, there is some likelihood that these findings will generalize to other professions and occupations involving storytelling or persuasion (e.g., negotiations, debate). Further research is needed, however, to verify this possibility. In addition, it is unclear whether the findings presented here would hold in non-dynamic settings. This is a key issue because people do not always operate in dynamic work environments. Indeed, litigators often perform tasks under relatively non-dynamic conditions including preparing witnesses for trials, crafting opening and closing statements, and making pre-trial motions. As such, research is needed to examine whether and how experience is connected to attentional breadth and attentional integration in non-dynamic or “static” settings.</p>
<p>Next, it bears noting that my data do not permit causal inferences (e.g., reduced stress <italic>causes</italic> wide attentional breadth). Therefore, although my informants <italic>perceived</italic> causal relationships between job experience and specific qualities of attention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0170840612464752">Figure 1</xref>), I have taken care to avoid causal language wherever possible. For example, I avoided using the terms “positive relationship” and “negative relationship” (terms associated with a theory testing, quantitative research approach). Through further research, particularly longitudinal studies, scholars could test the causal structure of the connections between work experience and various qualities of attention.</p>
<p>Along related lines, scholars have noted specific limitations associated with using self-report data (e.g., research interviews) to capture cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840612464752">Nisbett &amp; Wilson, 1977</xref>). For example, personal accounts of cognitive-level phenomena are vulnerable to memory errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840612464752">Schacter, 1999</xref>) and may yield incomplete representations of the phenomena being studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0170840612464752">Robinson &amp; Clore, 2002</xref>). As such, my informants’ descriptions of the qualities of attention—and the experience-based mechanisms associated with them—are subject to questions concerning veridicality fundamentally linked to the research methodology employed. Perhaps by adopting other methodologies, such as neurophysiological approaches, researchers could circumvent these limitations and develop an account of attention and its qualities that either validates or challenges the findings reported here.</p>
<p>Finally, although my data suggest fairly direct connections between trial law experience and the attentional qualities of note (via the mechanisms described here), it is possible that certain factors may influence the extent to which experience shapes these qualities of attention either within my research setting or in other occupational contexts. In evaluating this possibility, researchers could examine whether factors such as “reflective learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840612464752">Schön, 1983</xref>) or “learning goal orientation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840612464752">Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988</xref>) influence how rapidly or comprehensively individuals develop attentional breadth or attentional integration as they accrue job-related experience.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite emerging interest in the topic, the qualities that attention may take on have received limited investigation. Through the study reported here, I explored qualities of attention pertinent to individuals working in a dynamic setting. In doing so, I identified two key qualities—attentional breadth and attentional integration—and revealed experience-related mechanisms through which these qualities may arise. Of particular note, I found that, within the focal context, how attention is brought to bear determines the distinction between threats and opportunities. This suggests that, in achieving certain qualities of attention, individuals are able to see not only more events but also more possibilities.</p>
