<abstract>
<p>The importance of life scripts and identity change in the desistance process has been well documented in recent years. Such scripts involve the construction of a narrative which leads the would-be desister towards a new non-offending identity. Accounts of these subjective changes are frequently regarded in the existent literature as being the culmination of the desistance process – the final phase in the journey away from crime. This article examines the role of narrative and identity change from the perspective of individuals who might be considered to be in the primary desistance phase of the journey away from crime. The article presents findings from a qualitative study of early transitions towards desistance, among a group of males under probation supervision. It is argued that identity reconstruction begins during the early phases of desistance, and recommendations are made in relation to policy and practice.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1462474513477790" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Desistance from crime, or the study of how formerly persistent offenders move away from offending behaviour, has become a key field of criminological research in recent years (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474513477790">Bushway et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474513477790">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1462474513477790">Laub and Sampson, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1462474513477790">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1462474513477790">Laub et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1462474513477790">Loeber et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474513477790">Maruna, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1462474513477790">Sampson and Laub, 2005</xref>). However, despite the burgeoning interest, there remains a lack of clarity with regard to the definition and conceptualization of the term. Some have argued that the lack of agreement regarding the term has impeded research into desistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1462474513477790">Bottoms et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474513477790">Bushway et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474513477790">Maruna, 2001</xref>). In some respects, the lack of clarity with regards to the definition of desistance is a symptom of the range of operational definitions employed within various research projects (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1462474513477790">Kazemian, 2007</xref>: 8–9). Key questions have emerged regarding the way in which it is possible to identify when someone has begun to desist and, perhaps more importantly, when they have successfully achieved desistance. This has, in turn, led some to establish alternative conceptualizations of desistance, which are distinguishable based upon the length of time the individual has refrained from offending and the subjective changes that they have experienced at the individual level. One such conceptualization has been offered which distinguishes between lulls in offending behaviour (‘primary desistance’) and the longer-term maintenance of non-offending, accompanied by a change in identity (‘secondary desistance’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1462474513477790">Maruna and Farrall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1462474513477790">Maruna et al., 2004a</xref>). According to the existing literature, an important aspect of secondary desistance is the role of narrative in helping to construct the new identities which accompany the change from ‘offender’ to ‘non-offender’, and this helps to maintain desistance through conditioning individual’s action in the present context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1462474513477790">Vaughan, 2007</xref>). Accounts of these subjective changes are frequently regarded as being the culmination of the desistance process – the final phase in the journey away from crime (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474513477790">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, relatively little attention has been paid to primary desistance in the broader literature, yet questions remain about the nature of early forays towards desistance. Despite the growing body of literature on desistance, various questions remain, such as: how do individuals navigate the initial transition towards desistance? How do individuals plan to sustain their moves away from crime? And how do individuals respond to the early challenges to their attempts to desist? This article focuses on a narrower range of questions, relating to the role of narrative construction in the early stages of desistance. In doing so it will seek to explore questions such as: what prompts narrative change? How does it begin? And who is involved in its development? As this article is concerned with the early transitions towards desistance, it proceeds by outlining the distinction between primary and secondary desistance before turning attention towards the role of narrative in the desistance process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1462474513477790"><title>Primary and secondary desistance</title>
<p>Many commentators would agree upon the meaning of desistance in its simplest form as termination of, or cessation from, offending. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474513477790">Maruna (2001</xref>: 22) suggests that ‘the criminal career literature traditionally imagines desistance as an event – an abrupt cessation of criminal behaviour’, yet this ignores the fact that criminal activity is sporadic, and that offenders have a tendency to drift or ‘zig-zag’ in and out of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1462474513477790">Glaser, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1462474513477790">Matza, 1964</xref>). Evidence from the desistance research shows that many initial attempts to desist are unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1462474513477790">Maruna, 1997</xref>) and, as such, it is rather the case that desistance does not occur abruptly, but that instances of reversals and relapses are likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1462474513477790">Burnett, 2004</xref>: 169). Thus, some commentators have sought to provide conceptual clarity to the subject area by distinguishing between the termination of offending as the outcome of desistance, and the underlying processes which lead to a continued state of non-offending (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1462474513477790">Laub and Sampson, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The delineation of separate categorical phases of desistance advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1462474513477790">Maruna et al. (2004a)</xref> has, perhaps, been regarded as the most innovative development in providing clarity to the notion of desistance as a process. The notion of primary and secondary desistance draws from the work of Edwin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1462474513477790">Lemert (1951</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1462474513477790">1967</xref>). Lemert discerned two categorical phases in the transition towards deviance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1462474513477790">Lemert (1951</xref>: 11) suggested that primary deviance was considered to be ‘the initial flirtation and experimentation with deviant behaviours’, while secondary deviance involves deviance becoming ‘incorporated as part of the “me” of the individual’. In a similar respect, there are two distinct phases of desistance. Primary desistance refers to a lull or break in criminal behaviour, while secondary desistance refers to ‘the movement from the behaviour of non-offending to the assumption of the role or identity of a “changed person”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1462474513477790">Maruna et al., 2004a</xref>: 19). There is evidence to suggest that desistance is accompanied by a change in identity, from that of ‘offender’ to ‘non-offender’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474513477790">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474513477790">Maruna, 2001</xref>). As individuals experience such a change, they come to regard criminal activity as incompatible with their new identity, while simultaneously distancing themselves from their past identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1462474513477790">Vaughan, 2007</xref>: 394). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1462474513477790">Maruna et al. (2004a)</xref> argue that, because lulls in offending behaviour occur periodically throughout a criminal career, primary desistance is of little theoretical interest. As such, the focus of research should be upon secondary desistance, examining the process by which an individual was able to ‘become’ an ex-offender.</p>
<p>However, the conceptualization of primary and secondary desistance may not offer as much clarity as might have been previously assumed. There are several pertinent reasons for studying the early phases of desistance (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1462474513477790">Healy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474513477790">Healy and O’Donnell, 2008</xref>), not least because only a proportion of primary desisters make the transition to secondary desistance, and therefore research which explores individual experiences during the early stages of desistance can provide useful insights into how this transition might be achieved. However, it is precisely this conceptualization of the transition from primary to secondary desistance which is problematic here. Secondary desistance is presented as an ‘end state’, the culmination of the desistance journey which results in the individual regarding themselves, and perhaps more importantly being regarded by others, as an ‘ex-offender’. There is limited acknowledgement in this conceptualization that individuals might be able to achieve secondary desistance, but then return to offending behaviour again. Nor is there an acknowledgement that individuals might be able to achieve what is commonly identified as ‘secondary desistance’ while still retaining certain characteristics or behaviours which may have been prominent during the ‘offender’ or ‘primary desistance’ phases of the self. Indeed, secondary desistance itself is only ever a provisional state of being. Research which examines the nature of narrative and identity during the later stages of desistance is extremely important, but so too is research which examines the way in which individuals envision their futures, the social and structural barriers and supports that they identify, and the way in which individuals seek to adapt or reconstruct their identities as they embark on their desistance journeys.</p>
<p>Primary and secondary desistance have been conceptualized as discreet moments in the overall desistance process, but this delineation has been based, largely, upon the retrospective accounts of those who have successfully desisted over a sustained period of time. There is little, if any, empirical evidence to support the view that these are distinct phases of the desistance process, but rather it is argued here that elements of secondary desistance may occur much earlier than has previously been suggested, and aspects of primary desistance may endure much later in the overall desistance process. The studies upon which the distinction between primary and secondary desistance are based have usually been retrospective in nature, yet research which explores desistance contemporaneously, such as that which informs this article (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474513477790">Bottoms and Shapland, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1462474513477790">Healy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1462474513477790">Shapland and Bottoms, 2011</xref>), may be able to offer new insights into the desistance process.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1462474513477790"><title>The role of narrative and identity change in desistance</title>
<p>The capacity of individuals to resituate themselves and their identities, and subsequently to alter various forms of social activity, has emerged as a central theme within accounts of late-modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1462474513477790">May and Cooper, 1995</xref>). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1462474513477790">Giddens (1998</xref>: 37), under conditions of late-modernity individuals must live in a more reflective manner, which can generate new possibilities of thought and action. This suggests that individuals are regarded as being responsible for their own destiny, and it is assumed that they have the power to change the conditions in which they live if they choose to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1462474513477790">Greener, 2002</xref>: 692–693). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1462474513477790">Giddens (1998</xref>: 37): ‘We have to make our lives in a more active way than was true of previous generations, and we need more actively to accept responsibilities for the consequences of what we do and the lifestyle habits we adopt.’</p>
<p>Indeed, ‘modern guidelines actually compel the self-organization and self-thematization of people’s biographies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1462474513477790">Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002</xref>: 31). This suggests that the formulation of identity is an ongoing process involving continual revision, evaluation and reformulation of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474513477790">Archer, 2007</xref>). Identity, when regarded as ‘the self’, therefore, is mutable and contingent upon relations with other actors and the challenges of social structures and routinized actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474513477790">Archer, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474513477790">2003</xref>). However, identity also entails the construction and maintenance of an ongoing narrative which ‘conjoins, in a personally (and probably socially) acceptable and plausible way, the disparate elements of one’s life and the past to the present’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1462474513477790">Stevens, 2012</xref>). Therefore, narratives are constituted of subjectively meaningful life-course events, which are internalized and reconstructed to provide coherence and understanding to the life as a whole. This is of particular importance under the chaotic and potentially overwhelming conditions of modern society, wherein individuals require a sense of coherence and order, and it is the autobiographical narrative which provides this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474513477790">Giddens, 1991</xref>). Thus, narrative identities perform two broad functions. On the one hand, they condition future social interaction and behaviour, as individuals will act in ways which are aligned to the narratives that they have constructed for themselves. On the other, narratives are conditioned by social structure and social interaction, so particular life-course events can alter the internalized autobiography in ways that can have an impact upon future behaviour, actions and identities. Some events will allow for continuity within the identity and narrative, whereas others will prompt re-evaluation, revision and questioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1462474513477790">McAdams, 1985</xref>), in order to maintain overall coherence, and this may entail subsequent identity change in order to fit with the altered narrative. Such re-evaluation is likely to occur when existing narratives and identities are challenged, often in the aftermath of particular life-course events (for example changes to marital or employment status) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1462474513477790">Pals, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Within desistance theory, narrative and identity change have been widely acknowledged as playing a crucial role in changing values, morals and beliefs such that individuals are more capable of moving away from crime despite the significant structural barriers they may face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1462474513477790">Barry, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1462474513477790">Marsh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1462474513477790">Presser, 2009</xref>). A number of authors have commented that narratives are important in helping individuals to account for past criminal behaviour, and in explaining how individuals have become a reformed character with a new pro-social identity (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1462474513477790">Burnett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1462474513477790">Gadd and Farrall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474513477790">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1462474513477790">Laub and Sampson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474513477790">Maruna, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1462474513477790">Vaughan, 2007</xref>). However, most desistance studies have tended to explore the role of narrative and identity change from the perspective of individuals who have achieved secondary desistance.</p>
<p>Secondary desistance, as detailed above, is taken to reflect a change in identity from that of ‘offender’ to one of ‘non-offender’. As individuals experience such a change, they come to regard criminal activity as incompatible with their new identity, while simultaneously distancing themselves from their past identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1462474513477790">Vaughan, 2007</xref>: 394). The nature of this change is one whereby individuals come to regard their past actions in a different way, such that for the would-be desister there is an ‘acquisition of an altered perspective on their youthful self and activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1462474513477790">Shover, 1996</xref>: 131). As such, it has been argued that desistance is more likely to result from changes in an individual’s ‘self-identity and worldview’, which may include alterations to their commitments, concerns and needs such that they are incompatible with their past identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1462474513477790">Maruna and Roy, 2007</xref>: 115). It is this distinction between past, present and future identities which, for many, is at the heart of desistance journeys, and it is the building of a desistance narrative which underpins the development of new identities.</p>
<p>Narratives are important within the desistance process as they serve three crucial functions. First, they provide some subjective distancing from past events, which may include recognition of the harms caused by particular behaviours. Second, they can help the would-be desister to elicit meaning from particular life-course events, or ‘turning points’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1462474513477790">Sampson and Laub, 2005</xref>). Third, they can facilitate the construction of new non-offending identities. It is the importance of meaning attached to particular events, commitments or desires within narratives which aids the desistance process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1462474513477790">Vaughan (2007)</xref> argues that narratives of desistance cannot simply be a reconstruction or recollection of past events, but rather that there needs to be some moral assessment of past behaviours in order to allow the would-be desister to reconstruct their present and future identities in such a way that will allow for the maintenance of non-offending behaviour. The narrative needs to show how past actions make sense to the individual recalling them, but they cannot simply be an internalized perspective on the causes and effects of past behaviour. There needs also to be an externalized perspective on past behaviour which allows the would-be desister to pass judgement on their actions and evaluate them accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1462474513477790">Vaughan, 2007</xref>: 398). This externalization of the past, and the emotional responses elicited as a consequence, allow for the narrative construction of a possible future.</p>
<p>In a similar respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1462474513477790">Paternoster and Bushway (2009</xref>: 1107–1108) argue that would-be desisters need to ‘cast off’ old identities in favour of alternative versions of the self. These authors argue that this process provides both a motivational and deterrent effect which can facilitate desistance. Individuals may envision two versions of the self: a ‘possible self’ and a ‘feared self’. The former is the person that they could become if they make changes in their lives, and this is the identity that they are motivated towards. The latter, by contrast, is the person that they could become if they continue to offend, and this identity deters the individual from persistent offending behaviour. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1462474513477790">Harris (2011)</xref> similarly notes that desisters may draw upon negative accounts of the past self to inform the potential future self that the individual could become, given the propitious structural and cultural environments required. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474513477790">Giordano et al. (2002)</xref> also draw attention to the importance of the structural environment in accounting for the role of various cognitive transformations in the desistance process. They argue that the individual needs to: (1) be open to the possibility of change; (2) perceive an available ‘hook’ for change; (3) envision a suitable replacement self; and (4) develop a new perception of offending behaviour which does not cohere with a continuing criminal lifestyle. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474513477790">Giordano et al. (2002)</xref> argue that these cognitive transformations depend upon the ‘agentic moves’ of the individual concerned. Finally, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474513477790">Maruna’s (2001)</xref> Liverpool Desistance Study, the narratives of 30 desisting offenders and those of 20 active offenders were compared. The two groups shared similar backgrounds and criminogenic characteristics, but offered narrative accounts which were fundamentally different in important respects. While both groups saw their past selves as being victims of circumstance, persistent offenders lived by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474513477790">Maruna (2001)</xref> called a ‘condemnation script’. Within this, active offenders regarded their future outlooks as being bleak, ‘they claim to have a clear picture of the “good life” but do not feel they have the ability to get there using their own volition’ (2001: 83). Desisters, on the other hand, undertook self-reconstruction of the ‘true self’ in order to develop a non-offending identity (2001: 89). The development of this new identity would allow the individual to accomplish ‘what he or she was “always meant to do”’ (2001: 87).</p>
<p>Thus, there is much empirical evidence to support the argument that narratives and identity change are highly significant to the overall desistance process. However, these accounts suggest a ‘consistent self’ to which individuals dedicate themselves. Such accounts, implicitly at least, suggest a degree of consistency in the structuring and ordering of life events and life scripts to which would-be desisters will cohere. In this respect, existing conceptualizations of narrative and identity correspond to the distinction between primary and secondary desistance. In order to achieve secondary desistance, individuals would need to construct a consistent self which would allow them to adopt the identity of ‘ex-offender’. Yet this level of consistency is highly unlikely when faced with the challenges of poverty, social exclusion, multiple disadvantage and substance misuse. Therefore, such accounts of narrative and identity reconstruction are unlikely to be able to explain how individuals might maintain desistance when faced with situations which challenge their narratives. Moreover, these accounts do not allow for the possibility that individuals might be able to act in ways which are contrary to the narratives that they are constructing, and the identities which they are attempting to acquire, and yet still maintain desistance from crime. For example, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474513477790">Giordano et al.’s (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1462474513477790">Paternoster and Bushway’s (2009)</xref> accounts suggest that the desisting identity must be a replacement self which is fundamentally different from the previous ‘offending self’. Yet this does not allow for the possibility that certain characteristics or behaviours previously associated with the ‘offending self’ may endure while the individual continues to maintain a state of non-offending.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as many of the studies which have focused upon this particular line of enquiry involve research conducted with individuals who may be considered to be experiencing secondary desistance, there are some areas which require further investigation. As is the case within the broader criminological literature, a common theme in desistance research is that those individuals who have previously been involved in criminal careers have often experienced significant degrees of poverty and social exclusion. Therefore, it is unclear how some individuals are more capable than others of making the initial moves towards narrative and identity reconstruction, given the constraining effects of the structural environments in which they live. It is argued here that by exploring the narratives of those who are currently in the primary phase of desistance we might gain a greater understanding of the way in which individuals construct their narratives, and the impact that social and cultural contexts can have upon this.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1462474513477790"><title>Data collection and analysis methods</title>
<p>A qualitative research strategy was employed in order to gather the data required for the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a group of 20 individuals under probation supervision in England. Probation officers recruited participants in accordance with the sampling criteria. In order to try to ensure that the sample might best be considered as early desisters, individuals with a minimum of one month’s experience of probation supervision, but less than two years’ probation supervision, and who did not self-report any offending were recruited. It is acknowledged that self-reporting is an inaccurate indicator of desistance, and since this research was undertaken others have developed alternative means of identifying self-report data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474513477790">Bottoms and Shapland, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1462474513477790">Shapland and Bottoms, 2011</xref>). Self-reporting may also be problematic when interviews take place at local probation offices, as is often the case in research of this nature. Participants may be sceptical of the researcher, and may be wary of their supervising officer becoming aware of any offending or offending-related behaviour. Indeed, in this research, a few participants initially believed that the researcher was a probation officer, and this could clearly affect participants’ responses.</p>
<p>The sample was limited to those aged over 18, but without an upper age limit. Finally, the participants needed to have a minimum of two previous convictions. Four of those originally recruited either withdrew or did not attend for the interview, and only one female was recruited. Consequently an all male, predominantly white British sample was used for data analysis. The distribution of offence types and sentences received were broadly consistent with national data, and the personal and social characteristics of the participants were consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1462474513477790">Harper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1462474513477790">Mair and May, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1462474513477790">Rex, 1999</xref>). Participants were recruited by their supervising officers, which may suggest some selection bias. However, there was a broad correlation between sample characteristics and available national data, and several of the emerging themes confirm findings from existing studies. Thus, while it is not possible to argue that the sample is representative, nor that the findings are necessarily generalizable, it is possible to argue that the data are valid and reliable and that they offer some useful insights into the early stages of desistance.</p>
<p>Interviews lasted for between 45 minutes and almost two hours. Participants were asked a range of questions in relation to their experiences of probation, their offending history and their plans or goals for the future. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, and were subsequently analysed using a thematic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474513477790">Attride-Sterling, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474513477790">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). None of the participants indicated that they had offended since their previous conviction, but it is acknowledged that self-report data are an inadequate indicator of desistance from crime. Therefore, the interviews were analysed using indicators of desistance found in existing narrative accounts, such as those identified earlier in this article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1462474513477790"><title>Findings</title>
<p>Participants had begun to construct early desistance narratives as they sought to distance themselves from past actions and behaviour, and sought to identify alternative future identities and potential courses of action that could facilitate longer-term moves away from crime. While the nature and depth of narratives varied across the sample, individuals’ accounts suggested that the emergence of a sense of clarity surrounding past events provided a turning point which allowed a new narrative to emerge focused around early desistance. This clarity was often acknowledged in terms of the individual having a lack of power or autonomy over their actions, which may be regarded as the individual seeking to distance themselves from a past identity as part of the construction of a new narrative of desistance. This was then reinforced with a new sense of moral agency which corroborated the new identity that individuals wanted to establish. Participants suggested that the achievement of this new identity would be dependent upon particular changes to their personal and social contexts, but also upon the testimony of others.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1462474513477790"><title>Acquiring clarity about past events</title>
<p>The development of the desistance narrative appeared to be strongly associated with a greater understanding of past offending, particularly the impact of actions upon victims and other significant others: ‘I felt very remorseful for the people that I caused injuries to. Obviously I can’t talk to the people, but if I could see them I’d say sorry to them’ (Josh). Such feelings of remorse could be developed within the narrative towards more positive acclamations about the move away from crime: ‘I’ve hurt a lot of people in the past, robbing off ‘em, beating’ em up, whatever, and, when you understand that, it’s a good feeling knowing that people aren’t being hurt by you no more’ (Kurt).</p>
<p>This appears to suggest that, in the narrative-building process, some individuals are able to draw upon the clarity gained from understanding the negative effects of past behaviour and begin to construct the narrative in such a way that the present and future sense of self is constructed with a more positive tone. Where past behaviour was discussed this was frequently accounted for in terms of the individual feeling a sense of powerlessness, or a lack of autonomy, over their past actions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1462474513477790"><title>Lack of power/autonomy over actions</title>
<p>For many individuals, the desistance narratives that were beginning to be constructed suggested a certain degree of powerlessness over their past actions. Often this was related to drug or alcohol misuse, and individuals articulated almost a sense of inevitability about the association with their offending behaviour:<disp-quote>
<p>That’s been a problem throughout my life, yeah. Like I say, I genuinely can’t think of a case where I’ve been in trouble with the police without it being me drinking. So that’s the root of it all I think. Hence, stopping and not drinking no more, so hopefully I won’t get in trouble again. Never say never, but I’m hopeful. (Nath)</p>
<p>Obviously when I was doing them [drugs] I was getting into trouble, and like I say I was high when I done this offence, so coming off ‘em has to be a good thing really. And like I say, I’m done with ‘em and I’m not really interested in going back to ‘em. (Leroy)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Acquiring a sense of understanding about the relationship between drug or alcohol misuse and the impact on offending behaviour appeared to prompt a re-evaluation of the life narrative, such that changes to the life-course became more likely:<disp-quote>
<p>That’s the type of thing that you do, when you’re under the influence, whether it’s driving or fighting or thieving or whatever it might be. It’s about a careless attitude, and once you get to understand that it was quite easy for me to stop drinking, virtually. (Tom)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For others, peer associations were imbued with a sense of powerlessness or lack of autonomy:<disp-quote>
<p>I know the people I’m with now wouldn’t get me into any trouble. But back then, it was just everyone I was with was up for it, and you couldn’t not go along. When I did this offence, I was with the same crowd. (Ryan)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For many this aspect of the desistance narrative suggests that being able to take control over one’s future, or acquiring some degree of power over the life-course, is an important aspect in forging a desistance narrative. One particular aspect of this new sense of control emerged with a newly acquired sense of moral agency, which was related to a new identity that the individual wanted to adopt in the future.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1462474513477790"><title>Moral agency/identity</title>
<p>The early desistance narratives also appeared to project a developing sense of moral agency, as individuals began to distance themselves from their past self and distinguished between this and their present and future selves:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t want to be like how I used to be, do you know what I mean? I just don’t want to be like that no more. I want the normal life now, you know? What I used to be like, I want to be totally different to that now. I don’t like who I was, I’m not proud of what I done, so I want to be different from now on. (Charlie)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This developing sense of moral agency was also related to an altered perspective on criminality more generally, often following interactions with other individuals in the criminal justice system:<disp-quote>
<p>I was listening to people in [prison], and people were like, ‘I’m looking at seven years for having a loaded gun in the house’. Another guy was looking at 12 years. There was one guy on a murder charge. I’m looking around thinking, ‘I ain’t like that’. I don’t want to go around shooting people, why would I want to shoot someone for? Why would I want a loaded gun in the house? And people who are talking about robbing a post office, and that ain’t me. There was part of me that was thinking, ‘I shouldn’t even be here, this place is for people who do big crimes’. (John)</p>
<p>I just started thinking, it’s not worth coming in and out of [prison] all your life. It’s just a one-way street if you carry on like that. (Leroy)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, a new sense of moral agency was present in early desistance narratives, and this would appear to corroborate alternative future identities that the individual would wish to adopt. In this sense, individuals may envisage an alternative identity (which could be premised upon undertaking new social roles such as being a ‘good parent’, for example), and that the initial movement towards this new identity is sustained by a newly acquired sense of moral agency, which allows the individual to distinguish between past, present and future identities. Clearly, the desistance process is characterized in terms of the maintenance of non-offending behaviour, and this understanding formed part of the participants’ early desistance narratives, particularly in relation to their perceptions of how they would be able to maintain their early desistance in the longer term.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1462474513477790"><title>Maintenance</title>
<p>The early desistance narratives also included an indication as to how individuals sought to be able to sustain or maintain the changes that they wanted to make in their lives. This consistently included some reference to changes to social and personal contexts, and that the individual would be reliant upon such changes in order for desistance to take place. Frequently the changes required involved obtaining employment. For some participants, this was based upon prior experiences of periods of non-offending behaviour, accompanied by periods of employment:<disp-quote>
<p>I wouldn’t get into no trouble then [if I had a job]. I wouldn’t get into no trouble. Like when I was working in them two years I didn’t get into no trouble at all. When I work I work, I graft my arse off. (Charlie)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Interestingly, some participants’ accounts suggested that obtaining employment would be an ideal opportunity to display to others that they were making positive changes in their lives. Thus, employment could offer both material/economic benefits and a symbolic expression of successful desistance:<disp-quote>
<p>If I can get a job then I can start getting back on my feet. Erm, like I said, I’m only on the social so I ain’t earning much, so it’d help me out no end there. But also, it’d help me to look after my kids, and if I can get a job and hold it down it’s all going towards showing people that I’ve changed and that I want to become a better person. (Ken)</p>
<p>Well, as long as I can get work up here, a proper job I mean, and keep working then I should be ok cos it’d keep me busy, I’d be making money and everyone’d be happy. (Martin)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In some cases the importance of gaining employment could not be underestimated. It was regarded as being an essential aspect of any subsequent processes associated with desistance:<disp-quote>
<p>If I can’t get a job then I’m, basically, I’m screwed. Cos what else can I do for money. Forget about buying drugs, how am I going to buy a bloody cup of tea? I need a job, cos that’s what you do ain’t it? You get a job and everything else follows that. (Kurt)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For others, establishing new relationships was regarded as being influential in terms of sustained desistance in the future. In this regard, some of the early desistance narratives suggested that individuals recognized the important influence that others could have upon their lives:<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah, I’d like to meet someone, a nice bird, someone I could maybe settle down with. I see some of my mates and they’ve got wives, girlfriends, kids and whatever else, and they’re doing all right now. Maybe something like that’s what I need, give me a push. Get me moving in the right direction, instead of messing about and that. (Kurt)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>By contrast, other narratives suggested that participants wanted to become less reliant upon other people. This could be regarded as the individual wanting to show others that they are capable of making positive changes in their lives, and in doing so demonstrate a greater degree of personal autonomy:<disp-quote>
<p>I’m second on the list for a council flat, so that’s great. So I just want to sort my head out, and get some responsibility. I am sick of counting on other people to help me out all the while. So I want to start helping myself out. (Charlie)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The evidence presented from the early desistance narratives so far indicates that individuals were aware of the personal and social changes that were likely to facilitate their desistance from crime and, perhaps, there is a suggestion that these accounts are overly optimistic given the socio-structural contexts that many would-be desisters are likely to face. However, it is important to note that early desistance narratives were also tempered with a somewhat more realistic appraisal of the difficulties that individuals would be likely to face given their existing social and personal contexts:<disp-quote>
<p>Like I say, it ain’t the best of areas, but it’s like everyone who lives round my way is in the same position, you know? Hardly no-one’s working, there’s a lot of people up to no good, and everyone pretty much is either taking drugs or selling drugs. (John)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Such changes to social and personal contexts were clearly regarded as being necessary for the maintenance of desistance, but individuals’ narratives also incorporated an understanding of the need to have their changed attitudes and behaviour corroborated by other people.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1462474513477790"><title>Testimony of others</title>
<p>The final aspect of the early desistance narratives suggested that individuals were reliant upon the testimony, or corroboration, of others in order to sustain the newly constructed sense of self and their longer-term desistance from crime. For some individuals, the receipt of positive testimony was not regarded as something which could be achieved passively, but rather that the individual would need to demonstrate that they had made changes in order for this to be ratified by significant others. In some cases this was seen to be a possible route towards further positive changes, such as re-establishing relationships with family members:<disp-quote>
<p>I’m not allowed [to see his son] until I can prove I’ve sorted myself out. …That’s my aim, to show everyone else I’m sorted out, and then they’ll think yeah he’s changed let’s give me a chance. Unless you try it … you’re not going to sort it out for him... Everything I’m doing at the minute is geared towards that. That’s why I’m trying to get Probation behind me saying, ‘Yeah he’s done well, he’s changed’, and that, they’ll look differently at me, not just think, ‘Oh, he’s violent, he’s done this’ … They’ll think, ‘He’s changed it’. (Martin)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In other cases, individuals had already begun to experience the positive testimony of others, and this formulated part of the early desistance narrative as it confirmed for individuals that they were making positive changes and that this could be continued:<disp-quote>
<p>[The probation officer] makes you look at life how it should be, like when you go out and get drunk. And you do things, and you look back and you think, what a dickhead. You’re above a cloud and you think you’re untouchable. …After that I thought, yeah, there is life out there without getting pissed up every week, and driving cars without licences. I don’t live like that anymore, and I won’t go back. And she sees the changes that I’ve tried to make and she says, ‘yeah, you’ve done well, keep it up’ sort of thing. (Josh)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It should be acknowledged that such accounts of the importance of probation might be expected, given that the sample was recruited by supervising officers. That said, the positive testimony of others can be seen in these early desistance narratives as concretizing the initial, tentative moves towards desistance, and that this could provide the individual with the confidence and self-assurance to maintain their non-offending. However, in some cases individuals were aware that such positive testimony would be less likely – at least in the initial stages of desistance – given the preponderance to regard offenders as being ‘at risk’ until proven otherwise. This had the effect in some cases of leading individuals towards regarding particular courses of action as futile:<disp-quote>
<p>You’ve got a lot of jobs around, quite a few that ask for CRB checks, which I wouldn’t apply for anyway because I’ve got a criminal record, they’ll see I’ve got a criminal record – I don’t know whether it’d be worth applying to be honest... But I tend to have the mindset that if they’re asking for a CRB check they’re not going to employ people with a criminal record, so that’s limiting your options straight away. (Ben)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This highlights the importance of positive reactions to individuals in the early stages of desistance, as a perception of negative reactions could deter some would-be desisters from engaging with activities or life-course events which could facilitate longer-term desistance. Throughout the interview data positive testimonies from partners, close family and probation officers were regarded as being important to the individual’s desistance journey. For many of the men, securing the positive testimony of wives and girlfriends seemed to be an objective in its own right, what might be viewed as an ‘I’m doing it for them’ mentality. Not only did these men want to change and show their partners that they had changed, but they also sought ratification from their partners, perhaps to somehow secure the status of their change. Some men also regarded their probation officers in this way, which is similar in some respects to findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1462474513477790">Rex (1999)</xref>. However, it was more common for men to regard the positive testimony of their probation officer as a means to an end – in other words, the testimony of their supervising officer would enable them to achieve an alternative goal.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1462474513477790" sec-type="discussion|conclusion"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>It is not possible to tell whether the sample of participants were truly desisters. None self-reported any offending, but it is acknowledged that this is an inaccurate measure of desistance, and future research of this nature should employ more astute indicators of desistance and offending (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474513477790">Bottoms and Shapland, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1462474513477790">Shapland and Bottoms, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, it could be argued that individuals’ aspirations to change are not illustrative of the early stages of desistance, as motivation and willingness to change are not guarantees that desistance will occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1462474513477790">Burnett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1462474513477790">Farrall, 2002</xref>). However, there are several indicators that this sample of participants were in the early stages of desistance, and there are areas of significant correspondence between the early desistance narratives of the men in this sample, and the retrospective narratives found in previous studies. The argument presented thus far in this article contends that individuals who are experiencing the early stages of desistance amend existing, or construct new, narratives which may allow the individual to sustain their non-offending behaviour. This narrative change is described here as being an ‘early desistance narrative’. Within this early desistance narrative individuals begin to consider the possibility of adopting a new future identity which would allow them to distance their present and future self from their past selves, which, it is argued here, would cement the transition towards a more sustained period of non-offending. The evidence presented, therefore, may appear to suggest that a strongly subjective model is being proffered, wherein ‘one need only decide to change and envision a new identity for oneself in order to go straight’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1462474513477790">LeBel et al., 2008</xref>: 138). However, this is not the intention of this article. Rather, the argument outlined here contends that would-be desisters begin to construct an early desistance narrative which involves the identification and envisioning of an alternative identity, and that this is accompanied by an alteration to the individual’s sense of moral agency. This is facilitated by an understanding of past events as being conditioned, in part at least, by a sense of powerlessness or a lack of autonomy of these events. Individuals demonstrated awareness that, in order to maintain desistance, changes to personal and social contexts would be necessary.</p>
<p>The dilemma here is that the powerlessness suggested as being responsible for past actions was articulated as being a consequence of a social context characterized by disadvantage. In this regard, maintaining desistance is likely to be problematic for many individuals as they are likely to continue to experience such contexts of disadvantage and exclusion, and these are likely to limit the possibilities for the maintenance of desistance. As such, maintaining the early desistance narrative is also likely to be challenging. This is where existing conceptualizations of primary and secondary desistance become problematic. The manner in which the concept of primary desistance has been constructed in the past is to suggest that such narrative and identity changes do not take place until the later period of secondary desistance. Rather, primary desistance is identified simply as the temporary absence of offending behaviour. However, it is argued here that this is an inaccurate representation and, instead, that would-be desisters are likely to begin the process of narrative and identity reconstruction at a much earlier stage than has previously been suggested. Indeed, it could be argued here that there is no qualitative distinction between primary and secondary desistance, but rather that the early stages of desistance might be tempered with a degree of trepidation on the part of the would-be desister until their efforts result in a more continuous state of non-offending (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474513477790">Bottoms and Shapland, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1462474513477790">Shapland and Bottoms, 2011</xref>). This may entail periods of intermittent offending, as attempts to desist which involve a commitment to change are for whatever reason not realized (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1462474513477790">Carlsson, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of these findings from a practical point of view is that the early facilitation of such identity reconstructions could increase the likelihood of successful desistance taking place. Indeed, one means of securing the continued maintenance of the early desistance narrative, and therefore leading towards longer-term desistance, could reside in the testimony offered by others that the individual is desisting successfully. It has been argued previously that such testimony can be an important aspect of the desistance process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474513477790">Maruna, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1462474513477790">Maruna et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1462474513477790">Vaughan, 2007</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1462474513477790">Maruna et al. (2004b)</xref> argue that the process of ‘delabeling’ may be a crucial factor in helping individuals to make the transition from primary to secondary desistance. Some of the individuals in this study demonstrated that they would need actively to acquire such positive testimony by demonstrating to significant others that they had made changes in their lives – part of the process of ‘earned redemption’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1462474513477790">Bazemore, 1998</xref>: 768; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1462474513477790">Maruna et al., 2004b</xref>).</p>
<p>However, this article argues that individuals incorporate this as part of the early desistance narrative, and, therefore, that this can be built upon in a criminal justice context. The acknowledgement, by practitioners, of offending narratives may act as a foundation for some individuals to begin the process of individual change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1462474513477790">Day et al., 2006</xref>), yet it can be argued here that a similar acknowledgement of early desistance narratives may also act as an important precursor for continued desistance from crime. Greater involvement in the early narrative-building process may engender the forms of co-operation and ‘inter-personal trustworthiness’ that may be more likely to lead to longer-term desistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1462474513477790">Serin and Lloyd, 2009</xref>: 353). Future research should examine in greater detail the impact that practitioners can have upon the narrative-building process, and the implications of this for more sustained desistance. Research should also explore whether there are any similarities or differences in the early desistance narratives among offenders with alternative criminal histories. Individuals who have been more persistent or prolific offenders in the past may approach the early stages of desistance differently to those whose offending history has been less persistent.</p>
<p>A greater understanding of the early narratives of desistance, and the methods by which transitions to longer-term desistance may be facilitated, could provide an insight into how criminal justice interventions can build upon these narratives in order to secure a longer-term transition away from crime. This article supports the view that individuals are ‘active agents’ in the process of building desistance narratives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1462474513477790">Maruna et al., 2004b</xref>), but it is suggested here that earlier co-operation in narrative building, and a greater propensity – not just on behalf of criminal justice agencies – to recognize early positive changes may enhance the possibility of more individuals successfully making the transition towards long-term desistance.</p>
