<abstract>
<p>In order to elucidate the effects of carbon nanotube surface modification and carbon nanotube distribution on mechanical properties of the buckypaper composites, two oxidation processes were developed to prepare functionalized buckypapers. The tube geometries, the entanglement, and stacking state of the carbon nanotubes were characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, and atom force microscopy. Surface morphology and volume density of the buckypapers indicate that denser and homogeneous carbon nanotube skeletons are achieved by acidification on carbon nanotube powders, while only slight change can be observed from the oxidized buckypaper. The contact angles suggest that both oxidation and carbon nanotube distribution can affect the wettability of buckypapers with epoxy at 120°C, in which homogeneous and dense carbon nanotube skeleton exhibits relatively low wettability. The tensile moduli and strengths of the functionalized buckypaper composites are increased by 20–37% and 42–68%, respectively, with respect to the pristine buckypaper composite. Further analysis demonstrates that the mechanical property improvement is caused by dense carbon nanotube network and strong adhesion of oxidized carbon nanotube to the matrix. Moreover, dynamic mechanical analysis shows that the order of magnitude of storage moduli is consistent with that of the tensile Young’s moduli for different buckypaper composites.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684412468799" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, the outstanding mechanical and physical properties of individual carbon nanotube (CNT) have attracted significant efforts to develop high-performance macro-assemblies based upon CNTs, such as CNT sheet, CNT fiber, and CNT film.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412468799">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412468799">3</xref></sup> CNT sheet, also called buckypaper (BP), first introduced by Rinzler, is a self-supported CNT network with properties that are promising for fabricating high CNT content and well dispersed CNT composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412468799">4</xref></sup> Extensive studies on the preparation of BPs were conducted to demonstrate its potential applications, such as supercapacitor, sensor, hydrogen storage materials, actuators, and anode materials in lithium-ion batteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412468799">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412468799">9</xref></sup> In general, BPs are easily fabricated by vacuum filtration from well dispersed CNT solutions, in which pristine CNTs are cohesively bonded by van der Waals interactions. With respect to individual CNT, the pristine BPs (Pri-BP) showed only sub-par mechanical properties, e.g. 1–4 GPa and 6–33 MPa of the tensile modulus and strength, respectively, which will inevitably restrict their further applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412468799">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Different approaches to strengthen BPs have been theoretically and experimentally investigated with some positive results, e.g. using electron irradiation, chemical treatment, polymer intercalation, and graphitization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412468799">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412468799">14</xref></sup> Kastanis et al. reported 640% and 525% increase of the oxidized buckpaper in tensile strength and modulus, respectively, comparing with the pristine one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412468799">15</xref></sup> It has been proved that the CNT lengths can be changed by oxidation process, leading to different stacking state of CNTs in the BPs. Zhu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412468799">16</xref></sup> used a mixture of concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to obtain acid-treated CNTs, and found that the oxidized CNTs were much shorter than the pristine ones. Špitalský et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412468799">17</xref></sup> treated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with different oxidation agents and showed that the stacking density and homogeneity of the MWCNTs were improved by increasing concentration of the oxidation agents. Moreover, chemical modifications of BP are demonstrated to be feasible and effective in improving mechanical properties of the BP composites. Lopes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412468799">18</xref></sup> found that the introduction of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups onto BP increased the modulus of BP/epoxy composites by 30% and 10%, respectively; however, properties of the nanocomposites were still far below theoretically estimated values according to the rule of mixture. Owing to distinctive stacking and entangling characteristics of CNTs, resin infiltration is a critical concern to fabricate high-quality BP composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412468799">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412468799">20</xref></sup> Ashrafi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412468799">21</xref></sup> made both experimental and theoretical evaluations of the void content of BP composites, and the results showed that, by controlling the void content from 32% down to 5%, the composite tensile modulus was increased from 6.4 to 15.4 GPa.</p>
<p>In addition, the degree of CNT alignment has profound impact on the BP and the BP composite properties. Cheng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412468799">22</xref></sup> showed that, by mechanical drawing BP, which consists of randomly dispersed CNTs of high aspect ratio, about 80% CNTs could be aligned along the stretch direction. They found that the tensile strength of the BP was increased by 2.26 times and the modulus was increased up to 22 times. Moreover, tensile modulus and strength of the aligned-CNT BP composites showed 237% and 260% increase, respectively, with respect to the randomly dispersed CNT BP composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412468799">22</xref></sup> Brian et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684412468799">23</xref></sup> and Dassios et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684412468799">24</xref></sup> fabricated high-volume-fraction vertically aligned CNT composites infiltrated by epoxy resin, and the compression test indicated a 20-fold increase in Young’s modulus and 4-fold increase in the strength of the composite with respect to the as-grown MWCNT mats.</p>
<p>In order to elucidate the effects of CNT surface modification and CNT distribution on mechanical properties of the BP composites, two oxidation processes were developed to prepare functionalized BPs. The tube size, the entanglement and stacking state of CNTs were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and atom force microscopy (AFM). Three kinds of BP/epoxy composites were manufactured from BP prepregs by hot-pressing process. Wetting behavior and chemical reactions between epoxy and different BPs were characterized at high temperature according to sessile drop contact angles and exothermic thermal analysis. The tensile behavior and dynamic mechanical properties of BP composites were also conducted.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0731684412468799" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>The pristine CNTs were provided by Bayer Material Science, Germany (purity &gt;95%, outer diameter: 10–25 nm). Epoxy resin utilized in this study was a commercially available grade of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A-based epoxy with the epoxy value of 0.48–0.54, supplied by Bluestar New Chemical Materials Co. Ltd. The cure agent, 2-ethyl-4-methyl imidazole, was obtained from Tianjin Xuanang Scientific Industrial and Trading Co. Ltd. In the resin system, epoxy and cure agent were mixed at a weight ratio of 100 : 7.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0731684412468799"><title>Preparation of BPs and the composites</title>
<p>Pri-BP was prepared from aqueous CNT suspension with the aid of Triton X-100 by 2 h ultrasonication. The suspension was filtered through nylon filter with 0.45 µm diameter pores, followed by isopropyl alcohol to rinse the adsorbed surfactant. The BP samples with the size of 100  ×  200 mm<sup>2</sup> (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412468799">Figure 1(a)</xref>) were dried at 80°C for 5 h in a vacuum oven and then peeled off from the filter. Two different oxidation processes were employed to fabricate the functionalized BPs. For the first oxidation process, Pri-BPs were immersed in a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid (3 : 1 v/v) for 4 h at 40°C to prepare acid-treated BPs (denoted as acid-BP). Then, acid-BPs were treated by washing until the PH value reached 7, and dried at 80°C for 5 h. For the second oxidation process, CNT powders were first acidized in a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid (same to the first process), followed by filtrating to obtain the acid-treated CNT BP (denoted as acid-CNT-BP). The acid-CNT-BPs were washed until the pH value reached 7 and then dried at 80°C for 5 h. Note that, since the acid-treated CNTs have good dispersion, no surfactant was used to fabricate the acid-CNT-BPs. The volume density of BP was calculated via the mass divided by the volume. The length and width of BP were measured by vernier caliper, and the thickness was measured by micrometer caliper. Before manufacturing composites, BPs were first impregnated in acetone dilute resin solution to prepare BP prepregs. After the volatilization of acetone at room temperature for 10 h, the BP prepregs were obtained. Finally, five BP prepregs were stacked together, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412468799">Figure 1(b)</xref>, and the BP/epoxy composites were fabricated by hot-pressing and bleeding process at 80°C for 1 h and then 125°C for 2 h. Composites made by the Pri-BP/epoxy, acid-BP/epoxy, and acid-CNT-BP/epoxy prepregs are denoted as Pri-BPC, acid-BPC and acid-CNT-BPC, respectively, and the laminates were 150–200 µm thick.

<sec id="sec5-0731684412468799"><title>Scanning electron microscope</title>
<p>Field emission SEM was employed to analyze the CNT length, CNT stacking state in the BPs, and the composite fracture using Apollo-300 (CAMSCAN) with the acceleration voltage of 15 kV. More than 80 tubes were measured to obtain the average length according to the SEM images of dispersed CNTs. The surface pore size of Pri-BP, acid-BP, and acid-CNT-BP was estimated using Image J software. Five images were taken at different locations for each BP sample (20  ×  30 mm<sup>2</sup>). Note that the SEM image of BP surface does not contain any depth information; therefore, the BP surface roughness was measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0731684412468799"><title>Atom force microscopy</title>
<p>AFM (Dimension icon, Veeco) was utilized to estimate the surface roughness (Ra) of the BPs with a scanning region of 10  ×  10 µm<sup>2</sup>. NanoScope Analysis software was used to calculate the value of Ra, and at least 10 valid data were obtained for each.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0731684412468799"><title>Transmission electron microscope</title>
<p>The CNT diameter and their structural integrity were inspected by TEM (JEM-2100 F). The samples were prepared by depositing the CNT dispersion onto copper grids and evaporating the solvent in oven. The micrographs were taken at 200 kV, under bright ﬁeld conditions. About 60 CNT diameters were measured using Image J software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0731684412468799"><title>Contact angles test</title>
<p>Wetting properties between epoxy and BPs were characterized by quasi-static contact angles at 120°C using sessile drop method (Data physics OCA20). The liquid resin droplets of 5 µL volume were dripped onto the BP surface. Shape of the droplet was recorded, and the contour at the moment of 2 s was used to evaluate the quasi-static contact angles. At least five valid contact angles were achieved to obtain the average value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0731684412468799"><title>Differential scanning calorimeter</title>
<p>The non-isothermal tests of BP prepregs were performed with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, Mettler Toledo) at a heating rate of 10°C/min from room temperature to 200°C in nitrogen. About 5 mg samples were placed in an aluminum crucible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0731684412468799"><title>Tensile tests</title>
<p>Tensile strengths and moduli of BP composites were measured using Instron 5566 with a tensile speed of 1 mm/min at room temperature. The tensile specimens, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412468799">Figure 1(c)</xref>, were cut into rectangle shape (60  ×  6 mm<sup>2</sup>) with the gage length of 24 mm. The strain was recorded by an advanced non-contacting video extensometer of Instron 2663-821. At least six specimens were tested for each.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0731684412468799"><title>Dynamic mechanical analysis</title>
<p>The storage modulus and tan <italic>δ</italic> of BP composites were investigated using a Bohlin Instrument DMA IV dynamic mechanical analyzer. The measurements were carried out on rectangular shaped samples (25  ×  3 mm<sup>2</sup>) in tensile mode at a frequency of 1 Hz, and the temperature was raised from 25 to 250°C with the rate of 5°C/min.</p>

<p>Typical surface images of the BPs are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412468799">Figure 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412468799">Figure 2(a)</xref> indicates inhomogeneous distribution of CNTs with loose inter-entanglements in Pri-BP. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412468799">Figure 2(b)</xref>, acid-BP presents similar distribution state of CNTs with that in the precursor (i.e. Pri-BP). By contrast, acid-CNT-BP reveals relatively smooth surface with homogeneous and dense stacking of CNTs as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412468799">Figure 2(c)</xref>. Moreover, volume densities of Pri-BP, acid-BP, and acid-CNT-BP were 0.35, 0.36, and 0.53 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively, as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412468799">Table 1</xref>. According to surface images of the BPs, the apparent pore sizes were evaluated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412468799">Table 1</xref> reveals that the surface pores of acid-BP are slightly smaller than those of Pri-BP, consistent with the trend of the volume densities. The denser CNT skeleton of acid-BP should be associated with the acid treatment generating a certain degree of contraction of the BP during drying process. By comparison, the surface pores of acid-CNT-BP were smallest. Meanwhile, AFM analysis showed that values of the surface roughness of Pri-BP, acid-BP and acid-CNT-BP were 149  ±  33, 138  ±  38, and 94  ±  11 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412468799">Table 1</xref>). Thus, all these results demonstrate that the CNT skeletons of acid-CNT-BP are the most homogeneous and densest in all BPs.

<p>Further analysis of the CNT geometries was conducted for various BPs. Data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412468799">Table 1</xref> showed that the mean length of pristine CNTs was 3.68 µm. After oxidation treatment on Pri-BP, the CNT length was changed to 3.35 µm for acid-BP. For acid-CNT-BP, the CNTs were severely shortened to 1.96 µm by acidification and ultrasonic treatment. TEM characterization showed that the average outer diameter of the pristine CNTs was 17.7 nm, whereas the diameters of acid-BP and acid-CNT-BP CNTs decreased to 12.4 and 12.1 nm, respectively. These CNT geometries demonstrate that oxidation can significantly decrease the tube diameter, but slightly decrease the tube length, in accordance to the acid-BP tubes versus the Pri-BP ones. In addition, during the ultrasonication, the nanotubes were severely broken for acid-CNT-BP, but those in acid-BP were only slightly shortened due to its self-supported network.</p>
<p>The above results indicate that thinner and shorter CNTs tend to produce homogeneous distribution and dense stacking CNT networks, which is consistent with previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684412468799">25</xref></sup> It is also proved that the geometry of BP relies on the interactions of inter-tubes and tube-solvent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684412468799">26</xref></sup> X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggested that the oxidized CNTs contained 8.1% oxygen for acid-BP, 7.3% oxygen for acid-CNT-BP; however, no oxygen element could be detected from the pristine CNTs (not shown). Functional groups on the surface of the oxidized CNTs can decrease the inter-tube van der Waals interactions and improve the compatibility between the tubes with the aqueous solution. In this study, by contrast with the CNT network of Pri-BP and acid-BP, acid-CNT-BP exhibits evenly distributed CNTs with high stacking density. Hence, acid treatment on CNT powders followed by filtration of the CNT suspension is more suitable for preparing uniform and dense functionalized BPs, rather than acid treatment on pristine CNT network, namely, fabrication of acid-BP.</p>
<p>Wetting properties of the BPs were characterized by means of quasi-static contact angle measurements which were performed at the composite’s manufacturing temperature, 120°C. As observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412468799">Figure 3</xref>, the contact angle for Pri-BP is 36°, while it decreases to 34° for acid-BP. Since the CNT distributions are similar in Pri-BP and acid-BP, we can infer that better wetting property is mainly attributed to the increase of chemical functional groups of acid-BP generated by acid oxidation. This is consistent with the trend of oxygen atomic contents of CNTs for acid-BP versus Pri-BP. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412468799">Figure 3</xref>, the contact angle for acid-CNT-BP is 38°, larger than that for Pri-BP and acid-BP. The oxygen atomic contents of the CNTs suggest lower chemical reactivity of acid-CNT-BP than acid-BP. Moreover, the surface roughness of acid-CNT-BP is much smaller than that of acid-BP. Hence, comparing with acid-BP, the lower wettability of acid-CNT-BP with epoxy should be ascribed to its much smoother BP surface, denser stacking and slightly lower oxidation degree of CNTs, which are unfavorable factors. Previous studies showed that the permeability along BP thickness direction was about six orders of magnitude lower than that of general glass fiber reinforcements with volume fraction of 60%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412468799">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684412468799">27</xref></sup> Due to the resin’s extremely low capability of infiltrating through the thickness of highly stacked CNT networks, obtaining defect-free BP composites appears a great challenge.

<p>Chemical reactions between epoxy and CNTs were tested by non-isothermal DSC dynamic scan of various BP prepregs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412468799">Figure 4</xref>, the peak temperatures of the BP prepregs are all higher than that of the neat resin. The peak temperatures decrease in the sequence of acid-CNT-BP/epoxy, acid-BP/epoxy, and Pri-BP/epoxy, which is consistent with the order of the various BP densities. The total heats of cure reaction (Δ<italic>H</italic>) were calculated by dividing the resin mass in the BP prepregs to exclude the influence of CNT content. The values of Δ<italic>H</italic> for Pri-BP/epoxy, acid-BP/epoxy, and acid-CNT-BP/epoxy prepregs are respectively 395, 407, and 413 J/g, which are all less than Δ<italic>H</italic> of the epoxy resin (424 J/g). This indicates that the CNT network may retard the curing reactions of the resin due to steric hindrance, which can result in lower crosslink density in the BP composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684412468799">28</xref></sup> Moreover, the values of Δ<italic>H</italic> for the functionalized BP prepregs (i.e. acid-BP/epoxy and acid-CNT-BP/epoxy) are higher than that of Pri-BP/epoxy prepreg, which could be associated with reactions between carboxyl groups of functionalized CNTs with epoxy. Previous studies demonstrated that –COOH on the CNT surface can exert a catalytic effect for epoxide ring opening, and then react with the epoxide hydroxyl group generating ether link between COOH-CNT and epoxy matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684412468799">29</xref></sup> Therefore, according to the releasing heats, we can infer that the matrix of acid-CNT-BPC and acid-BPC could have higher curing reaction degrees than that of Pri-BPC.

<sec id="sec14-0731684412468799"><title>Tensile behavior of the BP/epoxy composites</title>
<p>BP composites were prepared by hot-pressing process, and the CNT loadings were tested to be 37.1, 36.7, and 35.6 wt%, respectively for the Pri-BPC, acid-BPC, and acid-CNT-BPC. Typical tensile stress–strain curves of the composites are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412468799">Figure 5(a)</xref>. In order to compare the tensile properties of various BP composites, the CNT loadings are normalized to 36 wt% according to the rule of mixtures. The corresponding average data of the Young’s moduli and tensile strengths are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412468799">Figures 5(b) and (c)</xref>. Tensile properties of the resin matrix were also tested in the same specimen size as the BP composite. It reveals that the tensile properties of all BP composites are much higher than those of the matrix. For instance, modulus of Pri-BPC is increased by 114% with respect to the matrix, indicating that remarkable improvement of Young’s modulus can be achieved by adding CNT networks into the epoxy. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412468799">Figure 6(a)</xref>, fracture morphology of Pri-BPC presents many void defects, implying partial impregnation of epoxy in the CNT clusters due to the inhomogeneous CNT skeletons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412468799">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The obvious defects in Pri-BPC can cause stress concentration during stretching process, thereby decrease the composite’s breaking load.

<p>As regards properties of the functionalized BP composites, acid-BPC exhibits higher modulus and strength (i.e. 5.25 GPa and 97.0 MPa, respectively) than Pri-BPC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412468799">Figure 5</xref>, with increase of 42% for the tensile strength, but only 20% for the modulus. Comparing with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412468799">Figure 6(a)</xref>, the acid-BPC fracture shows that the tubes are tightly embedded in the matrix, with short and less CNT pull-out. It suggests enhancement of the interfacial adhesion of the oxidized CNTs to the matrix, due to acid treatment on the Pri-BP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731684412468799">30</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412468799">Figure 6(b)</xref> also reveals fewer defects in acid-BPC, which agrees well with the good wetting property of acid-BP. Since oxidation on Pri-BP induces little change in the CNT network of acid-BP, particularly for non-uniform distribution of CNTs, only slight improvement was observed from the Young’s moduli of acid-BPC versus Pri-BPC.</p>
<p>According to the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412468799">Figure 5</xref>, the tensile modulus and strength of acid-CNT-BPC are, respectively, 15% and 19% higher than those of acid-BPC. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412468799">Figure 6(c)</xref> shows that CNTs in acid-CNT-BPC are distributed more closely and homogeneously than those in acid-BPC. As listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412468799">Table 1</xref>, the acid-CNT-BP tubes are averagely 1.96 µm long, much shorter than those acid-BP tubes (3.35 µm), and the tube diameters of the two BPs are close. Moreover, the surface roughness and the volume densities of the BPs demonstrate more homogeneous and denser CNT stacking state of acid-CNT-BP than acid-BP. Taking consideration of the chemical reactivity of the two BP CNTs, we can infer that uniform CNT dispersion is of vital importance to improve the mechanical properties of the resulting nanocomposites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731684412468799">31</xref></sup> In that sense, the process of oxidation on CNT powders is preferred to fabricate functionalized BP.</p>
<p>After careful observation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412468799">Figure 6(a)</xref>, lots of long CNT ends have been pulled out from the resin matrix in Pri-BPC, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412468799">Figure 6(b)</xref> shows relatively less and shorter CNT ends in acid-BPC. Furthermore, most CNTs in acid-CNT-BPC break with minimal CNT ends pulled out from the matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412468799">Figure 6(c)</xref>. These observations demonstrate that acid treatment can significantly enhance the interface adhesions between CNTs and epoxy by means of chemical reactions, which will necessarily lead to improvement in the mechanical properties of acid-CNT-BPC and acid-BPC versus Pri-BPC.</p>
<p>In this study, the volume density of acid-CNT-BP is 0.53 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, approximately 1.5 times as the density of Pri-BP and acid-BP. Our experimental test showed that the CNT content of acid-CNT-BPC continued to decrease with increasing BP layers, e.g. the contents were 35.6, 31.7 and 29.5 wt%, respectively, for the composites containing 5, 8, and 10 BP layers, indicating of resin-rich in the composite. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412468799">Figure 7</xref>, resin-rich regions are revealed between the BP layers of acid-CNT-BPC, which should be attributed to low wettability and low permeability of epoxy in acid-CNT-BP due to the high-density stacking CNT network. The inter-layer resin-rich area is relatively weaker than the BP layer. Therefore, during the stretching process of anisotropic acid-CNT-BPC, microcracks tended to first occur, caused by shear failure around the interface between the resin-rich layer and the BP layer, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412468799">Figure 7(c)</xref>. These microcracks could easily progress into macroscopic cracks along the inter-BP zone, and finally initiated overall failure of the composite. These resin-rich defects inevitably restrict the property enhancement of functionalized BP composites. Hence, appropriate processing is vital to manufacture defect-free composite so as to extract the potential performance of the BPs, particularly for those with dense stacking CNT skeletons.

<p>The viscoelastic properties of the BP composites were measured by DMA. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412468799">Figure 8(a)</xref>, the storage moduli of Pri-BPC, acid-BPC, and acid-CNT-BPC are dramatically increased, by 98%, 148%, and 183%, respectively, comparing with that of the neat matrix at ambient temperature. This order of magnitude of the storage moduli agrees well with the tensile moduli for various BP composites. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412468799">Figure 8(a)</xref>, all the storage moduli show steady decrease with higher temperature. At temperatures higher than glass transitions, the rubbery BP composites display higher storage modulus than the neat resin matrix, but only slight difference can be seen between the three BP composites.

<p>The glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>) was evaluated according to the peak of the tan <italic>δ</italic> profile, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412468799">Figure 8(b)</xref>.

This indicates that the CNT skeletons can restrict the motion capability of polymer chain segments due to nanoscale stacking texture and extremely large aspect ratio of the tubes. This is in agreement with the less heat of reactions of BP prepregs according to the thermoanalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412468799">Figure 4</xref>). For the neat matrix, without steric effect of CNTs, the polymer chain segments can achieve motion capability at a relatively lower temperature. Additionally, broad and twin peaks are revealed by the tan <italic>δ</italic> profiles of acid-BPC and acid-CNT-BPC, both exhibiting an additional small peak at higher temperature close to the elastomeric state.</p>

<p>Two acid oxidation processes were employed to fabricate functionalized BPs. One process was acid treatment on the Pri-BP to prepare acid-BP. For the other process, acid treatment was conducted on pristine CNT powders and then fabricated acid-CNT-BP. Surface morphology and volume density of the BPs indicate that the CNT stacking is slightly denser in acid-BP than in the precursor Pri-BP, with no significant change in the overall CNT distribution. By contrast, acid-CNT-BP is much denser with more homogeneous CNT network than Pri-BP and acid-BP. The CNT geometries of the BPs demonstrate that, in general, oxidation and ultrasonication can significantly decrease the tube diameter and the length, respectively. However, for the self-supported CNT networks, the tubes were only slightly broken by ultrasonic treatment. The contact angle analysis suggests that acid-BP is easier wetted by epoxy than Pri-BP, due to oxidation. Interestingly, acid-CNT-BP with the dense and oxidized CNT skeleton, exhibits the lowest wettability with epoxy. Comparing with Pri-BPC, the tensile moduli of acid-BPC and acid-CNT-BPC are increased by 20% and 37%, and the tensile strengths are increased by 42% and 68%, respectively. Further analysis demonstrates that the higher mechanical properties of the functionalized BP composites are mainly attributed to dense CNT stacking and stronger adhesion of the oxidized CNT to the matrix. The resin-rich defects inevitably restrict the mechanical property enhancement of functionalized BP composites. Additionally, the dynamic mechanical analysis suggests that the order of magnitude of the storage moduli for Pri-BPC, acid-BPC, and acid-CNT-BPC meshes well with the result from tensile test.</p>
