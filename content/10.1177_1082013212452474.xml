<abstract>
<p>Edible films composed of high-amylose corn starch and chitosan were developed by casting method. The effects of the ratio of high-amylose corn starch to chitosan, concentration of glycerol and methyl cellulose on the oxygen and carbon dioxide permeation, water vapor transmission, tensile strength and percent elongation at break values of edible composite films were investigated. Film microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the increase of the ratio of chitosan and content of glycerol in the film forming suspensions both made the structure of films flexible, causing the decrease of tensile strength and increase of percent elongation of composite films, while showing poor water vapor barrier properties as the water vapor transmission values increased. The addition of methyl cellulose as to reinforce the structure of matrix improved the water vapor barrier properties of the edible films with the decrease of water vapor transmission from 1946 to 1668 g/(m<sup>2</sup>·24 h), as well as the mechanical properties were improved as expected, which could be attributed to the differentia of the interaction between methyl cellulose and other components in the film preparation as the concentration ranged from 2% (w/w) to 8% (w/w). Films with different compositions, resulting different microstructures, showed variance in barrier and mechanical properties.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013212452474" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Along with the growth of environmental concerns over chemically synthesized plastics, there has been an increasing interest in biodegradable films made from renewable and natural polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013212452474">Mali et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013212452474">Mathew and Abraham, 2008</xref>). Water-soluble polysaccharides such as starch, chitosan, cellulose derivatives and so on can form biodegradable and edible films, which do have the potential to replace the conventional packaging in some applications.</p>
<p>Starch is an attractive raw material for edible packaging because of its low cost, abundant resource, renewability and biodegradability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013212452474">Alves et al., 2007</xref>). High-amylose starch is a preferable film-forming material because of its strong gelation properties and helical linear polymer structure compared with normal starches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013212452474">Bader and Göritz, 1994</xref>). Films made of high-amylose corn starch (HACS) showed excellent oxygen barrier properties and most stable mechanical properties at high relative humidities when compared with those made of normal starches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013212452474">Lawton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013212452474">Rindlav-Westling et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013212452474">Stading et al., 2001</xref>). Nevertheless, starch-based films exhibit several other disadvantages such as poor water vapor barrier and water solubility, which restrict its application for food packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013212452474">Banker, 1966</xref>). One approach to mitigate these shortcomings is to blend starch with other biodegradable relatively hydrophilic polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013212452474">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Even though, as with synthetic polymers, the mechanical and barrier properties of composite biofilms strongly depend on the constituting polymer characteristics and their compatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013212452474">Butler et al., 1996</xref>). Controlling film formulation allows to tailor the mechanical and barrier properties of these materials, improving the efficiency of packaged foods conservation.</p>
<p>Chitosan is a high molecular weight polymer formed by deacetylation of chitin, which is the second most abundant biopolymer in nature after cellulose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013212452474">Wong et al., 1992</xref>). Compared with other polysaccharides, chitosan (CH) is a good choice for film forming material as a linear polyelectrolyte at acidic pH with several important advantages, including antifungal property, biocompatibility, biodegradability and no toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212452474">Chillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013212452474">García et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013212452474">Nunthanid et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013212452474">Wiles et al., 2000</xref>). Starch and CH both have been reported as potential materials for food packaging, especially as edible films and coatings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013212452474">García et al., 2001</xref>). However, the use of a mixture of chitosan and corn starch to obtain biodegradable films has not been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013212452474">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013212452474">Zhai et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to get the premium performance, the properties of composite films can be modified by the addition of various chemicals in minor amounts. For example, plasticizers, such as glycerol and sorbital, are often used to modify the mechanical properties of the films. The addition of plasticizers overcomes starch film brittleness and improves flexibility and extensibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212452474">Cuq et al., 1997</xref>). Methyl cellulose is a cellulose derivative composed of linear chains of β(1–4) glucosidic units with methyl, exhibiting thermo-gelation and having excellent film-making properties and efficient oxygen barrier properties. In preparation of composite edible films, the reasonable addition of methyl cellulose (MC) increases the apparent viscosities of the filmogenic suspensions while decreasing the flexibility, resulting homogeneous films with high mechanical strength.</p>
<p>Concerning edible films, numerous studies have been carried out to evaluate the mechanical and barrier properties of the films formed by starch or chitosan, with the main target to find the proper balance between good barrier properties and mechanical performances. However, no specific studies about the properties of HACS and CH laminated films incorporation of glycerol and MC at different film compositions have been reported. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of CH, glycerol and MC contents on the microstructure and the performance of HACS–CH edible films, which is a subject of great importance as it provides the knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of the possible applications of composed films in the future of food shelf life.</p>

<p>HACS with 55% amylose was provided by National Starch, Co., USA. Chitosan with a minimum deacetylation degree of 90% was purchased from Boao Biotech, Co. (Shanghai, China). Methylcellulose and glycerol were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, Co. (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were of analytical or better grade.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1082013212452474"><title>Films preparation</title>
<p>Chitosan solutions (1%, w/v) were prepared by dispersing 10 g of chitosan in 1000 ml of acetic acid solution (1%, v/v). Starch solutions (2%, w/v) were prepared by dispersing 10 g of HACS in distilled water with the addition of glycerol and MC. A series of HACS/CH blends were processed into films by casting method through varying the ratio of HACS to CH, the concentration of glycerol and MC, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013212452474">Table 1</xref>. The mixture was heated to 90 °C in a thermal bath (Jiangsu, China) under constant stirring for 20 min, followed by a filtration to eliminate insoluble matter. The film-forming solution was degassed under vacuum value of 0.09–0.1 MPa to remove dissolved air and then poured on acrylic moulds (17 × 17 mm). After drying in an oven (50 °C) for 48 h, the films were cooled to ambient temperature before peeled off from the plates. Dried films were conditioned at 50% relative humidity and 25 °C prior to testing.

<p>Scanning electron micrographs of surfaces of films formulated with different components are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212452474">Figure 1</xref>. All films showed smooth surfaces with no pores or cracks. HACS film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212452474">Figure 1(a)</xref>) showed the most homogeneous and smoothest surface, indicating the brittleness and rigidity of the film. However, adding 50% CH into the suspension made the film surface become less homogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212452474">Figure 1(b)</xref>). It indicated that addition of CH disrupted the inter-molecular hydrogen bonds of the adjacent starch chains and newly formed hydrogen bonds between NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> groups of CH and hydroxyl groups of HACS, which were much weaker than that formed between HACS molecular chains, resulting in less integrated and more flexible structure of composite films. With the incorporation of 6% (w/w) MC, HACS–CH composite films showed a relatively smooth and continuous surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212452474">Figure 1(c)</xref>), due to the cross-linking in the matrix caused by MC molecules.

<p>Cross sections of composite films were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212452474">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013212452474">3</xref>. Multilayer structures were detected as seen by SEM. This could attribute to the limited matrix compatibility and chain mobility of those film-forming components. Even though the flexibility of composite films can be modified under the action of CH and HACS, the compatibility of them was declined when a suitable composition ratio was reached. That can well explain the differences among the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212452474">Figure 2</xref>. Composite films with HACS: CH 2:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212452474">Figure 2(a)</xref>) and 1:2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212452474">Figure 2(c)</xref>), both showed multilaminar structure with fine pores and cracks, while that with the proportion of 1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212452474">Figure 2(b)</xref>) showed a relatively homogeneous and compact structure. Effect of the concentration of MC varied likewise. It can be seen that, after the appropriate content of 6% (w/w) MC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013212452474">Figure 3(b)</xref>) was reached, further addition of MC to the level of 8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013212452474">Figure 3(c)</xref>) caused the distinct phase separation and irregular structure of the composite film.

<p>Therefore, the composition of film-forming suspensions is essential for the performance of product films as they remarkably affect the compatibility of the film matrix, then cause microstructure variance and furthermore determine the properties and application of HACS–CH composite films.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1082013212452474"><title>Gas permeability</title>
<p>Permeability of O<sub>2</sub> (PO<sub>2</sub>) and CO<sub>2</sub> (PCO<sub>2</sub>) determines the composition of the atmosphere around the food products, which is the key point of the application of edible films in food conservation. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013212452474">Table 1</xref>, both PO<sub>2</sub> and PCO<sub>2</sub> increased when the ratio of HACS to CH varied from 2:1 to 1:2, while decreased when the ratio varied from 1:2 to 0:1. Attributed to the flexible structure of the composite films caused by the addition of CH, gas transferred more easily in the HACS–CH composite films than in the pure HACS films (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212452474">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, it resulted in the significant increase of PO<sub>2</sub> (18.15 times) and PCO<sub>2</sub> (4.43 times) when the proportion ranged from 2:1 to 1:2.

<p>Regarding that the gas permeability of films is a synthetic process of solution, diffusion and transmission in the film matrix formed by composite polymers, the observed changes in gas permeabilities of the films with different compositions may differ evidently. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013212452474">Forssell et al. (2002)</xref> found that amylose films plasticized with glycerol have good oxygen barrier when glycerol content was up to 30%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013212452474">Gontard et al. (1996)</xref> studied the influence of relative humidity and film composition on oxygen and carbon dioxide permeabilities of edible films. It was shown that PO<sub>2</sub> and PCO<sub>2</sub> of wheat gluten films varied greatly with water content; moreover, the water activity of the food and the relative humidity of the surrounding atmosphere may affect the concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the film matrix, when several hydrophilic compounds are used as food packaging or coating material.</p>
<p>The effects of glycerol and MC content on gas permeability of the composite films were examined. PO<sub>2</sub> and PCO<sub>2</sub> showed unstable correlation with variation in the glycerol content. The films possessed relatively high gas permeabilities as the glycerol concentrations ranged from 10% to 20% (w/w), whereas relatively low at lower or higher contents. It could presume that, within a certain range of glycerol concentrations, glycerol acted as plasticizer in the film-forming matrix to extend, dilute and soften the structure effectively.</p>
<p>Due to the hydrophobic character of MC, less amount of water would be absorbed in the matrix. Theoretically, the addition of MC into the matrix could reinforce the intermolecular interaction and result in an integrated structure of the product film with low gas permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013212452474">Garcia et al., 2004</xref>). While the results of this study showed that PO<sub>2</sub> and PCO<sub>2</sub> were rather higher than those with no MC, which was opposite to the expected result, it suggests that free area might be increased in the matrix.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1082013212452474"><title>Effect of CH contents</title>
<p>Water transport in edible films of starch–chitosan based products is a complex phenomenon due to the strong interaction of sorbed water molecules with polymeric structure of the film matrix. The WVT values of the composite films as a function of CH ratio in the film-forming solutions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013212452474">Figure 4(a)</xref>. WVT values increased from 1421 to 1849 g/(m<sup>2</sup>·24 h) in relation to the proportions of HACS/CH range between the ratios studied in this paper. The maximum value occurred at the ratio of 1:2 and then remained approximately constant with the further addition of CH. Pure CH film had a WVT of 1792 g/(m<sup>2</sup>·24 h), while the value was 1421 g/(m<sup>2</sup>·24 h) for the HACS film. Compared with CH films, HACS films had a more compact and dense structure as observed by SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212452474">Figure 1(a)</xref>), due to the stronger inter- and intra-molecular interactions in HACS matrix. The addition of CH, which contains many hydrophilic groups of <inline-formula id="ilm1-1082013212452474"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-1082013212452474"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>NH</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, lowered the density of HACS–CH composite films along with weakening the intensity of the interaction between these two main film-forming components. This behavior is common with the decrease of the WVT values with the addition of starch, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013212452474">Xu et al. (2005)</xref>. The reported values in this contribution are much higher than those observed in their works. Such deviation can only be explained by procedure differences on preparing films.

<sec id="sec15-1082013212452474"><title>Effect of glycerol contents</title>
<p>The effect of glycerol content on WVT is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013212452474">Figure 4(b)</xref>. The results indicated that general increase in glycerol content increased WVT values. When the concentration of glycerol increased from 0% to 25% (w/w), WVT values subsequently increased from 1523 to 1893 g/(m<sup>2</sup>·24 h) but apparently decreased to 1559 g/(m<sup>2</sup>·24 h) as glycerol concentration reached 30% (w/w). These results could be related to structural modifications of the starch network caused by the plasticizer. Micromolecule glycerol was used as plasticizing agents to increase the distance between HACS and CH molecular chains and then weaken the intermolecular interactions, resulting in the increase of molecular mobility and flexible structure of the matrix. On the other hand, glycerol has a certain level of hydrophilicity, which favors the absorption and desorption of water molecules. As a result, WVT values increased with glycerol content, which is accordant with the trend reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013212452474">Bertuzzi et al. (2007)</xref>. However, further addition of glycerol caused the enhancement of interaction between glycerol molecules rather than that with other film-forming components, and then, matrix flexibility declined when compared with that at relatively low glycerol contents, thus resulted in the decrease of WVT.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1082013212452474"><title>Effect of MC contents</title>
<p>WVT of the composite films first remained with little change with the increase of MC content to the level of 2% (w/w), then followed by a significant diminishment from 1946 g/(m<sup>2</sup>·24 h) to 1668 g/(m<sup>2</sup>·24 h) as the MC content increased from 2% to 6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013212452474">Figure 4(c)</xref>). The film containing 6% (w/w) MC has the lowest WVT value, while the level of 2% MC has the maximum value in contrast. During further increase in MC content to 8% (w/w), WVT value almost remained the same. Reduction of WVT with increasing MC content results in improvement of the functional properties of composite films, attributed to the highly crystalline and hydrophobic character of the cellulose fibers in comparison to starch polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013212452474">Nunthanid et al., 2001</xref>). The decrease of WVT by incorporation of MC is in agreement with results reported for carboxymethyl cellulose used in biocomposites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013212452474">Almasi et al., 2010</xref>). At a low content, MC probably dispersed well in the starch matrix and blocked the WVT. However, additional amounts of MC might cause the MC molecules to congregate, which decreased the effective contents of MC molecules and facilitated the water vapor permeation through the film matrix.</p>

<p>The tensile strength values of HACS–CH composite films with different proportions are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013212452474">Table 2</xref>. It was found that the tensile strength values of the films first decreased with addition of CH and then remained constant with further increase. The values of the composite films dramatically decreased from 23.21 to 3.89 MPa as the proportions ranged from 1:0 to 0:1, attributable to the formation of hydrogen bonds between <inline-formula id="ilm2-1082013212452474"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-1082013212452474"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>NH</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of the CH backbone and OH<sup>−</sup> of HACS. It also can be seen that HACS films exhibited a higher tensile strength value than CH films, indicating that the interaction between intermolecular chains in HACS is much more stronger than that in CH.

<p>The percent elongation values increased from 1.64% to 39.19%, the maximum occurring at the ratio of 1:1. However, when the ratio of CH was further increased to 1:2, the percent elongation values decreased to 26.95%. Starch films are typically very brittle, although the addition of CH facilitated the flexibility of films by lowering the crystallinity of starch; too much CH may lower the flexibility of the films to the contrary, as a result of the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds rather than intermolecular ones between HACS and CH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212452474">Figure 1(b)</xref>). In consideration of the difference in composition of film-forming blendings and the experimental method, the change trend of curve above actually showed accordance with that of chitosan membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013212452474">Liu et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec19-1082013212452474"><title>Effect of glycerol contents</title>
<p>As can be observed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013212452474">Table 2</xref>, glycerol concentration ranging from 0% to 30% caused 80.10% decrease in tensile strength values compared with the initial value. Glycerol might be intended to decrease the intermolecular forces along polymer chains and thus the rigidity of the network, producing a less ordered film structure, and increase the flexibility of polymer chain movements (Caner et al., 1998). The formation of hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups of the glycerol and HACS, or the amino, hydroxyl and amide groups of CH, may decrease the possibility of forming intra- or intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the two main components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013212452474">Banker, 1966</xref>). Consequently, tensile strength values of the composite films decreased in relation to the increase of glycerol concentration.</p>
<p>The average percent elongation values of the composite films shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013212452474">Table 2</xref>, increasing from 34.27% to 55.40%, the maximum occurring at the concentration of 20% (w/w). However, when the concentration of glycerol was increased further to 25%, the percent elongation values abruptly decreased to 32.76%. This result could be attributed to the deterioration of crystalline region, increasing the amorphous area and mobility of molecules.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1082013212452474"><title>Effect of MC contents</title>
<p>Both the values of tensile strength and percent elongation first decreased as MC content increased to 2% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013212452474">Table 2</xref>), while the values increased when the contents ranged from 2% to 4%. This could be attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of MC and HACS and the amino or amide groups of CH. With further increase of MC concentration from 4% to 6%, the tensile strength reduced significantly from 14.83 to 10.78 MPa. As MC content was more than 4%, viscosity in the film suspension would increase and homogeneity of the structure of composite films would decrease, which resulted in the decrease of percent elongation values.</p>
<p>This could be attributed to the cross-linking caused by the small quantity of MC with highly linear structure, which in turn reduced the flexibility of film matrix. At the contents between 2% and 6%, MC effectively improved mechanical properties as a modificator in film structure by increasing the hydrogen bonds formed between film-forming components. While at the concentration of more than 6%, the interaction between linear MC molecules enlarged crystalline region in film matrix, which was similar to starch retrogradation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1082013212452474" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Different film-forming compositions had remarkable influence on various properties. The flexible structure caused by the addition of, ratios ranging from 1:0 to 0:1, attributed to evident changes in both mechanical and barrier properties of composite films, as the increasing permeability of gas and water, yet the decreasing values of tensile strength and percent elongation.</p>
<p>The examined effect of glycerol showed that the addition of glycerol to the film-forming suspensions could efficiently improve the flexibility of product films as can be seen from the micrographs, which resulted in decreasing tensile strength values and increasing WVT values with the increase of glycerol contents. However, the inconstant variation of percent elongation values and gas permeabilities indicated that the usage of glycerol in the film preparation for the purpose of softening the network of matrix would be limited within a certain range.</p>
<p>Methyl cellulose used as modificator in film preparation evidently improved the mechanical properties and water transportation. Compared to no MC added films, those with 6% (w/w) MC exhibited better barrier and mechanical characterization. Continuing increase of MC content led to the heterogeneous structure of composite films, which in turn resulted in the declination of the barrier and mechanical properties.</p>
