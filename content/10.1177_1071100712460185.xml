<sec id="section1-1071100712460185">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Extra-articular dorsal closing wedge osteotomy has been used with successful results for Freiberg disease; however, there has been concern regarding the technical difficulty. The purpose of this study was to address technical tips and report on the clinical and radiographic outcome using Kirchner wire–assisted dorsal closing wedge osteotomy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712460185">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A retrospective review of 13 patients with a mean age of 29.1 years was conducted. Extra-articular dorsal wedge osteotomy was performed after debridement of the joint. Two Kirschner wires were inserted and used as a joystick to manipulate the osteotomized bone. The osteotomy site was fixed with crossed pins. Clinical outcome was assessed according to American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score, range of motion of the metatarsophalangeal joint, and visual analogue scale. Head necrosis was classified according to Smillie stage; time to bone union and metatarsal shortening were reviewed. Patients were followed for a mean period of 44.2 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712460185">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score at the latest follow-up was 92.2 (range, 92-100). The range of motion of the metatarsophalangeal joint showed a mean increase of 6.2 degrees (range, –10 to 25) at the latest follow-up. The mean visual analogue scale score decreased from 7.5 (range, 5-10) preoperatively to 1 (range, 0-4) at the latest follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). All osteotomies healed on average after 7.0 weeks (range, 4-13.6) without nonunion. The average metatarsal shortening was 0.5 mm (range, –3.1 to 3.5). None of the patients showed progression of osteonecrosis or joint space narrowing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712460185">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Extra-articular closing dorsal wedge osteotomy can yield good articular congruity with bone remodeling, with easy performance of the procedure with temporary Kirschner wires without complication.</p>

<p>Although most patients with Freiberg infraction can be treated conservatively (eg, activity modification, orthoses, or cast),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460185">6</xref></sup> failure of conservative treatment warrants operative treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460185">1</xref></sup> Several methods have been described, including resection arthroplasty, joint debridement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460185">6</xref></sup> and osteotomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460185">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460185">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460185">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460185">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460185">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460185">11</xref></sup> Though no treatment modality has become the gold standard, closing-wedge osteotomy has been widely performed with good results, even in advanced cases since Gauthier described the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460185">5</xref></sup> Two types of closing-wedge osteotomy—intra-articular and extra-articular—have been supported by a number of authors. In intra-articular osteotomy, there is less concern about transfer metatarsalgia; however, less secure fixation from a small remaining intact portion of the metatarsal head and avascular necrosis may be disadvantages. Despite concern for excessive elevation of the metatarsal head, extra-articular closing-wedge osteotomy has the advantage of more secure fixation at the normal metaphyseal osteotomy site, compared with intra-articular osteotomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460185">11</xref></sup> However, there are also arguments against the procedure, including technical difficulty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460185">3</xref></sup> We performed extra-articular dorsal wedge osteotomy using temporary Kirschner wires (K-wires) as joysticks to assist in achieving and maintaining reduction during cross-pinning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiologic results of this technique.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Between August 2006 and April 2010, 13 patients with Freiberg disease underwent metatarsal neck dorsal closing-wedge osteotomy. Operative indications included persistent pain despite conservative treatment, including cast, activity modifications, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for more than 6 months. During the study period, 15 patients underwent dorsal closing-wedge osteotomy for treatment of Freiberg disease. Among them, 13 met the criteria, with at least a 2-year follow-up based on a procedure using the K-wire-assisted technique. There were 12 female patients and 1 male patient, with a mean age of 29.1 years (range, 12-68). All patients had pain in the metatarsal head, which was aggravated when walking or bearing weight for a mean duration of 17 months (range, 3-60). None of the patients had a history of significant trauma; 1 patient had a history of minor repetitive trauma. Six patients were obese (body mass index &gt; 25). Twelve patients had a lesion in the second metatarsal head and 1 in the third. When the lesions were classified according to Smillie stage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460185">12</xref></sup> there were 3 patients in stage II, 3 in stage III, 6 in stage IV, and 1 in stage V. Before surgery, 4 radiographic views of the foot (anteroposterior, lateral, and both oblique views) were evaluated, and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the foot was performed. Other data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712460185">Table 1</xref>. The mean follow-up period was 44.2 months (range, 24.1-66).</p>

<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>Under regional or general anesthesia, the patient was in a supine position on a radiolucent table. An extra-articular dorsal wedge osteotomy at the metatarsal neck was performed using the method as described by Chao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460185">4</xref></sup> A longitudinal dorsal approach was used to expose the metatarsal head. The joint was debrided with removal of loose fragments, without removal of the lesion itself. Partial synovectomy was performed. Even in advanced cases, the healthy plantar cartilage was rotated to the center of the joint. Preoperative MRI was used to calculate the angle of the osteotomy. At the midsagittal cut of the T1 image, we measured the angle that the head would need to be rotated and the length of the metatarsal neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712460185">Figure 1</xref>). However, the amount of the rotation angle could be adjusted according to the intraoperative findings. Under fluoroscopic guidance, at the neck of the metatarsal, two 0.035-inch K-wires were inserted into the metatarsal to make the angle between the 2 K-wires the targeted angle. The K-wires were cut so that they would remain short. Along the provisionally inserted K-wires, a closing-wedge osteotomy was made using an oscillating saw, taking care not to cut the plantar cortex of the metatarsal. After removal of the wedge-shaped bone and with the K-wires as a joystick, the gap was closed to make the angle between the K-wires 0 degrees. The K-wires were held parallel with a needle holder. While reduction was maintained, cross-pinning was performed with two 0.062-inch K-wires from dorsal and distal to plantar and proximal. The provisional K-wires were then removed, and the ends of the cross-pinning K-wires were buried under the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712460185">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100712460185">3</xref>).</p>

<caption>
<p>Method to measure length to be osteotomized. We drew a right-angled triangle of which the adjacent side was the metatarsal neck tangential to the metatarsal head, and the opposite side was the length of the osteotomy, and the angle was previously measured. Using the tangent trigonometric ratio, we calculated the approximate length for the osteotomy. The hollow arrow: center of rotation. The amount of the angle to be rotated (angle a) should be the same as the angle of osteotomized bone (angle b). The asterisk, the opposite side of the triangle, is the length of the osteotomy. The adjacent side of the small triangle is the diameter of the metatarsal bone at the level of the metatarsal neck. Note that the length of the asterisk is always shorter than that of the asterisks.</p>

<title>Evaluation of Patients and Operative Parameters</title>
<p>For clinical evaluation, the lesser toe metatarsophalangeal-interphalangeal scale developed by the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society was used for objective assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460185">10</xref></sup> Range of motion of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint was also evaluated. Visual analogue scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460185">7</xref></sup> was used for assessment of pain relief or aggravation. Patients were followed, and radiographs were performed at 2 weeks and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Radiographic bone union was defined as bridging of the osteotomy by callus in 3 views. Change in configuration of the head of the metatarsal was also assessed. Postoperative metatarsal shortening was measured on anteroposterior weightbearing radiographs using a method reported by Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460185">11</xref></sup> Radiographs were reviewed by 2 independent examiners to verify bone union and change of the head.</p>

<p>Like rotational osteotomy for osteonecrosis of the femoral head, dorsal wedge osteotomy for Freiberg disease can restore articular congruity at the MTP joint by rotating the uninvolved articular portion to the center of rotation. The resultant decompression might revitalize the necrotic bone. Several authors have reported good results of dorsal wedge osteotomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460185">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460185">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460185">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460185">8</xref>,9,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460185">11</xref></sup> Both intra- and extra-articular osteotomies have been used, and pros and cons have been reported. With intra-articular osteotomy, firm fixation is technically demanding due to the small distal portion of healthy bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460185">11</xref></sup> Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460185">11</xref></sup> reported good results of intra-articular osteotomy using absorbable pins; however, the cost of absorbable pins should be considered, and healing time is relatively long, with similar duration of cast immobilization, compared to other studies. Extra-articular osteotomy can be used without these drawbacks. However, there is still technical difficulty,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460185">3</xref></sup> including inevitable soft tissue stripping, which might delay bone healing or cause further aseptic necrosis. In our study, we reproduced the targeted angle using fluoroscopic guidance, and K-wires were inserted at that angle. They were used as a guide for sawing. After removal of the wafer of bone, the osteotomy was maintained with the K-wires held by a needle holder, which made cross-pinning much easier without extensive soft tissue stripping. We achieved stable fixation with early bone healing allowing early range of motion of the MTP joint possible.</p>
<p>However, previous studies have scarcely described the amount of rotation of the metatarsal head. Lee et al described the length of the base of the wedge of bone as 5 mm in mild cases and 7 mm in advanced cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460185">11</xref></sup> In advanced cases, a smaller part of plantar cartilage remained to cover the entire portion of the articulation. We rotated the intact plantar cartilage to cover the center of rotation. The angle did not exceed 30 degrees even in advanced cases. Since the length from the center of rotation to the tangent differed between the metatarsal neck and metatarsal head, we did not have to remove too much healthy bone. We postulate that this is the reason why we did not experience excessive shortening of the metatarsal.</p>
<p>Even in cases with a small area of restored articular cartilage, we were able to achieve articular congruity with remodeling of bone, although we did not perform MRI for confirmation. Although this study included 4 patients who were 15 years or younger, and adolescent patients might tend to have a more favorable natural history. Two of these patients had the second- and third-shortest length of restoration. As with the Sugioka osteotomy for osteonecrosis of the femoral head, we speculated that a slight alteration of the biomechanics can halt progression of the disease by decompression rather than young age.</p>
<p>As several authors had experienced limitation of motion in the MTP joint, we also experienced limitation of motion. In their series, Lee et al reported no loss of joint motion and suggested that the possible cause was not to use protruding fixation materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460185">11</xref></sup> However, the rotation necessarily caused limitation of plantarflexion. In our cases, most limitations of motion occurred in plantarflexion compared to the unaffected side. However, total range of motion improved, particularly dorsiflexion, which is needed for normal toe-off. No one complained of gait disturbance with limited plantarflexion.</p>
<p>In our case series, there were several limitations. First, this is a retrospective, noncomparative study with a small sample. However, the procedure was performed prospectively using a careful regimen. Second, in spite of using MRI, the angle of correction was not accurate to more than 1 or 2 degrees. Rather, due to the thickness of oscillating saw, the rotated angle or length of the base of the wedge osteotomy could have been larger than what we had measured with the MRI.</p>
<p>In conclusion, extra-articular closing dorsal wedge yielded good articular congruity with bone remodeling with easy performance of the procedure with assistance of temporary K-wires without complication.</p>
