<p>This project employs 2008 National Election Study (NES) data to explore whether parents are different than nonparents in terms of their political attitudes and candidate evaluations. We find that parenthood does have political consequences although often not in ways suggested by conventional wisdom. Rather than finding parents to be a conservative group, our results support the idea that raising children has liberalizing effects on the attitudes of women. Fatherhood shapes attitudes less than motherhood, but these fewer effects are in a conservative direction. We argue that the distinctive politics of mothers and fathers reflects the impact of parenting as a gendered socialization experience combined with the contrasting parenthood themes articulated by the Republican and Democratic parties. Finally, despite media coverage suggesting Sarah Palin’s “Hockey Mom” image would attract parents, especially mothers, to her candidacy and the Republican ticket we find no support for this idea.</p>

<p>Mothers and fathers were given a high-profile role in the 2008 presidential campaign by the candidates, the parties, and the media. Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain turned to the language of the family to frame their contrasting proposals for the nation’s ailing economy and articulate their visions of the appropriate role of government. In keeping with recent tradition, the news media introduced new “parent-labels” including “Wal-Mart Moms” and “Mortgage Moms” as lenses through which to analyze the central issues of the 2008 presidential contest (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1532673X11400015">Kristol, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1532673X11400015">Poniewozik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1532673X11400015">Tumulty, 2008</xref>). Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s self-identification as a “Hockey Mom,” as well as her status as a working mother of five children, brought the theme of motherhood to new heights in 2008 election coverage. The McCain campaign, as well as much media commentary, suggested that Sarah Palin’s presence on the Republican ticket would attract the votes of women and mothers who could relate to her work-parenting balancing act and her strong family values (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11400015">Goldenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532673X11400015">Healy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532673X11400015">Healy &amp; Zeleny, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532673X11400015">Severson, 2008</xref>). Fathers and fatherhood were also a visible theme. Democratic candidate Barack Obama, in particular, devoted considerable space in his appeals to the idea of “Responsible Fatherhood” and the need for fathers to become more involved in the lives of their children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532673X11400015">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, we examine the objects of the parties’ appeals and the media’s catchy labels—the parents themselves. We hypothesize that parenting embodies an intense adult socialization experience with the capacity to shape political attitudes on a range of policies and that the heavy use of parenting themes during the 2008 election primed mothers and fathers to invoke their parental identities when thinking about the key issues and choices facing the nation. We employ 2008 American National Election Studies (NES) data to explore this hypothesis and examine the impact of parenthood on political attitudes and candidate evaluations. In our research we seek to answer several related questions: First, are parents any different than their peers without children in terms of their attitudes toward the appropriate role for government, national security matters, and cultural values issues? Second, did parents have particularly positive assessments of any of the 2008 presidential or vice presidential candidates, especially Sarah Palin, given the media’s emphasis on her status as a “Hockey Mom” and a mother of five children? Third, does the experience of parenthood affect the political attitudes of women and men in similar or in different ways? Finally, given that parenthood and marriage are frequently interconnected experiences, how does the impact of parenthood compare to and interact with the impact of marital status?</p>
<p>Answering these questions not only provides greater understanding of the 2008 presidential election, but adds richness to our understanding of political socialization throughout the life cycle by allowing us to explore the extent to which the experience of raising a family is a politically defining experience. Psychologists, sociologists, and family studies experts have empirically documented what most intuitively know to be the case: that becoming a parent is associated with profound changes in one’s daily life routine, self-conception, and lens through which one views the world. Parenthood entails dealing with tighter finances, changing how and with whom one socializes, and introduces a salient new social role as a mother or father (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532673X11400015">Gallagher &amp; Gerstel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532673X11400015">Munch, McPherson &amp; Smith-Lovin, 1997</xref>). Studies document that parenthood has a significant effect on people’s well-being, level of stress, and overall outlook on life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532673X11400015">McLanahan &amp; Adams, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532673X11400015">Nomaguchi &amp; Milkie, 2003</xref>). Put simply, existing research documents that, “You think differently when you have kids” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11400015">Barnes, 1992</xref>, p. 50).</p>
<p>This project extends the work of sociologists and psychologists into the realm of politics by examining whether parenthood is associated with distinctive political attitudes. We argue that parenthood represents a significant and underexplored agent of adult political socialization. Studies have documented attitudinal changes associated with key adult experiences such as joining the workforce, getting married, growing older, and retiring (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532673X11400015">Andersen &amp; Cook, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1532673X11400015">Pedersen, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532673X11400015">Ponza, Duncan, Corcoran, &amp; Groskind, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1532673X11400015">Stoker &amp; Jennings, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1532673X11400015">Weisberg, 1987</xref>). We hypothesize that parenthood may rival if not surpass these other experiences in its potential to bring about changes in adults’ political outlooks. While some studies have examined the impact of having children on the level and type of political <italic>participation</italic> among adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532673X11400015">Burns, Schlozman, &amp; Verba, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532673X11400015">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1532673X11400015">Jennings, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1532673X11400015">Sapiro, 1983</xref>), only a handful have extended this line of research to examine political <italic>attitudes</italic> as we do here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11400015">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X11400015">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532673X11400015">Greenlee, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532673X11400015">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, this research on the political impact of parenthood enriches our understanding of the causes of the gender gap in American politics. Even at the start of the 21st century, women and men carry out significantly different roles in the parenting process, and this project allows us to examine the ways this gendered experience influences the contours and outcomes of American electoral politics. While much research has assumed that there is something about motherhood that contributes to the more liberal views of women in comparison to men, this study provides a rigorous empirical exploration of the issue. Finally, the politicization of parenthood holds important consequences for election outcomes, group representation, and the future of the Democratic and Republican parties, all of which we discuss in our conclusion.</p>

<title>The Politics of Parenthood: Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Adult socialization theory implies that parents will have a unique perspective on issues connected to children’s needs and well-being. As parents nurture and provide for their children, it seems likely that they would develop distinctive attitudes on issues affecting children’s lives such as government spending on education, day care, and health care as well as issues that have implications for their children’s safety such as national security and war policy, and policies connected to conceptions of the family and “family values” including gay marriage and abortion. The socialization literature implies that the magnitude and ideological direction of parenthood effects may vary depending on two factors: the issue domain and the sex of the parent because the experience of parents differs quite significantly across the sexes and across issue domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532673X11400015">Munch et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>We expect parenthood to have different impacts on mothers versus fathers in large part because women and men, in the aggregate, continue to play very different roles in the parenting process—roles shaped by gendered societal expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X11400015">Bianchi, Robinson, &amp; Milkie, 2006</xref>). Despite dramatic changes to the American family over the past half century, including the massive influx of mothers into the paid workforce, the idea that mothers are supposed to take care of the home and be all-giving to their children retains a strong foothold in American culture. Mothers still take on the majority of child care responsibilities and act as the primary caregiver for their children, even in families where both parents work full time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11400015">Belkin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532673X11400015">Bianchi, 2000</xref>). For men, it is still the case that being a good parent means working outside the home and providing economically for their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1532673X11400015">Townsend, 2002</xref>). In fact, studies reveal that men respond to fatherhood by increasing their hours at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532673X11400015">Burns et al., 2001</xref>, p. 311; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X11400015">Lunberg &amp; Rose, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1532673X11400015">2002</xref>). Given the different ways they experience parenthood, we expect the politics of parenthood to look differently for fathers and mothers.</p>
<p>In addition to the expectations borne out of the adult socialization literature, we expect that parenthood shaped attitudes during the 2008 election because parenthood and the family were major themes in the campaigns of both presidential candidates and because the media leaned heavily on family and parenthood frames in their coverage of the election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2009</xref>). While parenthood and the family have been leading themes in election coverage for several election cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532673X11400015">Carroll, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11400015">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532673X11400015">Kaufmann, Petrocik, &amp; Shaw, 2008</xref>), the 2008 election stands as distinctive in this regard, driven in large part by the presence of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, her status as a working mother of five, and her self-identification as a “Hockey Mom.” Her presence in the 2008 campaign led to an array of family and parenthood themed election stories and a 56-year highpoint in election related articles using “mothers” as news frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2009</xref>). In addition, the parties relied on parenthood and family frames to discuss the most important issues of the 2008 election, the broad role of government in our society and domestic economic policy. The heavy focus on parenthood and family by both the parties and the media is significant because it fostered an electoral environment in which people were primed to think about their parental roles and familial concerns when considering political issues and candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X11400015">Cohen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1532673X11400015">Iyengar &amp; Kinder, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1532673X11400015">Krosnick &amp; Kinder, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532673X11400015">Nelson &amp; Oxley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1532673X11400015">Terkildsen &amp; Schnell, 1997</xref>). Below we outline our specific expectations for motherhood and fatherhood effects in each of three policy realms: social welfare policies, war and defense policy, and cultural values issues as well as for candidate evaluations.</p>

<title>The Political Effects of Parenthood: Hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section3-1532673X11400015">
<title>Parenthood and the Role of Government</title>
<p>While the presidential candidates evoked the imagery of family and parenthood in reference to a wide number of policies during the 2008 election, they leaned on such language most heavily to frame their broad governing philosophies and their contrasting stances on economic and social welfare issues, a connection that was reinforced in media coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2009</xref>). During the 2008 campaign, Republican candidate John McCain made the case that tax cuts and a smaller government were necessary for the health of the American family, especially in tough economic times. He also argued that big government undermines parental rights and the traditional family. Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Barack Obama argued that truly valuing families requires increased government spending on programs closely connected to raising children including education and health care, as well as government action to ensure Americans get jobs with good pay and combat poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2009</xref>). The heavy use of family and parenthood frames by both major party candidates to discuss social welfare policies during the 2008 election is a central reason we expect parents to possess distinct views in this policy realm.</p>
<p>In addition to the parent frames used to discuss social welfare policy during the 2008 election, the adult socialization literature and the specific ways that parenthood affects the lives of adults lead us to expect that the strongest and most consistent parenthood effects will be found on role of government issues such as education, health care, and child care as well as assistance to the poor and the broader role of government in providing services. We expect that mothers will be more distinctive on this set of issues than fathers since this is the general set of issues where mothers are most involved and responsible on a day-to-day basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X11400015">Bianchi et al., 2006</xref>). We expect motherhood to predict more liberal attitudes in this issue area for several reasons. First, the majority of mothers who are struggling to balance work along with care of their children may come to appreciate a more robust role of government in providing programs, health care, and other services. In fact, much of the scholarship on the gender gap has hypothesized that the modest but long-standing gender gap on social welfare and economic issues is, in part, the product of women’s experience as mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11400015">Andersen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532673X11400015">Iversen &amp; Rosenbluth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1532673X11400015">Welch &amp; Hibbing, 1992</xref>). Second, becoming a mother transitions many women into direct reliance on government services including public assistance programs for at least some portion of their lives, which in turn may foster their appreciation for government spending and programs designed to help others even if they are not currently benefitting from such programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X11400015">Budig &amp; England, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1532673X11400015">Lugaila, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532673X11400015">Waite &amp; Gallagher, 2000</xref>). Third, there is a vein of feminist theory that posits that the actual act of nurturing and caring for children fosters more compassionate and liberal attitudes on a broad range of social welfare programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532673X11400015">Elshtain, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1532673X11400015">Ruddick, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1532673X11400015">Sapiro, 1983</xref>). Finally, previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X11400015">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532673X11400015">Howell &amp; Day, 2000</xref>), using data from years prior to 2008, has found a consistent liberal motherhood effect on social welfare issue attitudes.</p>
<p>In contrast, we expect to find that fatherhood has a comparatively smaller impact on social welfare attitudes since fathers are less involved in the day-to-day care of their children. As for the ideological direction of fatherhood effects, our expectations are less clear. On one hand, given their assumed responsibilities to provide economically for their families, fathers have reason to embrace more conservative attitudes on economic and social welfare policies. Although an expanded social welfare state may potentially ease the burden of their working wives, men’s paychecks are whittled down by such policies, which men may perceive as undermining their ability to support their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532673X11400015">Iversen &amp; Rosenbluth, 2006</xref>). Moreover, two empirical studies using data from the 1990s found that parenthood pushes women and men in opposite ideological directions on social welfare issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532673X11400015">Howell &amp; Day, 2000</xref>). On the other hand, studies have shown that men today are more likely than past cohorts to believe that fathers should share equally in care giving and that contemporary fathers do in fact spend more “focused time” with their children than fathers of previous generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X11400015">Bianchi et al., 2006</xref>, pp. 127 &amp; 171). Thus, as of 2008, it would not be surprising to see fatherhood associated with modest liberal effects on social welfare attitudes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1532673X11400015">
<title>Parenthood, War, and Defense Spending</title>
<p>Our second set of hypotheses focus on war and defense policy. We hypothesize that motherhood, but not fatherhood, will be associated with more liberal attitudes in this issue realm based on the work of some feminist scholars who have argued that mothers possess more antimilitaristic attitudes because of their unique role in having and raising children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532673X11400015">Elshtain, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532673X11400015">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532673X11400015">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1532673X11400015">Ruddick, 1989</xref>). One of the most prominent scholars to articulate this position, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1532673X11400015">Sara Ruddick (1983)</xref>, has argued that “Out of maternal practice a distinctive kind of thinking arises that is incompatible with military strategy but consonant with pacifist commitment to non-violence” (p. 233). On the other hand, in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, news outlets generated a different image of the relationship between military/war issues and parenthood. “Security Mom” and to a lesser extent “Nascar Dad” stories portrayed parents as being distinctively conservative on defense and security issues as a direct result of their role as protectors of their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11400015">Carroll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2007a</xref>). The few studies that have actually used empirical data to explore whether mothers or fathers are distinctive on national security or war-related issues have found either no significant parenthood effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11400015">Bendyna, Finucane, Kirby, O’Donnell, &amp; Wilcox, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532673X11400015">Conover &amp; Sapiro, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2007a</xref>) or that mothers are slightly more liberal on such issues while fathers are slightly more conservative than their nonparent counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11400015">2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1532673X11400015">
<title>Parenthood and Cultural Values Issues</title>
<p>Turning to the third issue area we examine in this study, cultural values or social issues, our expectations are that parents will have distinctive attitudes on these issues in part because the presidential candidates explicitly appealed to parents with such issues throughout the 2008 election. Although the topic of fatherhood received less coverage than “Hockey Moms” and “Wal-mart Moms,” both parties made explicit appeals to parents using “family values” themes—and many of these appeals were directed squarely at fathers. In his 2008 Democratic Convention speech, for example, candidate Obama stated that “fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.” This message was not only a continuation of the Democratic strategy begun under President Clinton to fight the Republicans over the territory of “family values,” but was a means of reaching out to parents, especially married fathers, who have represented an area of electoral weakness for the Democratic party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11400015">Dionne, 2008</xref>). During the 2008 campaign, the Republican party continued to emphasize conservative positions on abortion and gay marriage in their appeals to parents as they had in previous elections although the vice presidential candidacy of Sarah Palin brought new force and attention to such positions. Thus we expect parents to hold distinctively conservative attitudes on family values issues as they seek to protect their children from negative cultural influences.</p>

<title>Parenthood and Candidate Evaluations</title>
<p>Both presidential candidates relied heavily on family and parental rhetoric in their appeals to the American electorate. As discussed previously, both Barack Obama and John McCain made explicit appeals to parents and repeatedly emphasized that the policies they would enact as president would help support and strengthen American families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Green, 2009</xref>). The media’s parenthood focus, however, was greatest on Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. A great number of news articles during the 2008 election discussed the electoral implications of Sarah Palin’s status as a “Hockey Mom” and working mother, and suggested that Palin’s presence on the Republican ticket would be a strong draw for parents, especially mothers. For example, one news article reported that, according to the McCain campaign, “any mother shuttling her children between school and sports or music classes can identify with Palin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11400015">Goldenberg, 2008</xref>, p. 1). A column in <italic>The New York Times</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1532673X11400015">William Kristol (2008)</xref> emphasized that “McCain didn’t just pick a politician who could appeal to ‘Wal-mart Moms.’ He picked a ‘Wal-mart Mom’ (p. A23).” Given the efforts both presidential tickets made to appeal to parents, we wanted to explore whether parents were distinctive in their evaluations of any of the presidential or vice presidential candidates. We were particularly interested in seeing whether mothers were in fact particularly positive in their feelings toward Sarah Palin as many media stories implied they would be.</p>

<title>The Effects of Parenthood Across Marital Status</title>
<p>A full exploration of the political impact of parenthood also requires some discussion of marriage. Parenthood and marriage are heavily intertwined adult socialization experiences. While the rate of single parenthood has increased over the past several decades, for the majority of parents, about 68%, parenthood and marriage still go hand in hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532673X11400015">Fields, 2004</xref>). In addition, there are reasons to expect parenthood may shape attitudes differently depending on whether parenting occurs in the context of a marriage or not. We hypothesize that the liberalizing impact of motherhood on social welfare or role of government attitudes will be heightened among single mothers, as the parenting experience in such cases may be even more intense, which in turn should foster increased support and appreciation for a more robust and active government. In addition, we expect to find a heightened conservatism on cultural values issues among married parents. Much of the social science research on “the marriage gap” suggests that those who marry not only have more conservative predispositions to begin with but also become more conservative because they are drawn to defend their decision to get and stay married in a society where such a lifestyle choice is increasingly uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532673X11400015">Gerson, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X11400015">1987</xref>; Harden, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1532673X11400015">Plissner, 1983</xref>). Building on this literature, we expect to find that married parents will have distinctively conservative attitudes on cultural values issues driven by their desire to “defend” their choices in terms of marriage and children, and protect their families from what are seen by some as negative influences. Capturing this idea, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532673X11400015">Barbara Dafoe Whitehead (2004)</xref>, a vocal advocate for the traditional family, argued that “The widening marriage gap is a potent reminder of the salience of cultural issues for married parents” (pp. 11-12).</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>This article uses data from the 2008 National Election Study to assess the role of parenthood in shaping citizen attitudes in three central policy realms as well as evaluations of the major party presidential and vice presidential candidates. We chose to employ NES data because this data set contains the best array of well-constructed political attitude measures. To explore our hypotheses about the effects of parenthood on role of government, war/defense, and cultural values issues, we conducted a number of OLS multivariate analyses<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532673X11400015">2</xref></sup> with parent as the key independent variable, which we discuss in more detail below. To aid in interpretation, all the directional political variables in our models are coded so that higher values indicate more conservative attitudes. Full details on all variables can be found in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1532673X11400015">appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>We turn first to our dependent variables. To test our first set of hypotheses concerning the effects of parenthood on attitudes concerning the role of government, we ran seven regression models with relevant social welfare attitudes as dependent variables: the standard NES 7-point questions on health care, government support for jobs, and level of government services<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532673X11400015">3</xref></sup> as well as items querying support for federal spending on aid to the poor, welfare, child care, and public schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532673X11400015">4</xref></sup> These results are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11400015">Tables 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11400015">3</xref>.</p>

<p>To test our second set of hypotheses concerning the impact of motherhood and fatherhood on war and defense issues we ran three models, which are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1532673X11400015">Table 4</xref>. The first model explores the impact of parenthood on whether the respondent believes the Iraq War was “worth it” and the second model uses approval for Bush’s handling of Iraq as the dependent variable. The third model uses the standard NES 7-point scale on defense spending as the dependent variable.</p>

<p>To test our hypotheses concerning cultural values issues we use attitudes on abortion and gay marriage as our dependent variables. We used the new NES abortion questions that incorporate the thoroughness of the General Social Survey measures (six yes/no questions querying support for abortion under a variety of potential circumstances) with more nuanced 9-point response categories. The gay marriage item allowed for responses of no government recognition, civil unions, or gay marriage and runs from 1 to 3 with 3 being the most conservative response (no government recognition). The results of our regressions on these cultural values issues are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1532673X11400015">Table 5</xref>.</p>

<p>As discussed, we were also interested to see whether parents were distinctively attracted to any of the presidential or vice presidential candidates, especially Sarah Palin, so we employed the feeling thermometer question of affect towards Obama, McCain, Biden, and Palin, ranging from 0 to 100, as our final set of dependent variables.

<p>The key independent variable in all of our analyses is parenthood. For our analyses, we coded all those who said they had a child under 18 living in their home as parents. This measure is not perfect since a small percentage of adults live with children under 18 who are not their own children and because this measure excludes parents with grown children<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532673X11400015">5</xref></sup> and parents who do not live with their children, but it is the best measure available. In addition, given that the political focus on parenthood and families primarily targets households with minor children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2006b</xref>) and the day-to-day impact of children on the lives of parents is greatest while children are still dependents living in the household, we think it is appropriate to measure parenthood in this regard. Finally, to the degree that this measure captures a small portion of respondents who are not actually parents, this should attenuate our results so as to create a bias toward the null hypothesis and not in favor of our findings.</p>
<p>Because parenthood and marriage are heavily intertwined adult socialization experiences, and there are reasons to expect parenthood effects on some issue attitudes might be heightened depending on marital status, we not only include a marriage variable in our models but also include a parent−marriage interaction. Through these models, we are able to explore the impact of parenthood and marriage as well as whether marital status heightens the impact of parenthood.</p>
<p>Due to the strong theoretical and empirical reasons to expect that parental status should interact with gender to affect political opinions, we estimated separate models for men and women.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532673X11400015">6</xref></sup> In other words, we estimated two regressions models for all of our dependent variables. In addition, it is important to point out that in all our models we control for a range of demographic and political factors including age, income, education, race, employment status, religiosity, fundamentalism, born again status, partisanship, and attitudes on feminism. Controlling for these basic political attitudes and demographics is important since they have been found to correlate with gender, parental status, and political views. Their inclusion allows us to rule out alternative explanations for any motherhood or fatherhood effects we find.</p>

<title>Results: Parenthood Effects on Political Attitudes and Candidate Evaluations</title>
<sec id="section10-1532673X11400015">
<title>Parenthood and the Role of Government</title>
<p>We begin by looking for parenthood effects on issues connected with the appropriate role of government. The multivariate regression results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11400015">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11400015">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11400015">3</xref> indicate that mothers are statistically and substantively more likely than their nonmother counterparts to support the government playing an active role in providing a range of programs and services to citizens, especially those in need. Interestingly and surprisingly, motherhood does not predict more liberal attitudes on the two issues most closely connected with parenthood, spending on education and spending on child care (we discuss these results more below) but does predict more liberal attitudes on all other role of government issues examined including health care, government provision of jobs, government spending and services, aid to the poor, and welfare (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11400015">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11400015">3</xref>). It is not just that motherhood is a consistent, statistically significant predictor of liberal attitudes in these five models, but the effect is quite substantive. For example, in almost all cases being a mother is a stronger predictor in shaping women’s social welfare attitudes than variables that have received considerably more attention in the public opinion literature including marital status, race, and employment status. Moreover, the fact that the liberal effect of motherhood remains significant in regression models when potentially confounding variables are controlled means that it is not simply Democratic or poor mothers that are driving the liberal motherhood effect. Consistent with some feminist theories, there seems to be something about the experience of being a mother and nurturing children that leads to more compassionate political attitudes on role of government issues across the board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1532673X11400015">Ruddick, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1532673X11400015">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1532673X11400015">Sapiro, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>We predicted that the marriage−parent interaction would indicate that single mothers held particularly liberal attitudes in this issue realm, but this expectation was not born out. None of the parent−marriage interactions in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11400015">Tables 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11400015">3</xref> were significant for women. This suggests, once again, that motherhood is a driving force in liberalizing attitudes across the board, regardless of whether it occurs within the context of a marriage or not. Interestingly, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11400015">Table 2</xref> show that being married also proves to be a significant predictor of more liberal attitudes for women on two social welfare issues: the role of government in providing health care and the role of government in providing jobs and a good standard of living but not on the other five social welfare items. We believe the reason for these two significant marriage effects may be similar to the force behind the motherhood effects. When women marry they not only begin to worry about and take responsibility for their husband’s health and job security, but often take on the responsibility of caring for their husbands’ older relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1532673X11400015">Pierret, 2006</xref>). For women, being part of a family-based partnership may therefore foster appreciation government’s role in providing health care, jobs, and a decent standard of living. Since marriage tends to enhance socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532673X11400015">Waite &amp; Gallagher, 2000</xref>), it is not surprising to find marriage is not associated with more liberal attitudes on other social welfare issues, such as government spending on the poor or on welfare.</p>
<p>The lack of motherhood effects on the two issues most closely connected to parenting, government spending on child care and education (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11400015">Table 1</xref>), is surprising and somewhat puzzling. Rational choice or self-interest theories of public opinion suggest that individuals develop attitudes about policies based on reasonable assessments of their own self-interest (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532673X11400015">Green &amp; Gerken, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532673X11400015">Ponza et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1532673X11400015">Tedin, Matland, &amp; Weiher, 2001</xref>). If this theory was motivating motherhood effects, we would particularly expect to find mothers to be more supportive of government spending on education and day care. The fact that we did not find significant motherhood effects on these two issues<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532673X11400015">7</xref></sup> suggests that motherhood effects are not driven by pure self-interest to support programs immediately benefitting their children, but that having and raising children fosters broader support for a more “nurturing,” active, and helpful government. The pattern of results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11400015">Tables 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11400015">3</xref> overall lend support for the idea that motherhood effects are the result of “maternal thinking” as articulated by feminist thinkers such as Sara Ruddick and Jean Elshtain, rather than a product of narrower self-interest.</p>
<p>Turning to men, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11400015">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11400015">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11400015">3</xref> show that fatherhood has very few effects in this issue realm. The one significant effect is the marriage–parent interaction in the education model, and it is in the conservative direction. While there are no main effects for being a father or marital status, it does appear that being a married father in particular may drive more conservative attitudes. The fact that parenthood shapes the social welfare attitudes of women much more than men is in line with research showing parenthood contributes to much greater day-to-day life changes and responsibilities for women than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532673X11400015">Nomaguchi &amp; Milkie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532673X11400015">Waite &amp; Gallagher, 2000</xref>). Moreover, the fact that parenthood moves women in a liberal direction on most role of government issues and has very little impact on men is consistent with previous studies showing that parenthood drives men and women further apart on social welfare issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532673X11400015">Howell &amp; Day, 2000</xref>). Taken as a whole, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11400015">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11400015">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11400015">3</xref> are consistent with the argument that mothers, and in some cases wives, come to view a generous social welfare state as an asset in their attempts to juggle work and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532673X11400015">Iversen &amp; Rosenbluth, 2006</xref>), while having no parallel impact on men.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1532673X11400015">
<title>Parenthood, War, and Defense Spending</title>
<p>Next we examined the relationship between parenthood and attitudes on the Iraq War as well as defense spending. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1532673X11400015">Table 4</xref> shows that being a mother is a significant predictor of more liberal or antiwar attitudes on both of the Iraq War measures we employed. Thus our results strongly rebuke the “Security Mom” image and provide empirical support for the “maternal thinking” theory that motherhood is associated with more pacifist views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532673X11400015">Elshtain, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532673X11400015">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532673X11400015">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1532673X11400015">Ruddick, 1989</xref>). Interestingly, marriage is a significant predictor of women’s attitudes about Bush’s handling of the Iraq War but in a conservative direction. Despite the fact that marriage and parenthood are often lumped together in media as well as some scholarly analyses of politics, it is important to understand that on some important political issues, marriage and parenthood produce cross-cutting pressures on women.</p>
<p>While we found mothers to be significantly less supportive of the Iraq War, we did not find mothers to be distinctive on the issue of defense spending. We argue that the liberal motherhood effect on Iraq War related issues is rooted in the role of mothers as protectors and nurturers of their children. Not only are mothers concerned with sending their own children off to war but there may be something about the process of nurturing and caring for children that leads to more pacifist views when it comes to war. The liberal motherhood effect, therefore, would be most evident on national security issues that are strongly and explicitly linked to military action and the loss of life, the most prominent example of which would be the Iraq War, rather than issues such as defense spending. In addition, it is important to point out that previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2007a</xref>) has shown that in every year from 1980 through the present, mothers like women overall, are significantly more liberal than fathers and men on the issue of defense spending—a finding repeated in 2008. In other words, while mothers are not uniquely liberal on defense spending compared to their nonmother counterparts, they are distinctively liberal compared to fathers and men, which is a very different reality than the image captured by the “Security Mom” label.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1532673X11400015">Table 4</xref> also shows that being a parent does not shape attitudes on the Iraq War for men. This is consistent with our expectations since men are less involved in the nurturing aspect of child rearing. We thought that men might respond to their roles as husbands and fathers by wanting to spend more on the military to “defend” their families and the nation and only found weak support. The direction of the coefficient for the defense spending variable is consistent with this hypothesis, but the results fall just shy of the .05 level of statistical significance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1532673X11400015">
<title>Parents and Cultural Values Issues</title>
<p>Turning to the third policy area we examined, cultural values issues, our results show that marriage, not parenthood, drives attitudes in this area for women. More specifically, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1532673X11400015">Table 5</xref> shows that being married significantly predicts more conservative attitudes on abortion and gay marriage for women, while parenthood has no effect. None of the marriage–parent interactions are significant either. Much conventional wisdom and media commentary suggests that parents are a distinctively conservative group on cultural values issues such as abortion and gay marriage (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11400015">Barnes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532673X11400015">Brooks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532673X11400015">Whitehead, 2004</xref>). Our regression results reveal that there is something about marriage—or the type of person who chooses to get marriage—which is associated with more conservative attitudes on some social issues for women, but that “something” is not having children; Nor does having children heighten the conservatizing impact of marriage in this issue realm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1532673X11400015">Table 5</xref> shows that fathers are significantly more conservative on the issue of gay marriage. This is consistent with our hypothesis that fathers may hold distinctively conservative attitudes on family values issues as they seek to protect their children from what they perceive to be negative cultural influences, a theme particularly highlighted in media coverage of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during the 2008 election.</p>

<p>In addition to examining parenthood effects in specific issue domains, we also looked at the impact of parenthood on feelings toward all of the 2008 major party presidential and vice presidential candidates. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1532673X11400015">Table 6</xref> shows the results of three multivariate regression analyses with feeling thermometers toward Obama, McCain, and Palin as the dependent variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532673X11400015">8</xref></sup> The first two columns show that despite Obama’s efforts to appeal to parents through his profamily and responsible fatherhood rhetoric, he was not successful at generating distinctively political evaluations from mothers or fathers. The next two columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1532673X11400015">Table 6</xref> show that McCain, like Obama, was also unsuccessful in crafting an appeal that was distinctively attractive to parents.</p>
<p>We were particularly interested in looking at the role of parenthood in shaping attitudes toward Sarah Palin given the media’s emphasis on how her status as a “Hockey Mom” and mother of five might appeal to parents, particularly mothers. The last two columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1532673X11400015">Table 6</xref> show that parental status did not predict warmer feelings toward Sarah Palin for men or women. In other words, Sarah Palin’s vice presidential candidacy did not hold any special appeal to mothers or fathers. In fact, for women, the parent–marriage interaction variable is significant and negative indicating that, contrary to much conventional wisdom, Palin fared particularly poorly among married mothers when controlling for other related demographic factors. Thus the McCain campaign’s attempts to woo married mothers by the addition of Sarah Palin to the Republican ticket appear to have backfired. It is also worth noting that analyses of vote choice, not shown here, similarly revealed that the Republican ticket did not benefit from any motherhood or fatherhood bump in 2008. In fact similar to previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532673X11400015">Kaufmann et al., 2008</xref>) mean voting scores reveal that mothers, like women overall, were a very solid Democratic voting bloc in 2008.</p>

<title>Parenthood Effects: Theoretical and Practical Significance</title>
<p>Overall this study shows that parenthood was a significant political force during the 2008 election season. The parenthood effects documented in this study have both theoretical and practical importance. Turning first to the theoretical, we find evidence that parenthood is an important agent of adult political socialization. Given the profound and long-term ways having and raising children changes the lives of adults it is not surprising to find that there are significant consequences for political attitudes, but so far political science literature has given scant attention to understanding the political role of parenthood. Admittedly, our results are based on cross-section analysis, which prevents us from controlling for selection into parenthood and proving causality. Nevertheless, we strongly suspect that the parenthood effects are not purely the product of selection effects. It seems implausible, for example, that women with distinctively liberal attitudes would be so much more likely to have children than women with more conservative views. Moreover, the socialization literature provides a strong theoretical foundation for expecting that parenthood would shape the political attitudes of parents.</p>
<p>Second, this study makes an important contribution to gender gap theories in American politics. One of the themes characterizing our results is that on two policy domains central to the gender gap—role of government issues and war policy—parenthood pushes men and women further apart ideologically. Mothers are distinctively liberal on five different social welfare issues including health care and aid to the poor, as well as in their attitudes towards the Iraq War. Men, in contrast, are hardly affected by their parental status. The different ways parenthood influences the attitudes of women and men, including the minimal effects of fatherhood, are crucially important as they underscore the extent to which parenting is still a highly gendered experience even in the 21st century and that the ramifications of family life extend to the political realm. In addition, some research on the gender gap has assumed that the gendered nature of parenthood might be a force behind the gap, but this research provides empirical evidence for the idea as it pushes women in a liberal direction while having no parallel effect on men. The results also lend support to the “maternal hypothesis” theory advanced by some feminist scholars that the act of mothering or nurturing fosters more compassionate attitudes.</p>
<p>We argue that the different effects of parenthood on men and women are rooted in two social and political forces, the different roles and expectations of mothers and fathers in American society as well as the divergent messages of the political parties concerning parenthood and family. In other words, it is a combination of a gendered adult political socialization experience and the “parenthood” priming that occurred during the 2008 presidential election. Although the increasing use of family-friendly appeals has been bipartisan, the experience of contemporary mothers appears most in line with the messages coming from the Democratic party and its pledge to help working families through more government regulation (e.g., mandating family leave policies, raising the minimum wage) and supporting increased funding for government programs including health care, assistance to the needy, and job training as well as the party’s critique of the Iraq War. On the other hand, being a father predicts a more conservative stance on gay marriage, which is in line with Republican emphasis on the importance of traditional families.</p>
<p>Not only is the divergent effects of parenthood on women and men important in terms of our understanding of the interplay between parenthood and gender in contemporary politics but also does it underscore the importance of analyzing parenthood results separately for women and men. Comparing parents as a group to nonparents as some studies have done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532673X11400015">Arnold &amp; Weisberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11400015">Barnes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1532673X11400015">Teixeira, 2002</xref>) actually produces an inaccurate picture of parents on most policy issues and political variables.</p>
<p>Marriage and parenthood are closely intertwined adult experiences. Even though a growing number of parents are not married and a growing number of married couples do not have children, more often than not, parenthood and marriage go hand in hand. What our analyses show, however, is that parenthood and marriage do not always have reinforcing effects on political attitudes, which makes sense given that these two experiences affect the lives of adults, especially women, in very different ways. Motherhood is a significant predictor of more liberal attitudes on role of government as well as war-related issues, while motherhood has no impact on cultural values attitudes. Meanwhile, being married has a conservative impact on one of our Iraq War evaluations and on both abortion and gay marriage. We believe these results further underscore that the way the two life experiences of marriage and parenthood have been conflated in both social science literature and news analyses is problematic. Further research needs to be all the more careful in separating, both theoretically and empirically, the effects of marriage and parenthood.</p>
<p>In addition to its theoretical contributions, the distinct attitudes of parents have numerous implications for elite political behavior and electoral outcomes. According to exit polls, parents of children under 18 formed 40% of the electorate in 2008, a sizable bloc of voters. Whichever party or candidate is more successful in appealing to parents has a definite edge toward victory in this extremely divided electorate. In addition, family and parenting themes are classic valence issues that have broad appeal even among those who are not parents. Given this, we expect parenthood to only become more prominent in the political appeals of both parties and therefore in shaping political attitudes in future elections. In further analyses, we plan to extend this work back in time as well as through future elections, so we can examine the extent to which parental identities shape political attitudes in election years where parenthood is and is not a prominent theme.</p>
<p>While the major parties are vying to be seen as the true champion of the American family, our results combined with recent demographic data suggest that the politics of parenthood favor the Democratic party. Scholarship has already shown that the changing demographics of American society will likely favor the Democratic party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1532673X11400015">Judis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532673X11400015">Judis &amp; Teixeira, 2002</xref>), and this is especially the case for parents. A disproportionately high percentage of new parents are non-White and economically disadvantaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11400015">Dye, 2005</xref>), groups that are highly Democratic. Moreover, the Republican parties’ emphasis on traditional families is increasingly out of step with the 30% of families headed by single parents and the 80% of families with working mothers, two groups that have been growing in size.</p>
<p>Many would argue that having the major parties focus their energies on parents and family-friendly policies is an all around positive development. Nevertheless, this politicization of parenthood appears to have come at a cost for the representation and mobilization of some groups within society. Other research has shown that increasingly both parties have come to target their family-friendly appeals to middle class, married parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11400015">2009</xref>). In other words, neither party is particularly interested in being the champion of single mothers or poor families and neither party is aggressively advocating policies that would help those groups. Thus, while some families are garnering the attention of political elites, other types of families are being marginalized. In addition, research has suggested that the increase in family-themed appeals has come at the expense of attention to women’s rights and feminist issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11400015">Carroll, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532673X11400015">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X11400015">Freeman, 1997</xref>, p. 365; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1532673X11400015">Sanbonmatsu, 2004</xref>, p. 226). This is a cause for concern since “women’s issues” are not interchangeable with the interests of mothers. In addition, the marginalization of women’s issues makes meaningful progress on this set of issues less likely.</p>
<p>Beyond the implications for election outcomes and representation, this study also reinforces earlier findings that the media are getting the story quite wrong in their reporting of the politics of parenthood and that much of the conventional wisdom about the politics of parenthood is wrong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532673X11400015">Carroll, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11400015">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11400015">Elder &amp; Greene, 2007a</xref>). The “Security Mom” label that dominated much news coverage in previous election cycles is clearly inaccurate. As of 2008, mothers are less supportive of the Iraq War and significantly more supportive of a generous social welfare state. More accurate labels would be <italic>Pro-Government Mothers</italic> or <italic>Health Care Moms</italic>. In addition, conventional wisdom and media commentary suggesting parents would be particularly attracted to the candidacy of Sarah Palin was not at all accurate. Despite all of Sarah Palin’s “Hockey Mom” based appeals, she garnered no additional support from mothers or fathers. Since most Americans, as well as the candidates and parties, look to the media to better understand the political environment, these inaccuracies are troubling.</p>
<p>While this article provides evidence that parenthood shaped some issue attitudes in 2008, and thus represents an important, and for the most part, overlooked adult socialization experience, we believe there is much more to be explored in terms of the politics of parenthood. As discussed previously, there is a need to extend the analysis of parenthood effects both back in time and across future election years. In addition, we believe the intriguing results found in this study underscore the need for improved and more nuanced measures of parenting that allow us to better understand what exactly it is about the mothering as well as the fathering experience that has political consequences as well as document and explore any lifelong effects of parenthood on political attitudes.</p>

<p>On Father’s Day in 2008, Barack Obama gave a widely covered speech urging fathers, especially Black fathers, to take more responsibility for their children. The theme of responsible fatherhood was also a part of Barack Obama’s 2008 Democratic Nomination acceptance speech. The actual phrase “Responsible Fatherhood,” however, comes from an initiative launched by the Obama administration in June 2009, which President Obama described as a “national conversation on responsible fatherhood and healthy families” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532673X11400015">Cooper, 2009</xref>, p.

<p>In 2008, NES began a new series of questions related to role of government issues. Half the same received the traditional questions and half received the new questions. We use the half sample that received the traditional measures because they are more valid measures of the attitudes we are interested in, whereas the “new” questions make little effort to measure the same core concepts. For example, the traditional health care question asks about support for a government health insurance plan, whereas the new health care question asks about the much more narrow issue of government subsidized prescription drugs for elderly. Similarly, the traditional jobs question queried respondents on whether the government should see to it that people get a job and a decent standard of living, whereas the new jobs question asks respondents whether they favor or oppose allowing illegal immigrants to work in the United States for up to 3 years.</p>

<p>The lifelong impact of parenthood, even once children have left the home, is clearly an interesting and worthy question that is beyond the scope of the present research.

We believe this is the best approach for answering our particular research questions because of our expectation that becoming parents and raising children may affect women and men differently. Using separate equations allows us to examine whether being a parent influences the attitudes of moms and dads in opposite directions, information that would be obscured by using one model with an interaction term for gender.</p>
