<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Telemedicine carries the potential of improving accessibility to health services, especially for disabled people.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To assess the health-related outcomes of short-term implementation of telemedicine (telemed) for MS patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective study of 40 MS patients divided into a control group and a telemed group was conducted, in two stages: A. Six months’ follow-up for measurement of baseline health-related variables; B. Implementation stage, adding home telecare to the telemed group. A Health Value Compass was applied to assess the outcomes of home telecare implementation. Clinical status, cost data, patients’ self-assessment of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and satisfaction with telecare were studied.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients in the telemed group demonstrated improved clinical outcome measured by symptoms severity. There was a decrease of at least 35% in the medical costs for 67% of the telemed group patients. Satisfaction with telecare was high and most patients would recommend this service to others.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The present pilot study, applying Health Value Compass-based analysis, suggests that telecare is a powerful tool for monitoring MS patients at home, carries the potential to improve health care while reducing costs, and should be considered for implementation as part of the management of chronic neurological diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common neurologic disease affecting young adults, can lead to severe physical disability and handicap.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511421918">1</xref></sup> Although recent years have provided a breakthrough in the diagnosis and treatment of MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511421918">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511421918">3</xref></sup> numerous patients are unable to take full advantage of these developments because of limited mobility and accessibility to medical services.</p>
<p>One of the possible ways to improve accessibility is by telemedicine, that is, using telecommunications to provide health care services at a distant site, such as at the patient’s home.</p>
<p>Neurology seems to be a medical specialty which could take advantage of the telemedicine approach, and several systems for teleneurology have been developed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511421918">4</xref></sup> including for MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511421918">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511421918">6</xref></sup> A Home Automated Telemanagement system to monitor symptoms, educate on the disease, and monitor exercise tailored to the patient has been developed and successfully implemented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511421918">7</xref></sup> A preliminary study of feasibility and patient acceptance of physical telerehabilitation in MS demonstrated that functional outcomes increased and patients were highly satisfied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511421918">8</xref></sup> However, extended studies that evaluate both costs and benefits of telecare in MS, as well as in other specialties, although needed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511421918">9</xref></sup> have not yet been conducted.</p>
<p>The Clinical Value Compass, named to reflect its similarity to a directional compass, is a tool used to evaluate changes in clinical processes. It has at its four cardinal points: 1′– functional status, risk status, and well-being; 2′– costs; 3′– satisfaction with health care and perceived benefit; and 4′– clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511421918">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The objective of this study was to assess the benefits of short-term implementation of telecare for MS patients using the Clinical Value Compass.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458511421918">
<title>Patients and methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1352458511421918">
<title>Patients and study protocol</title>
<p>Forty consecutive individuals with MS treated at the MS clinic of the Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel, meeting the inclusion criteria and ready to participate in the study were recruited during visits to the clinic. The inclusion criteria were: MS definite diagnosis according to McDonald,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511421918">11</xref></sup> relapsing–remitting type, Hebrew speaking and over age 18. Exclusion criteria were any additional disease other than MS and any cognitive impairment. During the recruitment participants were alternately allocated to one of two groups of 20 patients each: the telemed group and the control group. The study included two stages: A and B. During the first 6 months (stage A) demographic data were collected and values were obtained for: disease duration, use of disease modulating drug (DMD) and disease-related disability, assessed by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511421918">12</xref></sup>). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the multiple sclerosis quality of life (MSQoL54) questionnaire,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511421918">13</xref></sup> and assessment of daily living activities (ADL) was obtained using the Barthel score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511421918">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the second stage (stage B), which consisted of the following 6 months, the teleconference program was implemented among the telemed group participants. Patients were connected via home telecare technology (see details below) to a call center, which supplied medical information, answers to patients’ specific questions, and support on issues concerning the disease. Patients continued to receive standard treatment at the clinic. The duration of the teleconference program was limited to 6 months due to funding constraints. Individuals in the control group received standard treatment at the clinic without being connected to a call center.</p>
<p>Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects in accordance with Helsinki guidelines. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511421918">Figure 1</xref> shows a flowchart of the study participants.</p>

<sec id="section4-1352458511421918">
<title>Clinical outcome measures</title>
<p>Clinical outcomes were assessed by: 1) the number of relapses in each of the study stages. Relapse was defined as the occurrence of an acute episode of one or more new symptoms, or worsening of existing symptoms of MS, not associated with fever or infection, and lasting for at least 24 h, after a stable period of at least 30 days. Only relapses that were associated with significant functional deterioration and that required corticosteroid treatment were included in the study. The data on relapses were collected from the Clalit Health Services (CHS; the largest Health Maintenance Organization-HMO in Israel) database and from the MS clinic; 2) changes in disability scores (EDSS) determined by an independent and experienced neurologist during participants’ visits to the clinic at the end of the study in comparison to baseline;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511421918">12</xref></sup> and 3) changes in the severity of MS symptoms as described by the patients at the end of the study in comparison to baseline. Ten types of symptoms were considered: visual abnormalities, memory impairment, foot weakness, hand dysfunction, walking impairment, imbalance, muscle cramps/pain, dysesthesia, urinary or stool incontinence, and fatigue. Patients’ grading of the severity of each symptom was noted on a scale of 1–4, where 1 = no complaint, 2 = minor disturbances, 3 = moderate disturbances, and 4 = severe disturbances. The data were collected via telephone interviews conducted every other month during the study by an independent investigator using a structured questionnaire designed with closed-ended questions with a set of responses from which the respondent was to indicate his/her choice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1352458511421918">
<title>Patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL)</title>
<p>Patients’ subjective health assessments were measured using the MS HRQoL questionnaire (MSQoL54).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511421918">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511421918">15</xref></sup> This questionnaire combines the 54 questions of the MS quality of life using 14 different categories (according to RAND 36-item health survey)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511421918">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511421918">17</xref></sup> with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), which encompasses nine questions scored on a different scale according to FACIT (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511421918">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511421918">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>MSQoL category scores were computed by averaging the items belonging to each category. The resultant raw category scores were linearly transformed onto a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better QoL and less fatigability. The percentage of change in each category from baseline to the end of the study was also calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1352458511421918">
<title>Satisfaction regarding the operation of the call center and telecare modality</title>
<p>Among the patients in the telemed group, satisfaction with the treatment modality was measured via phone interviews conducted by an independent investigator (based on Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set-HEDIS 3.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511421918">20</xref></sup>) after the 6 months of telecare implementation. The interview consisted of six questions regarding satisfaction with the call center, each question scaled differently.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1352458511421918">
<title>Medical costs</title>
<p>Medical costs were assessed by an analysis of costs associated with emergency room admissions, hospitalizations and visits to outpatient clinics during the first stage of the study compared with the second stage, using the CHS computerized database. Notably, the program was based on an available 24 h telephone-based call center operated by nurses of the HMO, for which upgrading to a videoconference-based service (detailed below) was associated with minor costs, according to the limited budget available for the project. Of note, the cost analysis was based on patient-centered medical expenses and did not include the costs associated with the telemed program. The telemed service was based on an existing HMO’s telephone call center, which was upgraded to a teleconferencing call center for the MS patients. Equipment (cameras, etc.) costs were minimal and not included in the calculation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1352458511421918">
<title>Sample size</title>
<p>The sample size of 20 patients in the telemed group and 20 patients in the control group enables the detection of a difference of about 1 SD, with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05, in comparisons of outcomes such as symptom severity, HRQoL and health-related costs between the two independent groups. Within each group, a difference of less than 1 SD (medium to high effect) can be detected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1352458511421918">
<title>Call center and mode of operation</title>
<p>Videoconference meetings were conducted by experienced registered nurses, members of the CHS call center personnel. The call center is operated 24 h a day, 7 days a week by an experienced team of nurses trained in health telecounseling who underwent special training to enable them to provide a ‘safety net’ for callers, as described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511421918">21</xref></sup> In addition, nurses involved in this project participated in a specially designed course about MS, in which they received particular training regarding the response protocol appropriate for the study. The call center team was able to answer questions related to symptoms of MS, emergency consultations if a relapse was suspected, DMD-related side effects and steroids-related side effects. Whenever necessary, they could immediately reach the medical personnel on duty at the MS clinic.</p>
<p>Each patient had a credit line of 30 min per week (or 2.5 h per month) of free-of-charge calls to the call center through a toll-free number. In order to encourage patients to focus their interactions with the call center, and avoid excessive use of the team’s time, calls beyond this time were charged at standard rates. Patient – call center interactions included prescheduled weekly meetings; unscheduled meetings initiated by the patient in case of any kind of emergency; and a call center-initiated meeting if a patient forgot or made no contact for a week.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1352458511421918">
<title>Technology and equipment</title>
<p>The system at the patients’ homes consisted of a standard videoconferencing camera and the home TV monitor, which were connected to the call center through regular telephone lines - Plain Old Telephone System (POTS). The above equipment was selected to ensure reduced costs and ease of use from the patient’s perspective. Equipment at the call center included a multi-line videoconferencing system and computerized medical files, as well as an MS-specific database file, which included patients’ demographic, clinical, and laboratory information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1352458511421918">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was performed using the SPSS 15 statistical package (SPSS, Chicago, IL).</p>
<p>The association between the study groups (telemed group and control group) with gender and treatment with DMD (Interferon beta or Copaxone) was examined using the Fisher exact test due to the small sample.</p>
<p>Comparisons of continuous variables such as age, disease duration, EDSS, ADL, symptom severity score and HRQoL between the two groups were performed using <italic>t</italic>-test or Mann–Whitney test, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Paired <italic>t</italic>-test or Wilcoxon test was employed to analyze the changes in EDSS and in the number of relapses at baseline and at the end of the study period in each of the groups.</p>
<p>Comparison of the proportion of relapse-free patients in each group over time was done using the McNemar test.</p>
<p>All <italic>p</italic> values were two-sided, and statistical significance was defined as <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section13-1352458511421918">
<title>Patients’ characteristics</title>
<p>Thirty-four of the 40 patients (85%) recruited were women, age ranged from 18 to 61 years (mean = 43.8 ± 11.5) and ADL ranged from 22 to 100 (mean = 88.4 ± 18.7) with no significant difference between the two groups. Of the 20 participants assigned to the telemed group, one did not manage to connect to the telecare system. There was no significant difference between the telemed group and the control group in disease duration in years (mean = 7.9 ± 6.6, range [1, 26] vs. mean = 5.7 ± 3.7, range [1, 14] respectively) or in the percentage of patients taking DMD (90% vs. 85%, respectively). Notably, the high percentage of treated patients is representative of Israeli Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients and is due to the Israeli national health insurance law, according to which patients are eligible to receive MS medications free. Baseline mean EDSS was higher in the telemed group: 5.1 ± 0.9 vs. 3.9 ± 1.4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1352458511421918">
<title>Clinical outcomes</title>
<p>There was a significant increase in EDSS in both the telemed and the control groups. A comparison of the telemed and control groups’ pre- and post-study EDSS indicates that there was a lower deterioration of disability among the telemed group patients, compared with the control group (0.24 ± 0.30 vs. 0.70 ± 0.47, respectively). However, since a 6 month period of follow-up (which was determined and restricted by the limited funding available for the study) is, without doubt, too short a period to indicate significance in disability progression in MS, the smaller increase in the mean EDSS scores in the telemedicine group over this period should be confirmed in studies with longer periods of follow-up.</p>
<p>In both groups there was a decrease in the number of relapses and an increase in the number of relapse-free patients, but these were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511421918">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The severity of the main MS-related symptoms as described by the patients at baseline and following the telecare implementation period was compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458511421918">Figure 3A</xref>). The telemed group related improvement in six (of ten) symptoms and a very slight deterioration in one symptom, while the control group related improvement in fewer symptoms and deterioration in five items. For statistical analysis a single total score of symptom severity was calculated for each group at the beginning and at the end of the study, based on the severity of all ten symptoms together. The median severity scores of the telemed and control groups at the beginning of the study were 2.8 and 2.4 respectively, and at the last phone interview at the end of the study they were 2.6 and 2.5 respectively.

<title>Satisfaction regarding the operation of the call center and telecare modality</title>
<p>Patients’ answers indicate that the experience of being followed up by telecare modality was positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1352458511421918">Figure 5</xref>). Fewer than 10% of patients gave a poor evaluation of the system on any of the questions. All participants indicated their willingness to use the same modality, as is or after improvements, and the majority would recommend the system to others. Patients’ answers indicate the need to improve the communication technology itself and to address the problem of some delays in the call center’s responses.</p>

<title>Medical costs</title>
<p>Data on medical costs were available for 18 patients in each group. There was a significant decrease in the medical costs (in Israeli Shekels) for the telemed group from stage A to stage B (median = 1634, range 122 to 58,789 vs. median = 835, range 74 to 29,318, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.039).</p>
<p>In the control group, costs increased from median = 896.50, range from 150 to 18,596, to median = 935, range from 256 to 7984, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05. There was no statistically significant difference between the costs of the two groups during stage A.</p>
<p>In order to assess the percentage of the change in costs for patients in each group, we calculated the percentage of patients who presented a decrease in costs higher than the median of the percentage of change (−35%). Sixty-seven percent of the patients in the telemed group and 33% of the control group had a decrease in costs of more than 35% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.046).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to assess the effects of telecare for MS patients on clinical outcome, health care-related costs, HRQoL, and satisfaction. These perspectives were selected based on the dimensions appraised by the Health Value Compass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511421918">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results obtained indicate that telecare may benefit the clinical outcome of MS patients, as demonstrated by the decrease in symptom severity in the telemed group compared with the control group, and can reduce medical costs. Although 6 months is a short follow-up period to assess changes in EDSS, the trend of lower increase in EDSS in the telemed group can at least indicate that telecare seems not to present potential harm to participants, who theoretically could have neglected medical visits due to the teleservice.</p>
<p>Regarding HRQoL, patients in the telemed group reported improvement in more categories and in higher percentages than patients in the control group. Although this difference was not statistically significant, it seems to indicate that telecare contributed to patients’ well-being. This result is of value, since patients’ reported HRQoL is considered an important parameter in disease management and a criterion for treatment success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511421918">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although, in the current study, both patient groups were a priori accustomed to substantial support, which included an experienced and easily accessible team at the MS clinic and ongoing aid delivered through the drug companies’ support system of trained nurses, and many of these patients also participated in patient support groups, the availability of a 24 h /7 days a week teleconference system was expected to provide an additional dimension to patient support. The fact that all participants in the telemed group reported satisfaction and willingness to use this modality seems to indicate that it does indeed offer an added value of support. The improvement in the severity of patients’ symptoms and the apparent improvement in HRQoL reinforce the assumption that this modality seems to be associated with promoting patients’ well-being.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a secondary advantage of the telecare system was identified: patients linked to the call center used the modality to create and maintain a ‘patients’ network,’ which they described as beneficial in terms of both the social interaction and the boost in morale that accompanied these occasions.</p>
<p>Despite the availability of MS medications free of charge, adherence to treatment represents a challenge in Israel as in other countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511421918">23</xref></sup> Improvement in patient well-being and availability of a networked support group could contribute to patient participation in health care and therefore contribute to adherence. Further studies to evaluate the effect of telecare on patients’ adherence to treatment and comparison of our findings with findings in other countries, where different Medicare and support systems are available, would be of much interest.</p>
<p>In terms of the interaction between patients and the call center team, several observations are noteworthy. The home telecare service was operated by a subgroup of the call center team, which, although specially trained in the various aspects of MS, could not achieve the same level of expertise as the medical team at the MS clinic, and were not expected to replace them. In spite of the preparation of the patients for realistic expectations from the team, nurses often found themselves embarrassed by patients’ curious questions related to new developments in the MS field. The call center personnel should be updated regarding recent MS-related developments, such as the availability of state-of-the-art treatments. Another important point to be taken into consideration is that both nurses and patients reported that, in the case of a relapse which, following the decision of the physician at the MS center, required adequate corticosteroid treatment, the call center personnel were not always updated about the patient’s clinical status. Therefore, a key aspect for successful implementation of telecare seems to be ongoing communication and update of all teams involved. Another efficiency-related improvement would be to appoint for each patient a particular nurse at the call center to be his/her main telecare provider. This would facilitate interaction, improve the flow of information, and contribute to the modality’s supportive role.</p>
<p>The usage of telecare in this study had a significant effect on the medical costs assessed, with 67% of the patients in the telemed group presenting a decrease of more than one-third in the costs. Although the costs associated with telecare implementation were not studied, the acquisition of camera and video equipment and the use of standard phone lines represented a relatively modest initial investment in the present study, which was based on an available 24 h operating call center, upgraded to videoconference-based service for the duration of the study.</p>
<p>Clearly, cost-effectiveness evaluation should also include the costs of providing the program. However, the decreasing costs of telecommunications and information technologies, while health care costs are rising, indicate that telecare may contribute to reduced medical costs even if higher investments in technology are needed. Future studies with a larger number of participants should take into consideration not only the medical costs but also costs related to the implementation of the telemed service.</p>
<p>The occasional problems with the cameras, the picture resolution, the quality of voice, and disruptions in the communication due to noise indicate that the effect of this modality would most likely increase with the implementation of more advanced technologies.</p>
<p>Whether implementation of home telecare should be broadened, and considered as a worthwhile and advisable modality for patients’ care, would require extended studies. Future studies should engage in a more lengthy intervention period, include larger patient groups, assess costs both in technology and in medical care, and take into account the several dimensions of benefit through cost–benefit analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511421918">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among the seeming implications of telemed is its application as part of patient-centered approaches and <italic>participatory medicine</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511421918">24</xref></sup> which carries the potential of increased adherence to medical treatments, though this too is yet to be verified in future studies.</p>
<p>The effects of the modality should be assessed for distinct MS population groups, varying according to disease duration, degree of disability, and disease type. It has to be taken into consideration that in Israel, due to its geographic size, most of the population lives at a reasonable distance from medical centers, and therefore the role of telemedicine may be different compared with that in other countries, where limited accessibility to specialized medical services and substantial geographical distance from medical centers are common problems.</p>
<p>An additional finding of this study was that the Health Value Compass, allowing a comprehensive and multifaceted analysis including clinical outcomes, functional status, patient satisfaction, and related costs, was found to be a beneficial measurement tool for guiding health care data collection, the integration of which allows assessment of implementation of new healthcare services, such as telemedicine.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study indicates that telecare can contribute to the clinical outcome of MS patients and to a decrease in medical costs. Among the novelties of our study is the application of the Health Value Compass as a model for assessment of composite outcomes, which have become increasingly common in the medical literature, as a model for evaluation of changes in a panorama of health-related processes in individuals with MS, while implementing a new approach using telemedicine where, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been used before. Future studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings and determine whether telemedicine is specifically beneficial to patients who suffer from functional disability and reduced accessibility to medical care and support.</p>
