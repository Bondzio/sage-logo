In the present study, APOTs in 3 cats were characterized by immunohistochemistry, and the amyloid components analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry. Antiameloblastin antibodies labeled both neoplastic epithelial cells and amyloid in all cases. Neoplastic epithelial cells had strong, diffuse immunoreactivity to antibodies against cytokeratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 14, and cytokeratin 19 in all cases and focal immunoreactivity to nerve growth factor receptor antibodies in 2 of 3 cases. Amyloid and some tumor stromal cells were weakly positive for laminin. Calretinin, amelogenin, S100, and glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies did not label neoplastic epithelial cells or amyloid. Extracted amyloid peptide sequences were compared to the porcine database because the cat genome is not yet complete. Based on this comparison, 1 identical ameloblastin peptide was detected in each tumor. These results suggest that feline APOTs and the amyloid they produce are of ameloblastic lineage.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ameloblasts</kwd><kwd>ameloblastin</kwd><kwd>amyloid</kwd><kwd>amyloid-producing odontogenic tumor</kwd><kwd>cats</kwd><kwd>immunohistochemistry</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>odontogenic tumor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumors (CEOT) in humans and similar neoplasms in dogs and cats, now classified as amyloid-producing odontogenic tumors (APOTs), are uncommon odontogenic neoplasms with poorly understood histogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985812452583">5</xref></sup> The salient feature of both entities is the production of amyloid of uncertain origin.

Ameloblastin, formerly known as sheathlin, is an enamel matrix protein produced by ameloblasts during the secretory stage through the early maturation stage of amelogenesis, and it is critical for maintaining the ameloblast differentiation state and enamel formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812452583">4</xref> </sup>It is a tooth-specific glycoprotein, localized near the ameloblast cell surface, in contrast to the other important enamel protein, amelogenin, which is expressed throughout the enamel layer but not around the cell surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812452583">4</xref></sup></p><p>The presence of an ameloblastin peptide in these feline APOTs is consistent with the finding of a similar enamel protein in an APOT from a Shih Tzu dog, in which the amyloid, analyzed via SDS-PAGE, was composed of an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal amino acid sequence similar to both rat ameloblastin and porcine sheathlin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812452583">6</xref> </sup>In that study, the APOTs from the Shih Tzu and 8 other dogs, as well as developing teeth from 3 canine fetuses, were characterized immunohistochemically. Neoplastic epithelial cells and amyloid from the canine APOTs, as well as the immature enamel matrix and ameloblast cytoplasm from the canine fetal teeth, all were immunoreactive to rat ameloblastin, porcine amelogenin and sheathlin, and an anticanine APOT amyloid-specific polyclonal antibody developed for the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812452583">6</xref></sup> The neoplastic cells were also positive for CK AE1/AE3, CK9, and CK14.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812452583">6</xref></sup></p><p>The neoplastic epithelium of the feline APOTs in this study was immunoreactive to some epithelial-specific antibodies, including CK AE1/AE3, CK14, and CK19, in addition to human ameloblastin. However, neither the amyloid nor the neoplastic epithelium of the feline APOTS had immunoreactivity for amelogenin. Amelogenin is also secreted by ameloblasts during early stages of amelogenesis but in different quantities than ameloblastin both spatially and temporally. Amelogenin constitutes more than 90% of the developing enamel matrix and is considered important for maintenance of the root surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812452583">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, ameloblastin may indirectly regulate the expression of amelogenin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812452583">4</xref></sup> Immunoreactivity to amelogenin antibodies has been reported in several cell types of developing teeth (ameloblasts, odontoblasts, and cementoblasts).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812452583">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985812452583">9</xref></sup> The lack of immunoreactivity to amelogenin in the tumors in this study may signify a species difference or technical issue with the antibody. However, APOT neoplastic cells could represent ameloblasts at various stages of amelogenesis because the expression of amelogenin depends on the differentiation stage of ameloblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985812452583">9</xref></sup></p><p>Calretinin was proposed as a potential marker of odontogenic epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985812452583">9</xref></sup> but was not expressed by any tumor or overlying epithelial cells in the current study.

This finding further supports the hypothesis that the neoplastic epithelium of APOTs is of ameloblastic origin. However, NGFR immunoreactivity indicates variation among tumors and that some neoplastic cells may represent ameloblasts in an earlier stage of differentiation (eg, IEE and preameloblast).</p><p>In this study, tumor amyloid and some adjacent stromal cells were labeled with laminin antibodies, as in another feline APOT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812452583">1</xref></sup> Laminins, along with type IV collagen and integrin-α<sub>6</sub>, are in the dental basement membrane and matrix during early tooth development, including the presecretory stage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812452583">4</xref> </sup>Thus, the presence of laminins in the amyloid of odontogenic tumors suggests that their histogenesis is linked to ameloblast differentiation and, in some tumors, during the early stages of amelogenesis.</p><p>CK14 and CK19 are type 1 intermediate filaments of epithelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985812452583">2</xref> </sup>Though CK14 is the main intermediate filament of odontogenic epithelium, it is not specific and, along with CK19, is also expressed in inner and outer enamel epithelium, cells from the stellate reticulum, stratum intermedium, the dental lamina, and Serres rests of the developing tooth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985812452583">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985812452583">9</xref></sup></p><p>In summary, these results indicate that ameloblasts give rise to APOTs and produce the tumor amyloid.

Immunohistochemical findings provided evidence for the presence of neoplastic ameloblasts in both secretory and presecretory stages, which suggests that APOT histogenesis is closely related to amelogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Renee Walker and the histology staff of the University of Illinois Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Sallie Macy of the University of Tennessee Human Immunology and Cancer Research Program, and Marlene van Heerden of the University of Pretoria Department of Oral Pathology and Oral Biology for excellent technical assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-0300985812452583"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-0300985812452583"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0300985812452583"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bock</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Hach</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Baumgärtner</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group>. <article-title>Oral masses in two cats</article-title>. <source>Vet Pathol</source>. <year>2011</year>;<volume>48</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>906</fpage>–<lpage>910</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-0300985812452583"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Domingues</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Jaeger</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Araujo</surname><given-names>VC</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>. <article-title>Expression of cytokeratins in human enamel organ</article-title>. <source>Eur J Oral Sci</source>. <year>2000</year>;<volume>108</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>43</fpage>–<lpage>47</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr3-0300985812452583"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Donnell</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name><name><surname>Eulitz</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>. <article-title>Odontogenic feline and canine tumor-associated amyloid is formed from ameloblastin</article-title>.
