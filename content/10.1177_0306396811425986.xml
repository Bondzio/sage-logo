<abstract>
<p>Names carry strong ethnic and religious connotations and reveal an individual’s affiliation to a specific group. When a religious or ethnic group is stigmatised, the relationship between names and social stigma becomes explicit. For Muslims, names and veils are the two most conspicuous signifiers of their stigmatised identity. Some believe that covering their Muslim identity with Swedish-sounding or ‘neutral’ European names will facilitate their individual integration into society. Based on empirical findings, examining application forms for name-changing and interviews with name-changers, this article offers an exploratory analysis of the reasons, expectations and effects of surname-changing among immigrants with Muslim names. It examines the extent to which the changes reflect the impact of social disadvantage and anti-Muslim sentiment in Sweden.</p>

<body>
<p>Names, as we are all aware, can carry strong ethnic and religious connotations and may reveal an individual’s affiliation to a specific group. The subject of my study is what lies behind name-changing among immigrants with Muslim names in Sweden. Following a quantitative survey on the consequences of name-changing among immigrants conducted by Arai and Skogman Thoursie, this qualitative study looks at the causes, expectations and experiences of immigrants with Muslim surnames who changed their names. Arai and Skogman Thoursie, whose study examined the effects on earnings when immigrants from Asian, African and Slavic countries changed their surnames to Swedish-sounding or neutral ones, argued that there was, indeed, a substantial increase in annual earnings after such a change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306396811425986">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Names express then, as well as constitute, social relations. Moreover, surnames are about inheritance and rights. As markers of privilege, surnames have a commodity-like value. The exchange value of surnames is shown in the proportional relationship between name-changing and wage levels among low-income immigrants in Sweden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306396811425986">2</xref></sup> Since proper names bring privileges, they are protected. In many societies, different social categories have had their own lexicons of names, and using cross-class, -caste or -race names has been forbidden. The Swedish law of naming states that the requirement for an individual who wishes to change their name to an existing Swedish surname is that he or she has to be a direct descendant of someone who has borne that name for at least two generations within the last 100 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306396811425986">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>When a religious or ethnic group is stigmatised, the relationship between names and social stigma becomes explicit. Name-changing thus becomes a strategy to cope with and manage stigmatisation and discrimination. To change one’s name to a Swedish-sounding one can be a strategy for ‘covering’ or ‘passing’. The narratives of name-changers not only describe Muslim immigrants’ individual exclusion and segregation, they also tell us about the deeply embedded anti-Muslim prejudice in different sectors of Swedish society. The results of studying name-changing among immigrants with Muslim names illustrate how immigrants experience and cope with this. How do those who change their names make a case for the practice themselves? What are their expectations when they change their names? What experiences result from assuming a new name?</p>
<sec id="section1-0306396811425986" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This analysis was developed, as has been indicated, from a large quantitative study carried out into the changing of surnames in the 1990s from ‘foreign-sounding’ surnames to ‘Swedish/neutral’-sounding surnames.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306396811425986">4</xref></sup> Among the main sources of data used in this study were 1,165 application forms for name changes submitted to <italic>Patent-och registreringsverket</italic> (the Swedish Patent and Registration Office). The application forms were divided into four main categories: Asian/African (mostly names from the Middle East and North Africa, 504 forms); Slavic names (454 forms); Finnish names (155 forms); and, Latin names (52 forms). The clear relation between name-changing and income level evidenced in the quantitative study raised additional questions which could best be answered by qualitative research. The main focus here is on the question on the form that asked about the reason for, and motivation behind, the requested change of name.</p>
<p>From 1,165 applications, 488 submitted by those with Muslim-sounding surnames were selected, essentially Arabic names associated with Islam. In most cases, the association was made explicit by those applying to change their name themselves. The forms contained useful and interesting information about the reasons and motivations for name-changing. While some applicants gave a single, short reason, others wrote long and varied explanations. In many cases, the applicants used the back of the form, and some attached additional sheets of paper, to explain their decisions. Additionally, forty-five people (nineteen women and twenty-six men) out of the 488 were randomly selected for structured interviews, which were conducted in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306396811425986">5</xref></sup> The interview questions focused on the motives, expectations and experiences of the individuals who had changed their Muslim surnames. How and why did they get the idea of changing their surnames? What were the reactions of friends and relatives? What experiences had they had when known by their old name? Did their experiences with their new names meet their expectations?</p>
<p>The decision of immigrants in Sweden to change their Muslim-sounding surnames is related to the social and economic context. One crucial feature to emerge was the all-pervasiveness of anti-Muslim sentiment in Swedish society.</p>

<title>Anti-Muslim sentiment in Sweden</title>
<p>Apart from the immigration of ‘guest workers’ from Turkey, starting in the late 1960s, the majority of immigrants of Muslim background came as asylum seekers or for family reunification from the early 1980s. The size of the Muslim population in Sweden increased from approximately 100,000 at the end of the 1980s to around 200,000 by the mid-1990s, and to approximately 350,000 by the early 2000s. Just over 85 per cent of Sweden’s Muslim population arrived in Sweden after 1985.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306396811425986">6</xref></sup> Since recording personal information, such as religious affiliation, is not allowed in Sweden, all statistics on the Muslim population in Sweden are estimated on the basis of the national background of immigrants. The main Muslim countries from which immigrants have come are Iran (57,663), Iraq (109,446), Turkey (39,230) and Afghanistan (11,446).</p>
<p>As in the rest of Europe, anti-Muslim prejudice has drastically increased over the past decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306396811425986">7</xref></sup> Anti-Muslim political propaganda, started by the rightwing populist party Ny Demokrati (New Democracy) in the early 1990s, has been growing throughout the 1990s and 2000s. An indication of its strength is the increasing popularity of the ultra-rightwing Sverigedemokraterna (Sweden Democrats), which had, until 2007, been a marginal and largely invisible political organisation. In the 2010 general election, having gained 5.7 per cent of the votes, the party crossed the 4 per cent threshold necessary for parliamentary representation and became a visible and active anti-immigrant actor in Swedish public debate.</p>
<p>Many political analysts attribute the sudden popularity of the party to its frank anti-Muslim rhetoric, which was explicitly expressed in the party’s election campaign film. The film shows two people pouring money into two piles, one labelled ‘pensions’ and the other ‘immigration’. An elderly ‘Swedish’ woman using a walking frame and a group of burka-clad women pushing a pram are in a race to a counter. The voiceover says: ‘Now you have a choice. You can choose the pension brake or the immigration brake.’ This rather confusingly presented film is nonetheless clear in that it draws on the idea that the presence of Muslims is a threat to Sweden’s wellbeing. The threat is underlined by the reference to the danger inherent in the reproduction of an undesirable group – the pram pushed by the burka-clad women.</p>
<p>Islam and Muslims are not only represented as threats to Swedish norms and values, including gender equality and freedom of speech, but are also represented as a threat to the very existence of the nation. In October 2009, Jimmie Åkesson, leader of Sweden Democrats, declared in an article in <italic>Aftonbladet</italic> (one of the main tabloids) that Islam and Muslims were the greatest threat to Sweden since the second world war.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306396811425986">8</xref></sup> Subjects such as the hijab (veil), the building of mosques, male and female circumcision, arranged marriages, honour killings and growing radical Islamism in the suburbs have been recurrent themes in public debates which render Muslims a visible problem, while they remain invisible socially.</p>
<p>Muslims in Sweden face antagonism not only from violent racists in everyday life, but also from intellectual elites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306396811425986">9</xref></sup> Through a complex process, involving the mass media, popular culture and academic writing, anti-Muslim rhetoric and sentiments have been naturalised so that they now form part of a dominant consensus that includes organisations such as that of Ex-Muslims (also established in several other European countries, including the Netherlands and the UK), which emerged in the early 2000s, and the Swedish Humanist Association (Humanisterna).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306396811425986">10</xref></sup> Moreover, there are academic works that represent Muslims as <italic>unwilling</italic> and <italic>unable</italic> to integrate on the basis that Muslim immigrants supposedly follow a different integration pattern from other immigrants. According to one biased survey, Muslim immigrants are unintegratable, regardless of length of stay, level of income, education or other qualifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306396811425986">11</xref></sup> Such a view reduces the problems of segregation and exclusion to one single issue; namely, Islam. Such a reductionist approach has contributed to what has been referred to as the racial formation of Muslims.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306396811425986">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Muslims are represented as having characteristics that are immutable, innate, inevitable in their heritability and, importantly, essentially inferior, their religious identity becomes ‘racialised’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306396811425986">13</xref></sup> Anti-Muslim sentiment is more about racism than about religious intolerance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306396811425986">14</xref></sup> Accordingly, Muslim identity has become a ‘discrediting’ stigma by means of which Muslims are subjected to suspicion, disbelief and mistrust. As one of our respondents noted: ‘With my new name, I am not questioned (<italic>ifrågasätts</italic>) like before. Now people believe what I say. I have more credibility now’ (Iraq-born male). Mahmood Mamdani argues that: ‘while bad Muslims are seen as responsible for terrorism … good Muslims are anxious to clear their names and take distance from political Islam’, based on the assumption that unless proven to be ‘good’, every Muslim is presumed to be ‘bad’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306396811425986">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, anti-Muslim sentiment is highly gendered. While Muslim women are targeted in relation to their gender and sexuality, Muslim men are targeted in relation to their religion and ethnicity. Muslim men are represented in terms of women’s oppression, radical Islamism, terrorism and ‘primitive masculinity’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306396811425986">16</xref></sup> The converse stereotype of the Muslim man as oppressor is that of the passive Muslim woman, a victim in need of saving. Interestingly, a quantitative study showed that men with Muslim names were subject to stronger negative preconceptions from Swedish employers than women with Muslim names.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306396811425986">17</xref></sup> However, both Muslim men and women were seen not as foreigners, but as deviants – women by virtue of their veils and men by virtue of their names. It is via names and veils that Muslims are immediately identified, assigned their ‘inferiority’ and exposed to discrimination. The issue of banning the hijab, and particularly the burka, has been hotly debated in Sweden in recent years. Whether a Muslim woman’s body is covered or uncovered has become a battlefield in both public discourse and everyday life. The other signifier of Muslim identity – the name – is less visible than the veil, though still a forceful device for stigmatisation. Muslim names ‘signifying an “Arab/Middle Eastern/Muslim” identity rendered particular men and boys at once foreign, or alien, to the nation, but at the same time connected, in the most familial and instinctive terms, to “the terrorist”’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306396811425986">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>How names can be used to discriminate is revealed in the special register of Muslim names maintained in Sweden since September 11 2001, which has caused difficulties for many Muslims who have tried to transfer money and found that their bank accounts have been blocked:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306396811425986">19</xref></sup> ‘With a new name, it is easier to find a job. It makes my life easy in Sweden and it is easier to travel in this time of terrorists’ (Middle East-born male). Muslim names designate not individuals, but a type: ‘My name is Akbar; people call me “Allah Akbar” [God is great!]’ (Middle East-born male). Likewise, the name Muhammad has become a brand to designate ‘Muslim’. The name Muhammad (and its different versions, Mohammad, Mehmet, Mehmed and Mohand, depending on country and region), derived from Arabic and the name of the prophet, is a popular boy’s name among Muslims. Muhammad is regarded as ‘typically’ Muslim. Equating Muslims with the name Muhammad has its roots in medieval Europe, when Muslims were called Mohammedans, a term from the thirteenth century, based on a belief among Christians that Muslims worshipped Muhammad.</p>
<p>Political controversies, such as the Muhammad cartoons published in Denmark in 2005 and the Muhammad drawings by Lars Viks (who depicted the prophet Muhammad as a dog) in Sweden in 2009, have helped to conflate Muhammad with Muslim. A Swedish man told me that once, when he was in an airport, a ‘Muslim-looking’ crowd was gathered in front of the departure gate. They were ‘noisy’ and he could not get through them. So he shouted ‘Muhammad’, and suddenly everyone looked round and became silent, so he got through to the gate. Muhammad has become a name to designate a person who is not socially and culturally connected to Swedishness. In the Flashback forum of Sweden’s largest online buy-and-sell website Blocket.se, an interesting discussion on Muslim names and trust took place between July and August 2007. One comment stated that: ‘The names in the ads are often a typical Swedish name, but when you call it, it is a Muhammad who answers.’ One general and recurring comment was: ‘I never buy things from a Muhammad. The things he sells are probably stolen goods.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306396811425986">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, Muslims are turned into <italic>a</italic> Muhammad. Like the Cohen regularly featured in anti-Semitic jokes and songs, the name Muhammad also often figures in jokes about Muslims.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306396811425986">21</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, the desire to escape that name is high among those who carry the surname Muhammad. While only 0.7 per cent of immigrants born in Africa or Asia actually carried the surname Muhammad in Sweden, applications to change from the surname Muhammad accounted for almost 9 per cent of requests from all individuals born in Africa or Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306396811425986">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some people felt that Muslim names acted as a barrier during the ritual of introducing themselves in everyday social interactions. Receiving ‘better treatment’ from Swedes after changing their names was a recurring point made during interviews, thereby revealing that participants’ former Muslim names were considered the main reason for being badly treated. One way of coping, therefore, is ‘to keep the stigma from looming large’ and downplaying one’s Muslim identity, so as to be accepted as a ‘good’ immigrant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306396811425986">23</xref></sup></p>

<title>Reasons for name-changing</title>
<p>Immigrants change their surnames for a variety of reasons. It might signify a wish to assimilate or it can be a way to reconstruct and reinforce one’s ethnic identity. The most frequently recurring reasons mentioned on the 488 application forms in this study are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306396811425986">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The applicants usually cited more than one reason on their application forms. For instance, difficulty of pronunciation was mentioned, along with discrimination, or the wish to dissociate from Islam was often followed with a wish for Europeanisation of the name. The last three factors listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306396811425986">Figure 1</xref>, political reasons (e.g. refugees who feared persecution from their homeland states), divorce, and religious and ethnic motivations (e.g. Kurds who wanted to change their imposed Turkish surnames into Kurdish ones), made up only 13 per cent of all the reasons stated. The rest were all related directly or indirectly to the host society. Experience of discrimination was mentioned in eighty-five applications, and anticipation of discrimination was mentioned in thirty-seven. Altogether, discrimination accounted for 20 per cent of all reasons for applying to change one’s name: ‘I had sought 150 jobs and only once was called for an interview … After changing my name, I sought eleven jobs and was called for interview six times and was offered three jobs’ (Lebanese-born male).</p>
<p>Muslim and Arabic names have been identified as one of the main hindrances to employment and career progression in Sweden. In a study on discrimination in hiring in Sweden, applications that showed candidates as having identical skills were randomly assigned Middle Eastern or Swedish-sounding names. Applications bearing Swedish names resulted in 50 per cent more invitations for interview than those that went under Arabic or Middle Eastern names.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306396811425986">24</xref></sup> In some cases, name-changing had been actively encouraged to enhance employment prospects:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It was a suggestion I got from the employment office. (Turkish-born female)</p>
<p>My chief for the company in which I was doing practical training gave me a tip to change my name. (Iranian-born male)</p>
<p>In a job interview, when I mentioned I had decided to change my surname, they [the employers] became glad and I got the job. (Iranian-born female)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Discrimination against job applicants with Muslim names has also been studied in other European countries. For instance, a survey in France revealed that applicants with Muslim names were 2.5 times less likely to be called for a job interview than applicants with names of Christian origin. It also showed that the average monthly income for Muslims was €400 lower than for those with ‘Christian’ names.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306396811425986">25</xref></sup> A correlation between Muslim names and discrimination is also documented in the housing market. A report from 2007 showed that a man with an Arabic/Muslim name had four times less chance of being offered housing than a man with a Swedish name.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306396811425986">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Here are just some of the ways in which applicants expressed their experience of discrimination:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I have bad experiences from my old name. I was discriminated against and insulted by all … Before, people wanted to know where I am from, but with the new name, I do not feel humiliated anymore. (Middle East-born male)</p>
<p>[I changed my name] to evade all negative reactions. There was a distance I was forced to bridge … Now people are curious in a positive way and ask in a positive way where the name comes from. Before, few dared to ask. It was more like a silence [around me]. (Iraq-born male)</p>
<p>I think my name was good. It was circumstances that made us [applicant and his family] think about changing our name. We realised that our name had negative connotations. It was the Iraq crisis, Baghdad and that. The atmosphere in the world was negative towards all Arab-related things. (Iraq-born male)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Saving the children from discrimination is also a reason for changing a family’s name and was mentioned on thirty-seven forms:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I changed my name first of all for my children. (Bangladesh-born male with Islam in his name)</p>
<p>My children will not suffer. They maybe get it easier with the new name. (Iraq-born male)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One oft-cited reason (indeed, the most recurrent) mentioned on the application forms was the difficulty of pronunciation or mispronunciation of applicants’ original names:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Before, when, for example, I was in a waiting room [in a clinic], I rushed up before they would call my name. I knew they would pronounce it wrong and strangely. (Iraq-born male)</p>
<p>My name was difficult to pronounce and it made it hard to find a job. A Swedish-sounding name would open the doors for me. (Turkish-born female)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>And sometimes names were changed to make it easier for the majority society to pronounce them. Some applicants expressed this point explicitly:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It was a demand by society. (Iranian-born female)</p>
<p>It was a part of the Swedishisation process we are forced to go through. (Iraq-born male)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The ‘suggestions’ and recommendations offered to Muslims today to change their names are in fact asking them to cover up and/or tone down their religious affiliation or ethnicity if they want to be tolerated. A consequence of the alleged ‘non-pronounceability’ of certain names is the sense that the bearers of those names become socially invisible. Two male applicants from the Middle East who had changed their names each mentioned that their Muslim names made them ‘less [a] human being’ and more a ‘social misfit’: ‘My colleagues do not call my name because they cannot pronounce it. So I am reduced to a thing without a name’ (Middle East-born male). A new ‘pronounceable’ name, it is thought, will make it easier to be ‘remembered’: ‘With the new name, people [Swedes] will remember me and my name’ (Turkish-born male).</p>
<p>Some of the name-changers were entrepreneurs and professionals, such as dentists, doctors and lawyers, who needed to make their names publicly known. They saw their Muslim names as seriously damaging their careers, since their clients did not ‘remember their names’. Just like any other stigma, branded Muslim names can be a source of embarrassment and give rise to a sense of insecurity. Compare what the Jewish medical student Paul ‘Moses’ gave as his reason for changing his name in 1901:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I am coldly and hostilely received everywhere only on account of my name … A derisive smile appears on the face of my fellow citizens on mentioning my name, this has almost robbed me of my self-respect, has deprived me of the courage to strive any further, and of my self-confidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306396811425986">27</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There are many psychological implications of bearing a stigmatised name. For instance, invisibility as an individual (as opposed to visibility as a type) aggravates relations with the larger society: ‘I did not want to have that name [Mohammad]. I was in agony and [suffered from] psychological problems. Once, two nurses laughed at my name’ (Iraq-born male). But, with a new name: ‘Now … It is easier to get close to people now. People do not get scared, like they did before, by the old name’ (Bangladesh-born male with Islam in his name). And: ‘I do not need to hide myself any more … I feel more confidence’ (Iraq-born male).</p>
<p>Indeed, the most striking motivation, mentioned on fifty-five application forms, was that Muslim names ‘caused discomfort and offence’ (<italic>väckte obehag och anstöt</italic>) to others. The belief that Muslim names discomfort or offend Swedes indicates just how widespread the experience of anti-Muslim prejudice is. Remarkably, the same argument was used in December 2009 to reject the request of a Muslim couple to name their newborn son Allah. The authorities’ decision referred to an article in the law of naming (<italic>Namnlagen</italic>) which stated that a name should not be approved if it could cause offence or discomfort for the bearer of the name. The Swedish authorities assumed that the name Allah (meaning ‘God’ in Islam and a common boy’s name among Muslims) is of the type to discomfort and cause offence to Swedes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306396811425986">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The distress and embarrassment that immigrants feel about their Muslim names are expressed in how they see themselves as ‘misfits’. When their discomfort is internalised, they may well seek to distance themselves from their origins. This explains the next most commonly cited reason for name-changing: 20 per cent related it in some way to a dissociation from Islam or Arabic identity/ethnicity. The decision to dissociate from Islam was almost always by way of reference to wider society’s view of the religion and its followers:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>My old name was Muslim, Mohammad. So everyone said ‘You are Muslim!’ Now, no one can know who I am. (Iraq-born male)</p>
<p>I do not want to be associated with Islam and the prophet Muhammad … It irritates me. (Middle East-born male)</p>
<p>Now it is easier to pronounce my name and there is no ‘Islam’ in it. (Middle East-born male)</p>
<p>After twenty years in Sweden, I feel I belong to the European culture. I have changed my way of thinking and have converted to Catholicism. But it feels that my Muslim name and surname prevent me from becoming a full [fullvärdig] citizen. (male with Arabic name)</p>

</p>
<p>An explicit wish to dissociate themselves from Islam (mentioned on 121 forms) and an implicit wish to pass as non-Muslim (through Europeanisation of their names, mentioned in seventy-six forms) were expressed by 40 per cent of the applicants. A recurring issue raised by name-changers on their forms and during interviews was the selection of new ‘neutral’ names. By ‘neutral’ they meant those names that ‘sounded international’ and were difficult to connect with Islam and to their ethnicity:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>No one would wonder which country I come from … My old name was Arabic. With my new name, I am treated like a human being. I am not involved, either, in conflicts about foreigners. (Turkish-born female)</p>
<p>Now, with the new name, I am more go-ahead. I am more active now and do not need to explain where my name comes from. (Middle East-born male)</p>
<p>My old name was Turkish … Now one does not hear [from my name] where I am from. My first name is Arabic, but my surname is neutral. (Lebanese-born female)</p>
<p>My new name sounds less Arabic and it is not obvious where it is from. I am more comfortable. (Afghanistan-born male)</p>
<p>[My new name] is international. It cannot be identified as coming from the Middle East. (Iraq-born male)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Name-changers’ desire for ‘neutral’ names relates to John Stuart Mill’s idea that a proper name is denotative and not connotative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306396811425986">29</xref></sup> In Mill’s view, denotative names, unlike connotative ones, label people, but reveal nothing about the personality behind the mask. Those who change their Muslim names to ‘neutral’ ones are trying to erase the connotation between themselves and a stigmatised and demonised religion, ethnicity and region. Like the function of ritual masks against danger or evil eyes, denotative (neutral) names are believed to protect immigrants against discrimination and racism.</p>
<p>‘Neutralising’ one’s name, and thereby disassociating oneself from those who are different, is an attempt to increase the potential for assimilation through ‘performing whiteness’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306396811425986">30</xref></sup> John Tehranian, studying non-European immigrants’ petitions for naturalisation in the first half of the twentieth century in the US, stated that: ‘Successful litigants demonstrated evidence of whiteness in their character, religious practices and beliefs, class orientation, language, ability to intermarry, and a host of other traits that had nothing to do with intrinsic racial grouping.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306396811425986">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>My new name ends with ‘man’. Many think that it is Irish or Dutch. (Iranian-born male)</p>
<p>People notice that I am immigrant, but they think I am from France. I am treated differently. I got a job. (Iranian-born female)</p>
<p>I am happy. Many believe that [my new name] is East European. (Middle East-born male)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The stigma of having a Muslim name is best highlighted in those cases where the bearer of the name is neither Muslim, nor from the Middle East, and yet experiences discrimination because of his or her name. A Polish woman who was married to an Afghan man said: ‘[My] old name was Afghan. No one can know where the new one is from. It can be from Spain or so … Big difference now … Everybody is nice to me.’ Renaming to cover one’s identity is not unusual. For example, women in the royal family in Yemen historically took male names, as a cover, just as they veiled their bodies, thus protecting themselves by drawing male attention away from their sexualised selves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306396811425986">32</xref></sup> For Muslim immigrants, changing their names to ‘neutral’ (non-identifiable) ones is a strategy to undermine ethnic/religious expectations. They protect themselves from discrimination and hostility by deflecting society’s attention away from their stigmatised identity.</p>

<title>White masks/Muslim names</title>
<p>In his classic work Black Skin, White Masks, Frantz Fanon explains the psychological aspect of being black in a racist white world. For the black person, who is ripped away from his or her personal history and identity and suffers from an inferiority complex caused by a system of white supremacy, ‘there is only one destiny. And it is white.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306396811425986">33</xref></sup> Fanon believed that a black person is forced to use a white mask to be seen as a human being. A black person has to accept and internalise white values, language and culture to escape the demonisation of blackness. This, in turn, causes alienation for the black person from his or her body and self. In some application forms and in a few interviews, participants highlighted their racial alienation, the mismatch between their bodies and their names. Racial dichotomisation of Muslims and Europeans, expressed in terms of racial attributes, was given as a reason to justify name-changing:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>My [Muslim] surname does not fit my appearance, since I am blond and have blue eyes. (Middle East-born male)</p>
<p>I neither feel Muslim, nor look like a Muslim or an Arab. I am 188cm tall and blond. (Middle East-born male)</p>
<p>I look Swedish. I am blond. But when I mentioned my name, a hesitation emerged. (Iraq-born male)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For people who can ‘racially’ pass (because of skin, hair colour and height) as Swedes, Muslim names are the major barrier to their ‘performing whiteness’. The name-changers’ desire for ‘whiteness’ is based on a social hierarchy of Swedish supremacy and Muslim immigrant inferiority. Wanting to be seen as white or, as Hansen puts it, having ‘near-whiteness’, means also wanting to change status, to become respectable and recognisable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306396811425986">34</xref></sup> ‘[I changed my name because] I look Swedish. I have fair skin and have almost no accent. My parents have a house in Djursholm [an upper-class neighbourhood in Stockholm]. I come from a good background, an elite … I had good school grades’ (Lebanese-born male). Whiteness, here expressed as ‘Swedish-looking’, is constructed around both race and class. Alienation and internalised racial inferiority make whiteness the only way out of social invisibility and immobility.</p>
<p>‘White’ names bring white privileges:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I wanted a name as Swedish as possible. If you change your name, you should change to a European one, not Asian. (Bangladesh-born male)</p>
<p>I wanted to have a European name that is difficult to know where it is from. I wanted to assimilate, to fit into the [Swedish] culture. (Iraq-born male)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>To have a Swedish or European name means that one is assumed to be ‘neutral’ and without a racial or ethnic tag. White identity is often rendered as the norm, as neutral. In contrast to Muslim identity, whiteness is regarded as an empty signifier. The ‘Swedishisation’ of names is also, intentionally or unintentionally, promoted by the bureaucratic and normalising process of name-changing. According to the Swedish law of naming, a recently formed surname is not approved if it, ‘in formation, pronunciation, or spelling, has such a linguistic form that makes the name inappropriate here in this country’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306396811425986">35</xref></sup> This paragraph, in practice, means that officials can and do disapprove of suggested names which, in their spelling or pronunciation, are regarded as non-Swedish.</p>
<p>Through the process of name-changing, there is a negotiation between the name-changers and the officials of the Swedish Patent and Registration Office (<italic>Patent-och registreringsverket</italic>, PRV). In almost 50 per cent of all the cases (488), the final approved new surname was not among the preferred names that the applicant had suggested in the application form. The usual method with which to render suggested names ‘Swedish’ is through adding the suffix ‘son’, ‘gren’ or ‘berg’ to the end of the new name. An Assyrian woman from Turkey applied to change her Turkish name to an Assyrian one: ‘But they [the PRV] said that I would have to add a “son” to it.’ An Iraqi woman’s suggested name was that of a mountain near her hometown in northern Iraq, but the PRV suggested that she, too, add a ‘son’ to it.</p>
<p>On twenty-seven application forms, ethnic or religious motivations for name-changing were mentioned. The applicants were mainly Kurds or Assyrians who wished to change their Turkish names, forced on them by the Turkish state, into Kurdish or Assyrian surnames. However, it is interesting to note that in the process of changing from a Turkish name to an Assyrian or Kurdish one, individuals often ended up with a Swedish-sounding name.</p>
<p>Name-changing is often a painful experience. Several name-changers mentioned their upset at breaking from their background and their anxiety about the reactions of their relatives and community. Some said that they liked their old names, but they felt that they had no choice if they wanted the chance of employment and of making it in Sweden. However, for some of them, racial discrimination persisted even after name-changing:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>They [employers who called her in for a job interview] got a shock when they saw me. (Middle East-born female)</p>
<p>My new name is more accepted … at least before they see my skin colour. (Iranian-born male)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One man was disappointed after name-changing: ‘I thought my appearance would automatically change [after name-changing]. It was a silly idea’ (Iraq-born male).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>What I have attempted here is to offer an exploratory analysis of the reasons for, expectations about and effects of surname-changing among immigrants with Muslim names. In the shadow of increasing anti-Muslim sentiment in western Europe, including Sweden, Muslim populations have been subordinated, socially excluded and rendered socially invisible. How have disadvantage and anti-Muslim racism contributed to a decision to change names? There is tangible evidence here of entrenched anti-Muslim prejudice in Sweden and, significantly, data gleaned from application forms relates to experiences prior to 9/11. This challenges the assertion that pervasive anti-Muslim sentiment in the West originated with the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Anti-Muslim sentiment clearly existed prior to the emergence of the ‘war on terror’ and the global conflict between Muslim extremists and western states.</p>
<p>Names and veils, the two most conspicuous signifiers of Muslim identity, function as stigmas that ‘explain’ Muslim ‘inferiority’ and account for the ‘danger’ that the individual Muslim represents. The stigma reduces the individual Muslim ‘in our minds from a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted one. Such an attribute is a stigma, especially when its discrediting effect is very extensive.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306396811425986">36</xref></sup> Passing (i.e. adopting certain aspects of identity so as to be ‘unmarked’ as Muslim) and covering (i.e. attempting to downplay one’s Muslim identity) are two common ways of coping with the stigma. Name-changers believe and hope that covering their Muslim identity with ‘neutral’ European names will facilitate their individual integration into society. Bearing a Swedish- or European-sounding name is assumed to increase their assimilation potential to integrate into the mainstream. The expectation is that bearing a ‘white’ name will be ‘rewarded with white privilege’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306396811425986">37</xref></sup> Name-changing does not eradicate structural discrimination or racism, but it may diminish the risk of being discriminated against in the initial phase of applying for a job or housing, or during social interaction.</p>
<p>An interesting, though alarming, finding discovered in the writing of this article has been the parallels between the experiences of Jews who changed their names around the turn of the twentieth century in Germany and the experiences of Muslim immigrants in Sweden almost a century later. The similarity in reasoning given by Jews and Muslims for name-changing is striking. As Jews a century ago tried to escape discrimination, Muslims now abandon familiar surnames to take invented ones. Invented names, although Swedish-sounding, are signifiers of otherness and continue to differentiate name-changing immigrants from Swedes. Since those who change their names are not allowed to take existing Swedish surnames, they are identified with a past from which they were hoping to dissociate themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306396811425986">38</xref></sup> However, one main difference between Jews who changed names in the early twentieth century and Muslims who did the same at the end of the same century is their social position. While name-changers among Jews were often from a well-educated and bourgeois background and saw their branded names as an obstacle to ultimately joining ‘aristocratic circles’, Muslim name-changers in Sweden struggle to land their first job interview.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306396811425986">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>It should be emphasised, however, that the majority of people with Muslim names do not change their surnames. Nevertheless, the arguments and reasons mentioned by name-changers denote an experience of living in an unwelcoming society. Societal pressures have forced individuals to ‘normalise’ their Muslim surnames into less ‘divergent’ and more familiar names; for Swedes, that is. Conversion to ‘near-whiteness’ is a central feature in the process of name-changing in the current context. Individuals whose cases are examined in this study all wished, in some way, to gloss over their ‘fundamental imperfection’: Muslimhood. In other words, they are attempting to gain their rightful access to those social, economic and political rights from which their religion and ethnicity have disentitled them.</p>
