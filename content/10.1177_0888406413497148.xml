<p>Welcome to the third issue of Volume 36! Many of us are finishing a summer filled with teaching, meetings, and more meetings. We hope many of you have had a chance to recharge with family vacations, and we are looking forward to seeing all of you at the fall TED conference in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>This issue examined several topics related to preparation of special and general educators. In the first paper, Allison Kretlow and Shawnna Helf studied the extent to which a national sample of kindergarten, first-, and second-grade teachers reported using evidence-based reading curricula. Their results suggested that very few curricula teachers used have been evaluated using research designs that meet federal guidelines. In addition, few teachers reported using resources from their undergraduate or graduate coursework. In the second paper, preservice (both elementary and special education) teachers’ perceptions of inclusion as they partnered for a classroom management course and a field placement were reviewed. Patricia Alvarez McHatton and Audra Parker found that elementary and special education preservice teachers follow markedly different trajectories across their teaching education programs. Elementary teachers experienced a positive increase in their attitude toward inclusion following a collaborative course/field experience. In contrast, special education teachers remained relatively stagnant in their attitudes toward inclusion as a result of the collaborative course/field experience and slightly decreased as they completed their final internship. The authors suggested that preparation of both general and special educators must extend beyond the university classroom, and provide both with genuine opportunities to work with and learn from each other. The third paper written by Rebecca Gehrke and Martha Cocchiarella explored preservice teachers’ knowledge of inclusion based on their coursework and field experiences prior to student teaching, and determined alignment of coursework and field experience expectations. The results suggested differences across elementary, secondary, and special education teacher preparation experiences at the undergraduate level. The authors concluded that Institutions of Higher Education need to provide preservice teachers with less fragmented, disjointed experiences related to inclusion, and instead present inclusion as a complex, contextual concept that may be implemented in varying degrees across schools and classrooms.</p>
<p>The fourth paper provided a literature review conducted by Serra De Arment, Evelyn Reed, and Angela Wetzel on teachers’ adaptive expertise with a summary of applications for designing teacher preparation. The authors proposed several steps in the application of adaptive expertise framework to the design and evaluation of special education teacher preparation programs. The next paper by Ann Sledge and Barbara Pazey provided a literature review of current efforts to reform practices in teacher assessment, and the authors made recommendations for emerging teacher evaluation systems that accurately distinguish between effective and ineffective teachers. In particular, the authors discussed the difficulties of incorporating valid measures of student performances as a component of the teacher evaluation process for special education teachers.</p>
<p>Margaret Werts and Ellen Carpenter, authors of the final paper of this issue, surveyed special education teachers in one state to determine their knowledge of who in their schools perform the tasks involved in the Response to Intervention (RTI) process. The teachers were asked what their roles and responsibilities were in reference to RTI. The authors concluded that collaboration among educators to accomplish the RTI tasks is vital to the use of RTI if it is to be used to further educational goals and objectives of individual students.</p>
<p>Our vision for <italic>Teacher Education and Special Education</italic> (<italic>TESE</italic>) is to continue the long-standing tradition of publishing high quality research and commentary on teacher education and special education. We hope to increase the number of manuscripts reviewed, so please send in your manuscripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tese">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tese</ext-link>). We also look forward to increasing our readership nationally and internationally; we hope you will encourage your friends to read <italic>TESE</italic> by going to the website and signing up for SAGE Journal email alerts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tes.sagepub.com/cgi/alerts">http://tes.sagepub.com/cgi/alerts</ext-link>). In addition, we have several links available for our readers on special topics and issues. These links will allow you to find several articles on one topic. Please see the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tes.sagepub.com/cgi/collection">http://tes.sagepub.com/cgi/collection</ext-link>. We hope to also widen our viewership by providing podcasts on topics we examine at <italic>TESE</italic>. Our first podcast completed by the “school-to-prison pipeline” special issue editors and authors can be found at the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tes.sagepub.com/site/misc/Index/Podcasts.xhtml">http://tes.sagepub.com/site/misc/Index/Podcasts.xhtml</ext-link>. This podcast is timely, given the latest national discussions on gun control and children with disabilities.</p>
<p>We recognize that the success of <italic>TESE</italic> is a collaborative, team effort. The <italic>TESE</italic> journal is only as good as the manuscripts received and the quality of the reviews posted by members of the editorial board. We want to thank in advance those of you who will submit your best work in the area of teacher preparation to <italic>TESE</italic>, as well as those on the Board of Reviewers who will spend quality time providing thoughtful and constructive suggestions to their colleagues. We look forward to receiving your manuscripts, reviews, feedback, and ideas to improve the journal. Together, we can continue <italic>TESE</italic>’s tradition of quality scholarship!</p>
