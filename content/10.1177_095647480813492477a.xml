<p>Like many others who will never be a guest on BBC Radio's <italic>Desert Island Discs</italic>, I am nevertheless ready with my choice of luxury item – a grand piano, so I can belatedly rectify the teenage error of abandoning the piano before I learned to play it properly.</p>
<p>By his own account, <italic>The Guardian's</italic> editor Alan Rusbridger suffered the same lingering regret. Not that he had abandoned music in general. Far from it; he had always made music in various chamber groups, enjoyed playing the clarinet, and indeed the piano. He even spent a week each summer at “piano camp” in France, where assorted amateurs encouraged one another's efforts. But for all his fluent sight-reading, he was never able to eliminate the mistakes and weaknesses that bedevil those whose playing is not grounded in concentrated practice.</p>
<p>Then at the 2010 piano camp Alan met Gary, a former Manchester cab driver now running a mail order business in leather clothing. There seemed nothing special about Gary's playing. Yet on the last evening he astonished the rest of them with an almost faultless rendering of Chopin's ferociously difficult <italic>G minor Ballade No. 1</italic>.</p>
<p>Rusbridger took this as a challenge. He would give himself a year, with a practising target of 20 minutes a day (ridiculously small by any professional standard) to demonstrate that he, too, could transcend an amateur pianist's limitations – his inability to memorise, his inadequate scales and arpeggios – to produce at least a respectable performance of the same intimidating work. What's more he would record the whole enterprise in a diary.</p>
<p>This book is that diary. It begins on August 6, 2010 and runs through to December 13 the following year. And as you can see from those dates, Rusbridger had unknowingly chosen to combine his musical challenge with the immense professional task of leading <italic>The Guardian</italic> through one of the most dramatic episodes in its history – collaborating with the “brilliant, elusive, slippery” Julian Assange in the WikiLeaks disclosure of thousands of state secrets, breaking the Milly Dowler phone-hacking story that wrecked Murdoch's London operation and led to the Leveson inquiry, while also covering the Arab Spring, the international banking crisis, the London riots and the Japanese tsunami.</p>
<p>For months he barely got any sleep, let alone a quiet 20 minutes to concentrate on the Chopin <italic>Ballade</italic>.</p>
<p>Any journalist will find Rusbridger's personal account of these news events engrossing. For all the seemingly relaxed, collegiate atmosphere of <italic>The Guardian</italic> newsroom, there was nothing remotely amateur about the multi-national operation to release the WikiLeaks cables simultaneously (though it nearly came to grief when a newspaper vendor at Basel station started selling copies of <italic>Der Spiegel</italic> too early). On the other front, reporter Nick Davies worked on the phone-hacking story for three years before public disgust at the Milly Dowler case finally overwhelmed the “one rotten apple” defence put up by the <italic>News of the World</italic> and its police contacts.</p>
<p>As Christopher Hitchens pointed out, this was an issue of such public importance, there was no room on <italic>The Guardian</italic> side for the unwritten journalistic code that “dog does not eat dog”. Nor did it mitigate bitter recrimination from the Murdoch camp, in spite of Nick Davies's insistence that his story was driven by disaffected former <italic>News of the World</italic> reporters. One dignified <italic>Sun</italic> executive despatched a toilet roll to Rusbridger's office by courier – with instructions.</p>
<p><italic>Play it Again</italic> is an extraordinary book, in that for many people its two components will have no connection. Rusbridger's obsessive struggle to master the <italic>G minor Ballade</italic> without any proper practice time, albeit helped by an array of teachers and professional pianists such as Murray Perahia and Emanuel Ax, is not recorded merely as a structural device. Page after detailed page is devoted to his choice of fingering, some new trick to help memorise the music (and you get the full annotated score).</p>
<p>At only one dramatic point are his twin narratives obviously in harmony. Having flown to Libya in a brave and eventually successful bid to extract an Iraqi <italic>Guardian</italic> correspondent from Gaddafi's prison, Rusbridger is kept waiting in a deserted hotel. There he discovers a Czech-built Petrof grand – an unexpected opportunity to get out the Chopin and put in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>However, by the end of the book (when he does manage to play the <italic>Ballade</italic> to relieved and admiring friends) a broad unifying theme also emerges. He finds a connection between the way in which amateur ‘Hausmusik’ once enriched German musical life and the contribution today's bloggers, tweeters and Wikipedia editors make to the digital revolution in which his newspaper is struggling to survive. And he calls on his readers to celebrate this “rebirth of an amateur tradition”. I'm not quite so sure, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book.</p>
