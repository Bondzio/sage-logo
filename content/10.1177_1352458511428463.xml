<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) mainly presents amongst those of working age. Depending upon the type of MS, many people embark upon a long period of managing their day-to-day work-related needs in the face of intermittent and sometimes persistent disabling symptoms. The objective of this study was to explore the concept of work instability (WI) following the onset of MS and develop a Work Instability Scale (WIS) specific to this population.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> WI amongst those with MS in work was explored through qualitative interviews which were then used to generate items for a WIS. Rasch analysis was used to refine the scaling properties of the MS-WIS, which was then validated against expert vocational assessment by occupational health physiotherapists and ergonomists.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The resulting measure is a 22-item, self-administered scale which can be scored in three bands indicating low, medium and high risk of WI (job retention) problems. The scale meets modern psychometric requirements for measurement, indicated by adequate fit to the Rasch model with absence of local dependency and differential item functioning (DIF) by age, gender and hours worked.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The scale presents an opportunity in routine clinical practice to take positive action to reduce sickness absence and prevent job loss.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Beyond childhood the risk of developing symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) rises steeply with age, reaching a peak at about 30 years, remaining high in the fourth decade, then falling off sharply and becoming low in the sixth decade. Given the peak age of onset, the capacity to work is often altered. Consequently, several studies have shown that a high proportion (50–80%) of MS patients are unemployed within 10+ years of disease onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511428463">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511428463">2</xref></sup> Recently, in a large cohort of patients with a mean disease duration of 18 years, over half the patients were unemployed at the baseline of a longitudinal study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511428463">3</xref></sup> One study showed this was unrelated to the level of disability, suggesting that a complex interaction of factors may be present in determining job retention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511428463">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Various factors related to the continuing employment of individuals with MS are identified in the literature, and these encompass both disease and demographic characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511428463">1</xref></sup> The disease characteristics that have been shown to be significant are: degree of physical impairment (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] &gt;6.5), cognition, age at diagnosis, and the duration and course of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511428463">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511428463">6</xref></sup> Multivariate analysis of the factors associated with unemployment has identified diagnostic category, clinical course, occupation group and age as the strongest predictors of time to unemployment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511428463">7</xref></sup> The study concluded that patients with a non-remittent clinical course, aged 30 years and over and doing heavy physical work should be considered at high risk for early unemployment due to MS. Indeed, manual labour, private sector employment and lack of accessible transportation to get to and from work have all been associated with unemployment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511428463">8</xref></sup> Females have also been shown to be at increased risk of premature unemployment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511428463">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511428463">5</xref></sup> A number of studies have also found that higher education was associated with lower probability of unemployment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511428463">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511428463">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511428463">9</xref></sup> Thus, a relapsing–remitting course, higher educational level and less physically demanding work have been shown to significantly predict longer time to disability pension in the total MS population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511428463">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>A survey focusing specifically on women with MS, and their employment issues, found that 44% of the 252 women who were employed at the time of the study were limited in the type and amount of work they were able to do because of MS symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511428463">11</xref></sup> Difficulty with the symptoms of MS was cited by 77% of women who were unemployed, and insufficient energy to combine home and paid work was reported by 60% as the primary reason for leaving employment.</p>
<p>Yet a qualitative study of 14 patients with MS found that many of the participants did not want to give up work, as they saw employment as a valued activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511428463">12</xref></sup> Hence they did not appreciate well-intended advice such as ‘take it easy’ and ‘avoid work that is too stressful’, but preferred to devise strategies that enabled them to continue their work. These strategies included setting priorities, given their ‘time and energy’ were limited. Also, they altered the way they carried out tasks, in order to accommodate the symptoms of MS or the challenges presented by the working environment. They felt they had to be vigilant in anticipating potential problems, and took more responsibility for their disease.</p>
<p>This proactive approach to maintaining work, and the complex set of factors which can determine whether job retention is possible, suggests that the concept of ‘work instability’ (WI) may be relevant for multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511428463">13</xref></sup> This concept arose from the recognition that the vocational impact of any incapacity must relate to an interaction between that individual and the demands of their work. Consequently the term was coined to describe the extent of any mismatch between functional (in)capacity and work demands at a point in time, and its potential impact on job retention/security. Originally developed in the context of rheumatoid arthritis, it has subsequently been expanded into a range of diagnoses, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), for which it was defined as:</p>
<p><italic>‘…a state in which the consequences of a mismatch between an individual’s functional and/or cognitive abilities and the demands of their job can threaten continuing employment if not resolved’</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511428463">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is when WI is present that the individual is vulnerable to job loss, and arguably this is the time at which vocational rehabilitation and other interventions are of greatest preventive importance in relation to work. Consequently, vigilance is required as much by professionals caring for those with MS as by those living with MS who wish to retain their working capacity. Thus, if it were possible to screen for WI, this could indicate the level of risk of job loss, and provide clinicians and others with an effective tool to facilitate early, appropriate referral for job retention measures to be implemented. The current study sets out to develop such a scale for MS, validated against a gold standard of full vocational assessment (VA) undertaken by occupational physiotherapists and ergonomists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458511428463" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>The design of the study incorporated five stages, each with separate recruitment of people with MS. Ethical approval was obtained from the local research ethics committee (LREC) of the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. All participants were given an information leaflet regarding their particular stage of the study, and signed consent was obtained prior to the qualitative interviews. Subjects for the study were recruited from various sources at different stages of the study, including an existing MS database and MS specialist nurses.</p>
<sec id="section3-1352458511428463">
<title>Stage 1. Qualitative interviews and analysis</title>
<p>The items for the proposed scale were to be based upon the lived experience of those with MS, and particularly their experience of maintaining their ability to work. Thus, qualitative interviews were used to elicit these experiences. The sample for qualitative interviews was drawn by purposive sampling, to ensure adequate coverage of occupational groups across both sexes. As MS has a 2:1 female to male ratio, it was planned to recruit twice as many women as men. Job categories were defined by ‘white-collar’ or ‘blue-collar’ work to provide a crude indication of the physical extent of the job. Disease type was defined in terms of progressive and non-progressive disease. Non-progressive disease (or relapsing–remitting MS) was defined as the condition in which clearly defined acute attacks occurred, followed by a full or partial recovery to the pre-existing level of disability with no disease progression between attacks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511428463">15</xref></sup> Inclusion criteria were having MS and still working, either full or part time, or having been off work on sick leave for less than 6 months, and being between 18 and 65 years of age. Exclusion criteria were having a co-existing serious illness, being unemployed, or having been on sick leave for over 6 months. All subjects had a definite diagnosis of MS and were aware of their diagnosis. Guidelines from the international panel on the diagnosis of MS were used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511428463">16</xref></sup> Respondents were informed the interview would last approximately 1 h and would be taped, but were assured the interview would be halted immediately at their request.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458511428463">
<title>Stage 2. Theme identification, item selection and cognitive debriefing</title>
<p>The recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and each manuscript was read several times by three researchers using a content analysis approach to identify any themes relating to work. Within such themes the text was scrutinized to identify potential items for the WI scale. The items were phrased in lay terms and, wherever possible, the exact wording from the interviews was used. In this way an item pool for the questionnaire was established, and this constituted the set of items for the first draft of the questionnaire.</p>
<p>This first draft MS-WIS questionnaire was subjected to <italic>cognitive debriefing</italic>. The objective of this was to assess its face validity. Field tests were carried out on ten employed people with MS (not previously interviewed) who were asked to complete a draft of the scale and discuss how easy it was to understand and complete. They were asked to complete the questionnaire with a view to highlighting items that were difficult to understand, difficult to interpret or quite simply did not make sense. It was also assessed whether or not the items in the scale conveyed the same meaning to everyone. The cognitive debrief was undertaken in a clinic setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1352458511428463">
<title>Stage 3. Internal and external construct validity</title>
<p>Following adjustment arising from the cognitive debriefing, a revised draft questionnaire, together with some comparator measures (The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale [MSIS–29]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511428463">17</xref></sup> and The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale [MFIS]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511428463">18</xref></sup>), was sent by postal questionnaire to people who satisfied the recruitment criteria, and who lived within the local area. The Leeds MS database held 700 subjects aged less than 65 years old. Half were randomly selected based upon previous experience of response rates using the Register.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511428463">19</xref></sup> It was expected that half of this population would be in employment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511428463">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511428463">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511428463">8</xref></sup> For the Rasch analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511428463">20</xref></sup> (see below) it was known that a sample size of 109 respondents would estimate the item difficulty, with α of 0.01, to within ± 0.7 logits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511428463">21</xref></sup> A sample size of 120 is also sufficient to test for item bias, where at α of 0.01 a difference of 0.5 standard deviations within the residuals can be detected for any two groups with β of 0.20.</p>
<p>The Rasch model is the current standard for the development of unidimensional scales (e.g. of impairment or quality of life) delivering metric quality outcomes in health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511428463">22</xref></sup> Briefly, data collected from questionnaires (or for scales completed by clinical staff) which include items for a new (or existing) scale, which are intended to be summated into an overall score (which may be at the subscale or overall level), are tested against the expectations of this measurement model, which is a probabilistic form of Guttman scaling, and a variety of fit statistics determine whether this is the case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511428463">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511428463">24</xref></sup> Both summary and individual item and person fit statistics are available to assess fit of data to model expectations. χ<sup>2</sup> and ANOVA fit statistics should be non-significant. Individual item residuals should be within ± 2.5, and summary residual standard deviations should approximate 1.0 (in practice be less than 1.4).</p>
<p>Within the framework of Rasch measurement, the scale should also work in the same way, irrespective of which group (based on age, gender or, for example, disease duration) is being assessed. For example, in the case of measuring WI, younger and older age groups should have the same probability of affirming an item <italic>if they have the same level of WI</italic>. If for some reason one group did not display the same probability of affirming the item (in the dichotomous case), then this item would be deemed to display differential item functioning (DIF). Consequently, every item is checked for DIF by age and gender and for any clinical or other subgroup relevant to the analysis.</p>
<p>A reliability statistic (person separation index) is also computed, and is interpreted in the same way as Cronbach’s alpha.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511428463">25</xref></sup> Finally, a formal test of unidimensionality is undertaken by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) of the residuals to assess the patterning. Items with the highest positive and negative correlations within this first residual factor are used to construct two smaller scales, anchored to the item difficulties of the main analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511428463">26</xref></sup> The person estimates from these two subsets of items are then subjected to a series of <italic>t</italic>-tests. A non-significant difference between the two person estimates would support the unidimensionality of the scale (confidence interval for proportions of <italic>t</italic>-tests outside ± 1.96 overlapping 5%). All Rasch analysis procedures were performed using the RUM2030 computer software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511428463">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The postal questionnaire consisted of a number of scales to examine the person’s ability to continue working, and the effect that, for example, fatigue and other symptoms have on employment. The questionnaire incorporated:</p>
<list id="list1-1352458511428463" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The draft MS-WIS</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511428463">17</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511428463">18</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The MSIS-29 includes physical and psychological components, whereas the MFIS focuses upon the impairment of fatigue. These constructs are expected to demonstrate a strong correlation with WI. Thus, data for the draft MS-WIS from this postal questionnaire were fitted to the Rasch measurement model, and correlated against the various comparator measures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1352458511428463">
<title>Stage 4. Criterion validity – vocational assessment</title>
<p>There is no instrument currently available to measure WI in MS. At present the only way to identify people who are experiencing WI is through a comprehensive VA. This type of assessment can, in the UK, be accessed through the JobCentre Plus Access to Work programme and includes analysis of work tasks, work organization and postures as well as analysis of the medical history and consideration of psychosocial factors that may be impacting on an individual’s ability to manage at work. Following such an assessment, various interventions may be offered, ranging from advice and relatively minor changes in work practice to provision of specialist tools and equipment and assistive technology.</p>
<p>In the current study these were all carried out by recognized experts in the field of disability and work, all of whom were chartered occupational physiotherapists and ergonomists. The assessments each took the form of a semi-structured interview to explore the nature of the health condition and the nature of any impairment arising from it. The assessor then also explored the subject’s work demands and exposures (including hours of work, work patterns, workload, physical demands, organizational factors, work environment, workplace support networks [colleagues, occupational health, etc.], flexibility, degree of control, etc.). With this information the assessor was then able to score on a scale of low, medium or high the extent of the subject’s ability to cope with their work (WI) as a function of any restriction arising from the impairment in the context of their specific work demands.</p>
<p>A sample of 13 subjects who had returned the questionnaire and were in work agreed to participate in a full VA. These were representative of the larger sample by age and sex. The VAs followed an agreed format and took approximately 1 h to complete. The first two patients were assessed by both assessors to ensure consistency. Independent assessments were only carried out once it was clear that they were achieving 100% agreement. The experts then carried out full VAs on the remaining 11 subjects. The assessors were blinded to the results of the draft questionnaire filled in by all 13 participants immediately before their assessment. At the end of each assessment the expert indicated the level of intervention judged appropriate by allocating a WI score between 0 and 4, representing increasing risk of WI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511428463">Figure 1</xref>). The scoring system was devised for a previous similar study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511428463">13</xref></sup> following consultation with experts who regularly carry out this type of assessment. The explanation beneath each level of WI reflects the expert’s view of the level of intervention recommended to assist the individual in terms of job retention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511428463">13</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>The questionnaire responses of these subjects were validated against the result of the assessment. Items from the draft questionnaire which discriminated across the levels of WI were retained. Further Rasch analysis was then undertaken on the revised item set in the data from the postal survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1352458511428463">
<title>Stage 5. Test–retest reliability</title>
<p>Finally, the revised MS-WIS was sent to a further sample, who were asked to complete a second questionnaire 2 weeks later to assess the test–retest reliability. This reliability was assessed by Spearman’s correlation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1352458511428463" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty-seven people were interviewed for the qualitative study, 15 men and 12 women. It proved difficult to recruit more females as many tended not to have paid employment outside the home. It was extremely difficult to find a female with progressive disease in a ‘blue-collar’ job, which are the most significant demographic features cited for job loss, and this is reflected by the fact that only one person was recruited to that particular cell of the sampling frame. Four main areas emerged from the qualitative analysis of the data as factors contributing to WI:</p>
<list id="list2-1352458511428463" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Physical and cognitive aspects of the disease and their impact upon work</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Working environment and organizational aspects</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Social aspects of the working environment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Psychological aspects of working</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>One hundred and twenty-two statements representative of these themes were extracted from the transcripts and compiled into a draft questionnaire. At cognitive debriefing two items were discarded as the participants felt they were uncommon, not relevant or difficult to comprehend, and a second draft of the scale was then produced.</p>
<p>Three hundred and fifty questionnaires were sent out in the first round, along with a reminder to complete the questionnaire that was sent out 4 weeks afterwards. These data were supplemented by further questionnaires given to patients attending outpatient clinics who were not yet on the database but were known to be working. Collating these data created a sample of 225 respondents, of whom 68 (30.2%) were male and 157 (69.8%) were female. The mean age of the respondents was 47.84 ± 9.76 years with a range of 24 to 72 years. Two-fifths (40.2%) of the respondents used a wheelchair some or all of the time, while 130 (57.8%) reported never using a wheelchair. Furthermore, 40 (17.8%) of the respondents reported that they needed help in completing the questionnaire. Of the 225, 109 (48.4%) were working, which satisfied the basic sample size requirement for Rasch analysis. Those out of work were significantly older than those in work. The mean age of the ‘in work’ sample was 42.9 ± 8.31 years, compared with 52.53 ± 8.74 for the ‘out of work’ sample (<italic>t</italic> = −8.42, df = 221, <italic>p</italic> = &lt;0.001).</p>
<p>Initial fit to Rasch model expectations was poor, with a significant item–trait interaction statistic (χ<sup>2</sup> = 267.9, <italic>p</italic> = &lt;0.001). The person separation index of reliability, which is a measure of how well the items are differentiating persons, was good at 0.966. One possible cause of misfit to model expectations is items that display DIF. Consequently, initial item reduction was focussed on those items displaying DIF, leading to 27 items being removed due to excessive DIF. For example, the item ‘My condition is worse if I get too hot at work’ displayed DIF by gender, meaning that, at the same underlying level of WI, men and women were likely to give different responses to the question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511428463">Figure 2</xref>). Males were more likely to affirm this item at any given level of WI. Another item, ‘I have trouble standing upright sometimes’, displayed DIF by age group, with older respondents more likely to affirm this item at any given level of WI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458511428463">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>After removal of items displaying excessive DIF, those showing continuing misfit were examined. For example, the item ‘I don’t like it when people treat me differently’ had both a low χ<sup>2</sup> probability of 0.000079 and a fit residual of 3.106, which both indicate a misfit to model expectations. The item characteristic curve showed a lack of discrimination between different levels of WI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1352458511428463">Figure 4</xref>). In other words, this item was likely to be affirmed irrespective of the level of WI, and thus it displayed a lack of the expected probabilistic relationship between the item and other items on the scale (summed to provide the latent estimate of WI), and was therefore removed from the scale. Other items were also found to misfit, and in this way the MS-WIS was reduced from 120 to 85 items. At this stage the overall χ<sup>2</sup> item trait interaction statistic showed good fit to the Rasch model, with a non-significant χ<sup>2</sup> probability (χ<sup>2</sup> = 110.427, χ<sup>2</sup> probability = 0.033). Person separation index reliability remained good at 0.956. This 85-item scale was then carried forward to the test–retest questionnaire and the criterion-related discrimination analysis.</p>

</fig>
<p>Initially 355 questionnaires were sent out in the second round for the test–retest analysis. The response rate was 53.5% as 190 people returned them. Of these 190 people, only 61 were found to be working (32%). Just over a quarter (27%) of the patient sample were in the age group 18–40 years, while the other 73% were aged 41–65, and it was made up of 43 women (70%) and 18 men (30%). Almost two out of five had ‘blue collar’ work, and 48% worked full time. A repeat questionnaire was distributed 2 weeks later to the 61 people who were in work, and 49 of these returned a second completed questionnaire, a response rate of 80%. None of the 49 people who completed the scale twice had reported a relapse or undergone a significant change in their condition over the 2-week period.</p>
<p>At the same time as the test–retest survey, further analysis was undertaken on the small set of questionnaires administered at the same time as the VA. The experts who completed the gold standard assessments identified five levels of WI, each representing progressively increasing levels of mismatch between functional capacity and job demands and therefore risk of work disability; these were subsequently reduced to three categories for analysis purposes. Each item was graded with regard to its ability to discriminate between levels of risk. All items for which the percentage of affirmations of risk increased between the lowest and the highest risk categories were retained. Forty-four items satisfied this requirement and were taken together and re-analysed within the Rasch framework, using a merged sample of the first postal data along with the first set of test–retest questionnaires. This produced a sample size of 170, resulting in more stable calibrations than if either sample were taken independently. Initially, items were assessed for local dependency based on their content, their residual correlations and the loadings in a PCA of the residuals. Items were also assessed for DIF by gender, age group and working hours (full time or part time), along with their overall fit characteristics. The apparent dimensionality, as identified by the <italic>t</italic>-tests, was also monitored. Items were removed on the basis of these assessments until a set remained that displayed no local dependency, no DIF and good model-fit characteristics. This resulted in a 22-item scale. The remaining 22 items displayed a good overall fit to the Rasch model (item residual mean −0.260 (SD 0.901); person residual mean −0.217 (SD 0.847); χ<sup>2</sup> probability 0.293). The scale had a PSI reliability of 0.84 and a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.89. These values relate to a scale that is consistent with use at the individual level. The scale also displays good targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1352458511428463">Figure 5</xref>). None of the individual items displayed any misfit on any of the individual item tests of fit in RUMM2030; that is, there was no misfit at a χ<sup>2</sup> and ANOVA item-fit probability value of 0.01, and all standardized residuals were within the range from +2 to −2. None of the final 22 items displayed any DIF by gender, age group or working hours at a Bonferroni adjusted probability level. There were also no residual correlations above 0.25 and no apparent patterns in the PC loadings. Additionally, the series of <italic>t</italic>-tests for comparing person estimates showed that nine of 162 (5.56%) of the tests were significant, with a lower bound confidence interval of 2.2%, which offers support of an acceptable scale unidimensionality. This final 22-item scale demonstrated a test–retest (Spearman’s) correlation of 0.876, suggesting good reliability over time. Additionally, a test–retest DIF analysis was carried out on the test–retest sample to assess DIF by time point. This analysis also showed all items to be free from DIF by time point.

<p>The scale scores from this 22-item scale were then examined across three aggregated levels of expert-defined WI to determine appropriate cut points to identify those needing modifications at work. These three levels were (0) none or little problem; (1) advice or intervention needed; (2) severe problem. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using these cut points on the gold standard sample. Cut points were set at scores of 11 and 17 calculated from the 22-item scale. The lower cut point of 10/11 represented a shift from a low to medium level of risk; the higher cut point of 16/17 marked the transition to severe problem. These cut points gave a sensitivity of 78% at level 10/11 (<italic>They are having problems at work and the scale states they have a problem</italic>), and 80% specificity. The upper cut point is 100% sensitive (<italic>They have a severe problem and the scale states there is a problem</italic>) with 100% specificity. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511428463">Table 1</xref> these raw score (ordinal) cut points are equivalent to 10.8 and 14.8 on the metric.</p>
<p>There were significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005) and substantive (rho &gt; 0.3) associations between MS-WIS and the concurrent scales. As expected, positive correlations were found between MS-WIS and MFIS (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) (rho = 0.807, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and MSIS (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale) (rho = 0.808, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Positive correlations mean that those who had a high risk of WI also had high levels of fatigue and their multiple sclerosis symptoms had impacted greatly on their day-to-day life in the previous 2 weeks, and vice versa.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MS is known to have a significant impact on the working lives of those affected, with a high risk of job loss. While the predictive factors for job loss have been well documented,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511428463">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511428463">6</xref></sup> little is known about the period of ‘work instability’ that people experience prior to job loss. Screening instruments for this have been developed in other chronic diseases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511428463">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511428463">14</xref></sup> and this paper has reported on the development of a new scale to screen for WI in those with MS. A simple, reliable and valid screening scale with two cut points offers the clinician the opportunity for the early identification and more proactive management of the risk of job loss.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations to the study. Recruiting those working with MS was always going to be a challenge, and the numbers entered into the current study were at the lower margins of reliability for Rasch analysis. This affects the degree of precision of the person and item estimates. However, in the current study the targeting of the scale was very good; that is, the mean person estimate of WI (−0.056 logits) was close to the mean of the scale (0.0 logits). This will mean that the degree of precision is enhanced (within 0.5 logits at 99% confidence) and thus the low numbers are less problematic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511428463">21</xref></sup> There were also problems with recruitment to the various cells of the theoretical sample frame for the qualitative interview stage; for example, in recruiting blue collar female workers. The impact of this, if any, on item creation is unknown.</p>
<p>The numbers we were able to recruit into the full VA were also low, although consistent with recent similar developments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511428463">14</xref></sup> The impact of this is unknown, but it is likely that, because the number of risk groups identified in the VA had to be reduced to evaluate the discrimination of items, the scale may lose discriminative power. However, the reliability of the 22-item scale remained high, and this is linked to the number of statistically significant groups of people that can be identified, and thus it would seem that the scale retained discriminative power despite this limitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511428463">28</xref></sup> Other short WI scales have been shown to have considerable discriminative power and thus responsiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458511428463">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The loss of items, reduced to 22 from a starting point of 122 items, may be a significant cause for concern. For example, there is the risk that other relevant dimensions may be left in the discarded data, or that the current 22 items do not represent the optimum set. Much of the discard pile from the Rasch analysis was due to items failing the requirement of invariance (for example bias by gender) or failing to fit the model expectations. However, the majority of items were discarded because they failed to discriminate across the (aggregated) set of risk levels as adjudged by the experts. Thus, for example, it may be that a particular symptom is present at all levels of WI, and does not sufficiently discriminate between them. This does not mean that the symptom is unimportant, but, rather, that it does not impact differentially in the context of job retention. This emphasis upon discrimination is the reason why a short dichotomous scale can apparently have high reliability and consequent discriminative power.</p>
<p>There were expected correlations with comparator measures, but replication on a larger sample would allow a more detailed investigation of the relationships between, for example, fatigue, activity limitation and WI.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the item set comprises a mixture of aspects such as motivation, worry about the future, physical symptoms such as problems with hands or with walking, tiredness, lack of support from employers, and strategies to cope with maintaining work. These are, of course, reflective of the issues that emerged from the initial qualitative interviews, and also reflective of all the factors which have been shown earlier to influence job retention. However, rather than ‘manual labour’, they are focussed on the impairments that would affect the ability of the person to undertake and sustain such labour. This is what WI defines – the mismatch between a person’s ability and the job’s demands. This is subtly different from cataloguing the impairments or activity limitations themselves, as would, for example, be found in the comparator measures. Thus, it is whether or not the impairment is interfering with the capacity to undertake the work that is crucial.</p>
<p>Those working with chronic conditions such as MS face continuing challenges with respect to job retention, and, particularly in times when economic circumstances cause contraction of the employment market, they can face additional challenges to their job security. At such times it becomes even more important to provide support to the individual such that their work capacity is not reduced for any prolonged period. As such, the MS-WIS is an early warning screening tool to enable proactive support and intervention to maintain that working capacity.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A simple to use 22-item scale to screen for the risk of sickness absence and job loss among those with MS offers the clinician the opportunity for proactive intervention. Patients above the first cut point will need advice and information, and possible referral. Those above the upper cut point are at much greater risk of job loss, and would require urgent referral to support continuing employment. The scale satisfies strict modern psychometric criteria, and has a level of reliability consistent with individual use. Finally, an advantage of the MS-WIS is that it can offer a transformation of the raw ordinal score into interval level measurement, thus making it suitable for more sophisticated parametric analyses such as structural equation modelling.</p>
