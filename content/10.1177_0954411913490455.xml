<abstract>
<p>Despite their well-known limitations, in vitro experiments have several benefits over in vivo techniques when exploring foot biomechanics under conditions characteristic of gait. In this study, we present a new setup for dynamic in vitro gait simulation that integrates a numerical model for generating the tibial kinematics control input, and we present an innovative methodology to measure full three-dimensional joint kinematics during gait simulations. The gait simulator applies forces to the tendons. Tibial kinematics in the sagittal plane is controlled using a numerical model that takes into account foot morphology. The methodology is validated by comparing joint rotations measured during gait simulation with those measured in vivo. In addition, reliability and accuracy of the control system as well as simulation input and output repeatability are quantified. The results reflect good control performance and repeatability of the control inputs, vertical ground reaction force, center of pressure displacement, and joint rotations and translations. In addition, there is a good correspondence to in vivo kinematics for most patterns of motion at the ankle, subtalar, and Chopart’s joints. Therefore, these results show the relevance and validity of including specimen-specific information for defining the control inputs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Three approaches are commonly used to investigate foot and ankle biomechanics, that is, examination of live subjects, manipulation of mathematical models, and in vitro experimentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913490455">1</xref></sup> Each of these methods contribute to our current understanding of foot and ankle biomechanics. However, in vitro experimentation has specific benefits over other methods, as they allow complete access to all tissues of the foot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411913490455">2</xref></sup> Hence, the effect of subsequent dissections or manipulations of the structures on foot biomechanics can be explored. Moreover, as all applied forces can be fully controlled, high repeatability of the testing conditions can be achieved.</p>
<p>In order to investigate foot function under dynamic conditions representative of gait, several groups have developed a setup for dynamic in vitro gait simulation using cadaveric feet,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913490455">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411913490455">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913490455"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411913490455"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411913490455"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913490455">7</xref></sup> all applying forces to the tendons and controlling tibial kinematics, in some cases supplemented with ground reaction forces. Since the first publication on in vitro gait simulation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913490455">1</xref></sup> each group has focused on improving several aspects of the existing approaches, being mainly the limited degrees of freedom of the mechanism controlling the kinematics of the tibia, the low gait speed, the limited forces applied to the tendons, and the limited ground reaction force magnitudes. In the most recent simulators, most of these targeted improvements were achieved,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411913490455">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913490455">7</xref></sup> thereby improving the validity of simulation results and their relevance for clinical practice. However, some drawbacks remain. One is the lack of specimen specificity of the inputs to the control mechanism, namely, the forces applied to the tendons, ground reaction forces, and tibial kinematics. Therefore, in vitro experimentation still relies to a large extent on arbitrary and manual tuning of the control inputs and observer-dependent evaluation of the simulation results. This inevitably undermines standardization of the simulation procedure and potentially limits the reproducibility of the simulator performance over different specimens.</p>
<p>In this work, we first present a new setup and measurement protocol for dynamic in vitro gait simulations together with a strategy to reconstruct complete three-dimensional (3D) joint kinematics from the collected raw data. Next, we evaluate our innovative approach by presenting the reliability and accuracy of the control system (hereafter referred to as control performance), the repeatability of the inputs to the control system, the repeatability of the simulated kinematics and kinetics, and the correspondence of gait kinematics and kinetics to in vivo.</p>
<p>The setup uses a unique method for generating the tibial kinematics control input, based on a numerical model for knee and ankle motion in the sagittal plane, accounting for the specimen morphology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411913490455">8</xref></sup> This methodology eliminates the need for arbitrary tuning of the tibial kinematics input to the control mechanism for each individual specimen compared with existing approaches. Furthermore, it solves the problem of generating good tibial kinematics control inputs for simulations with feet, having rather extreme dimensions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913490455">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913490455">7</xref></sup> The strategy to calculate 3D joint kinematics allows to calculate joint translations in addition to rotations commonly reported in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913490455">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411913490455"/>

This allows us to calculate and visualize bone motion in the global reference frame and, as such, to provide the reader with data for profound validation of numerical models of the hindfoot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913490455">15</xref></sup> and for validation of other in vitro experiments or in clinical studies that focus on understanding pathological hindfoot kinematics.</p>

<title>Specimen preparation</title>
<p>Six freshly frozen cadaveric feet, all donated for scientific research, were tested in the gait simulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913490455">Figure 1</xref>). A surgeon exposed the tendons of all extrinsic muscles and dissected the muscle belly from the tendons, leaving muscle lines of action and other ankle structures intact. Intracortical titanium pins, 4 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length (ICOS, Newdeal, France), were inserted in the tarsal bones (talus, calcaneus, cuboid, navicular) and the tibia. Their rotation was blocked by a stabilizing device and by inserting a two-component epoxy resin in the bone cavity (Pattex SuperMix Universal 5 min, NV Henkel, Belgium). The stabilizing device consists of a hollow tube with three nails protruding from one end. The device was first nailed on the bone, and the pins were inserted next through the tube and fixed to it with a screw. Their position in the bones was verified using 0.5-mm resolution spiral CT (Aquillion 64, Toshiba Medical Systems B.V., Japan). After preparation, feet were stored in a freezer (−18 °C) and defrosted in a temperature controlled room (18 °C) overnight before testing. Relevant dimensions of all feet, relevant for defining the control inputs to our setup, are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411913490455">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Gait simulator</title>
<p>The gait simulator consists of a framework (ITEM Industrietechnik GmbH, Germany). This framework carries a frame that bears six pneumatic actuators (Festo AG &amp; Co. KG, Germany), each applying loads to the tendons of a cadaveric foot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411913490455">Figure 2</xref>). The foot is mounted in the simulator by the bar in the center of the actuator bearing frame using a cylinder that fits over the tibia and is fixed to the bone using polyester resin (Motip Dupli B.V., The Netherlands). Rotation around the longitudinal axis is blocked by a screw, which results in a system for the simulated knee that allows horizontal translation in the step direction and rotation in the sagittal plane only. A linear guiding system with servo electric motor and encoder (Bosh Rexroth AG, type MSK061C, Bosch Group, Germany) drives the foot bearing frame to simulate the horizontal progression of the tibia through stance. A matching Indradrive<sup>®</sup> controller (Bosh Rexroth AG, type HCS02.1E, Bosch Group, Germany) controls the simulated knee position. Using a digital inclinometer (Solatronic, Fisco Tools Ltd, UK), mounted on top of the actuator bearing frame, the tibia-ground angle at heel contact was controlled to 14° by manually tilting the actuator bearing frame, with the foot mounted in a slight abducted position by rotating the tibia a few degrees outward. This mounting position was visually inspected by verifying the angle between the medial foot border and the forward progression direction of the actuator bearing frame.</p>

</fig>
<p>The actuators, equipped with proportional valves and pressure sensors (Festo AG &amp; Co. KG, Germany), apply load to six distinctive muscle groups. The loading capacity of the actuators was determined based on the scaled force magnitudes calculated using the static optimization for the gait cycle of one test subject, as explained further under the protocol subsection. They are 400 N for the combined Mm. peronei and the M. tibialis posterior, 200 N for the M. flexor hallucis longus and M. flexor digitorum longus, 1000 N for the pretibial muscles (i.e. combined M. extensor hallucis longus, M. extensor digitorum longus, and M. tibialis anterior), 2750 N for the M. triceps surae, and 550 N for the vertical ground reaction force (vGRF).</p>
<p>A load cell (Vishay Tedea-Huntleigh, Vishay Electronic GmbH, Germany), in series with the actuator, measures the force applied to the tendons using custom-built nylon tendon clamps (design based on Tak-Man and Zhang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411913490455">16</xref></sup>). The design of the clamps allows to apply high loads (1800 N) without slippage or rupture of the tendon. The integrity of the retinacula and other guiding structures ensures that the muscle line of action is maintained in the physiological configuration and the moment arm is not influenced by the clamp. A custom-built tensioning device connects the load cell and clamp to allow pretensioning of the chain between actuator and tendon.</p>
<p>The forces applied to the tendons are controlled through a force-feedback control mechanism: a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control loop with hysteresis compensation controls the level of pneumatic pressure and therefore the applied force using the load cell output. Real-time data-processing and control is done on a Dell precision 390 (Dell, USA), running the Pharlab ETS real-time operating system (National Instruments, USA) and Labview programs (National Instruments, USA).</p>
<p>A force plate (Kistler multicomponent force plate, Kistler Instrumente GmbH, Germany) supports the foot. An actuator below the plate applies and modulates the vGRF by displacement control, fitting the measured vertical plate position to a target value, thereby driving the vertical position of the tibia.</p>

<sec id="section5-0954411913490455">
<title>Measurement devices</title>
<p>The motion of the bones that we inserted the intracortical pins (tibia, talus, calcaneus, navicular, and cuboid) is measured during gait simulations by a Krypton Optoelectronic Motion Capture System (Krypton K 600, Metris, Belgium), consisting of two camera modules, each containing three charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The cameras track the motion of five clusters, containing four active markers at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The clusters are mounted on a cube with known dimensions, screwed on the bone imbedded pins. System accuracy for tracking marker positions is 90 µm.</p>
<p>The force plate measures the GRF and ground moments at 1000 Hz. On top of the force plate, a pressure plate (Footscan system, 0.5 m with 3D interface box, RS Scan Int., Belgium) measures the plantar pressure distribution at 500 Hz for 0.8-s gait trials and at 75 Hz for 10-s gait simulations. All data are collected and synchronized by a 16-bit-resolution daqbook (Daqbook 2005, IoTech, USA).</p>

<sec id="section6-0954411913490455">
<title>Protocol</title>
<p>To determine control inputs, first, actuator force magnitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913490455">Figure 3</xref>) were calculated using a multibody simulation of a gait trial of a 47.9-kg, female control subject. Combining inverse analysis and static optimization as implemented in OpenSim,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411913490455">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411913490455">18</xref></sup> individual muscle forces were calculated. Calculated muscle force time variation was compared with available surface electromyography (EMG) signals of the superficial muscles or published muscle timing sequences to validate the optimization results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411913490455">19</xref></sup> These model forces were linearly downscaled by a factor of 2 to ensure cadaveric integrity throughout the testing. The resulting force magnitudes correspond to a simulated body weight (BW) of 25 kg. Before testing, these actuator forces were then minimally tuned (up to a maximum of 10%) for each foot when necessary to obtain a normal plantar pressure distribution over the complete stance phase as well as normal ankle-foot kinematics. More specific, heel strike on the lateral calcaneus, gradual forefoot loading, followed by gradual heel lift were verified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411913490455">5</xref></sup> Once defined, these forces were unchanged in all consecutive tests.</p>

<p>Illustration of the model used to generate the tibial kinematics control input. The foot starts in a 90° position at heel contact and then moves toward a foot flat position after which the simulated knee moves over the ankle. Subsequently, there is a rigid body phase and eventually a plantarflexion motion until push off. The vertical force plate displacement is shown on the bottom left, together with the theoretical sagittal talo-crural joint rotation. Inputs to the model are the foot dimensions, shown on the top left, the initial angle between the shank and the line, perpendicular to the ground (α), and the final amount of PF, expressed by the angle between the shank and the foot (β).</p>

<p>Finally, vertical displacement of the force plate, dictating the relative vertical displacement between knee and ground, was calculated from the horizontal knee displacement combined with a model of sagittal plane motion of the shank and foot, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913490455">Figure 3</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411913490455">8</xref></sup> It takes into account the lower leg length (l), the total foot length (b), measured as the distance between the back of the heel and the head of metatarsal one, the horizontal distance between the heel and the lateral malleolus (q), and the vertical distance between the lateral malleolus and the floor (a).</p>
<p>The experimental protocol started with a static trial with the foot as in normal upright standing and loaded with the simulated BW (25 kg, i.e., 245 N). This foot position was used as a reference for bone kinematics, defining the zero-degree angular position. Thereafter, we collected 10 trials of normal walking per specimen with a stance phase duration of 10 s.</p>

<p>In order to quantify device performance, a regression analysis between the set points and measured control inputs was performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913490455">1</xref></sup> R<sup>2</sup> values, slope S of the regression line, and the root mean-squared error (RMSE) were calculated and averaged over all measurements within each session of 10 trials. R<sup>2</sup> values and S close to one together with low values for the RMSE reflect good apparatus control.</p>
<p>The 3D joint kinematics was calculated by quantifying the relative motion between the anatomical coordinate frames of each bone combination that forms an articulation. The kinematics reflects the positional difference of the distal bone in relation to the proximal one. Landmarks defining the anatomical frame are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411913490455">Table 2</xref>. The landmarks define a plane of the coordinate frame, with the third frame axis perpendicular to it. The planes of the local coordinate frames correspond to the anatomical planes of the respective joints: motion in the sagittal plane is referred to as plantarflexion and dorsiflexion, motion in the frontal plane is referred to as inversion and eversion, and motion in the transverse plane is referred to as abduction and adduction.</p>

<p>Relative motion of these frames was calculated by combining the recorded cluster movement and CT data of the bone pin assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411913490455">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, three consecutive transformations were combined. The first transformation between the technical coordinate frame, related to the titanium cube on which the led cluster is mounted, and the anatomical coordinate frame is calculated using a custom-implemented user interface that allows defining both anatomical and technical coordinate frames on the 3D surface reconstruction of the bone. The second transformation between the cube-related technical frame and the led cluster-related technical frame is known from the design of the assembly of both parts. The third transformation between the marker cluster-related technical frame and the global coordinate frame is calculated from the measured motion of the led clusters in the global coordinate frame. Combining these consecutive transformations allowed to reconstruct the position of the bones in the global coordinate frame and therefore to quantify the relative motion between bones and thus joint kinematics.</p>
<p>Joint kinematics is represented by joint rotations and translations. Rotations are represented by Euler angles (sequence sagittal (z), frontal (x), and transverse (y) plane motions), calculated in a similar way as Lundgren et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411913490455">20</xref></sup> in order to ease the comparison between our results and the golden standard for in vivo foot kinematics. In contrast to Lundgren et al., landmark-based anatomical coordinate frames are defined, with their relative motion representing bone kinematics. This approach mainly reflects anatomy-dependent variability in kinematics and is therefore expected to give better interspecimen repeatability. This could improve the ability to draw general conclusions on gait kinematics, valid for a more global population of feet. Translations were calculated as the displacement of the origin of the distal anatomical coordinate frame along the axes of the proximal anatomical coordinate frame. Data were normalized to 0%–100% of stance. Joint kinematics was corrected for the joint position measured during the static trial by subtracting the rotations and translations measured during this trial from those measured during the gait simulations. Kinematic data from the 10 trials were averaged for each specimen.</p>
<p>In order to quantify the reproducibility of our setup in subsequent trials, repeatability of the kinematic data and measured inputs to the control mechanism was quantified by the coefficient of multiple determination (CMD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411913490455">21</xref></sup> A value of 1 indicates exact repeatability of motion patterns. Furthermore, the SDs of all samples at a specific time instant in the stance phase were calculated and averaged over the complete stance phase as a measure of absolute variability.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the correspondence of our gait simulations to in vivo conditions, we first calculated the range of motion (ROM) of joint rotations and translations and compared it with the golden standard for in vivo kinematics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411913490455">20</xref></sup> and the results of the most recently published in vitro study on foot kinematics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913490455">7</xref></sup> where possible. Next, we calculated the CMD between the average of the 10 repeated trials and the average in vivo data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411913490455">20</xref></sup> for each specimen in order to quantify the correspondence of the simulated motion patterns to those in vivo.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411913490455">Figure 4</xref> shows the quality of the control performance. It displays a good agreement between the set points and the applied inputs as well as a narrow confidence band for the latter. This observation is confirmed by the R<sup>2</sup> values, S, and RMSE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954411913490455">Table 3</xref>) which reflect high control performance. R<sup>2</sup> values are above 0.9 and S is close to one for most muscle actuators and the force plate displacement control. Also the RMSE is acceptable with a maximum of 15.57 N for the M. triceps surae, which is only 1.3% of the maximal force during stance. Although slightly higher when taking into account the limited maximal force magnitudes of 7 and 8 N for the M. flexor hallucis longus and M. flexor digitorum longus, respectively, the RMSEs of 0.74 and 0.69 N are low. Also the force plate position is accurately controlled with an average RMSE of 2.24 mm.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since the first publication on dynamic, cadaveric gait simulation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913490455">1</xref></sup> there have been new developments by multiple groups over the world. Many limitations have been eliminated in subsequent designs, being mainly the limited degrees of freedom of the mechanism controlling the kinematics of the tibia, the low gait speed, the limited forces applied to the tendons, and the limited ground reaction force magnitudes. However, specific problems still remain to be solved, one being the lack of specimen specificity of the inputs to the control mechanism of the gait simulator, in particular of those inputs that define the tibial kinematics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913490455">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913490455">7</xref></sup> Therefore, we developed a new gait simulator that extends performance of current state-of-the-art simulators in the following aspects: first, in our setup, the applied tendon forces are calculated using an inverse dynamics approach and static optimization. In contrast to other groups that use information on EMG muscle activation and the average cross-sectional area of the muscles and their maximal force generating capacity, our approach calculates a set of muscle forces that minimizes the difference between joint and muscle moments while minimizing overall muscle activity level. This approach accounts for the muscle force length and velocity dependency that cannot be accounted for if EMG is scaled to the maximal force generating capacity of the muscle. Second, the methodology for controlling tibial kinematics eliminates the need for manual and arbitrary tuning of the horizontal and vertical knee translation. In addition, it solves the problem of generating good tibial kinematics control inputs for simulations with feet, having more extreme dimensions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913490455">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913490455">7</xref></sup> Third, we present a strategy to calculate complete 3D joint kinematics. It is unique as the combined use of CT data with data from a 3D motion capture device allows extending the currently available data on joint rotations of selected foot bones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913490455">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411913490455"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411913490455"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411913490455"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913490455"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913490455">14</xref></sup> with joint translations that were not previously documented. These additional data are relevant for a profound validation of numerical models and for gaining more insight in foot biomechanics.</p>
<p>Our setup achieves very high control performance and repeatability of the inputs. Only two muscles with relatively low forces (M. flexor digitorum longus and M. flexor hallucis longus) show smaller values for R<sup>2</sup> and S compared with the other muscles. However, as their force magnitudes are only slightly higher than the measurement noise of the load cells, these parameters are bad indicators of control performance for these muscles, as the absolute deviation between the set point and applied force is small. The observed errors for the applied muscle forces will have very limited effects on joint kinematics and kinetics. It can therefore be concluded that all input parameters to the setup are well controlled and allow repeatable simulations of the stance phase of gait.</p>
<p>The measured hindfoot kinematics show acceptable correspondence to the golden standard for in vivo kinematics and kinetics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411913490455">20</xref></sup> comparable with the correspondence of published in vitro data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913490455">7</xref></sup> and even better for transverse plane rotations of the joints that were included in this study. This implies that the presented approach allows simulations with bone rotations in different planes, representative of normal gait. The most significant deviations were seen in the transverse plane for the talo-navicular and calcaneocuboid joints, which present opposite patterns compared with in vivo. This was also seen for rotations at the tibio-calcaneal joint for some feet that relates to the elevated vGRF as discussed hereafter.</p>
<p>For the vGRF and COP, we observed the typical change of force and position over stance in most feet. Only in one foot, increased midfoot loading was achieved during simulation, therefore shifting the COP immediately from the heel to the first metatarsal. In this foot, also the decrease of the vGRF at midstance is seen to be absent. Furthermore, one can observe abnormal ankle kinematics with a high initial plantarflexion at the ankle, followed by a limited motion into dorsiflexion and only limited plantarflexion at the end of stance. These abnormalities can be explained by an elevated tibia-ground angle (α in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913490455">Figure 3</xref>) at initial contact compared with the one assumed by the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913490455">Figure 3</xref>. Such an elevated tibia-ground angle will increase the slope of the foot with respect to the ground at heel contact and thus initial plantarflexion. At midstance, such an elevated angle would require the force plate to drop more. If not, this results in an increased vGRF and decreased dorsiflexion. This stresses the importance of a correct initial inclination of the tibia with respect to the ground at initial contact. A newer version of our gait simulator includes a mechanism that ensures the correct and repeatable positioning of the specimen at the beginning of the stance phase, in order to avoid such complications.</p>
<p>Despite the corresponding pattern of the vGRF with curves observed in vivo, we need to acknowledge that the magnitude of the vGRF is considerably higher than in vivo for the simulated BW. This is a consequence of slight inaccuracies in the control of force plate position (2.24 mm on average), which results in additional compression of the leg and foot. Due to the high structural stiffness of the leg and foot in the setup, this limited additional compression results in a considerable increase in the vGRF. However, as the error with respect to the desired position of the force plate is small, the effects on the kinematics in the sagittal plane are limited. On the other hand, this can explain the unexpected motion into abduction at the talo-navicular and calcaneocuboid joints. In order to further normalize the magnitude of the vGRF and associated kinematics, enhancement of the control of the force plate is currently being implemented.</p>
<p>Although the current results clearly demonstrate the ability to induce hindfoot kinematics comparable with previously published data with typical vGRF and COP patterns, some additional aspects need to be acknowledged. First, the applied muscle force magnitudes are below the physiological magnitudes observed in a normal adult population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411913490455">23</xref></sup> However, as cadaver integrity is of prior concern, forces are kept low, as is the case in all studies where dynamic in vitro experiments were performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913490455">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411913490455"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411913490455"/>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913490455"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913490455">14</xref></sup> As a consequence, there is a decrease in the ROM, and load transfer in the joints will be reduced, which means intra-articular pressures are reduced compared with in vivo. In contrast, motion patterns remain largely unaffected as the main muscle action remains unaffected. Second, also gait speed and acceleration are reduced compared with in vivo, as was also the case in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913490455">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411913490455"/>

Consequently, there is limited impact of these reduced forces of inertia on bone motion. On the other hand, there might be an effect on the viscoelastic behavior of the ligaments and other soft tissues and on the intra-articular pressures. However, previous studies have shown that experiments with clinical relevance are still possible despite these limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913490455">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411913490455"/>

In particular, we assume the knee and ankle joint axis to be fixed and all segments to be rigid. Furthermore, the setup has limited degrees of freedom to control knee movement as is the case in existing gait simulators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913490455">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411913490455">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913490455"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411913490455">5</xref></sup> In particular, our setup lacks to simulate the frontal and transverse plane motion that occurs at the knee and which was observed to be quite crucial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411913490455">24</xref></sup> However, as for the reduced forces, our results have shown that kinematics similar to in vivo can still be achieved despite these simplifications.</p>
<p>Other factors relate to aspects, common in all existing gait simulators, that is, the lack of activation of intrinsic foot musculature, altered soft tissue properties when compared with in vivo, the lack of neuromuscular control, and the lack of knowledge on specimen-specific muscle forces (which requires arbitrary tuning of these control inputs). Consequently, it is not possible to exactly reproduce the kinematics of the living subject for a particular specimen.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the correspondence of the kinematics and kinetics with in vivo data for a sample of specimens with varying dimensions shows the relevance and validity of including specimen-specific information for defining the control inputs. More specifically, this approach eliminates the need for arbitrary editing of the input for controlling tibial kinematics. In addition, it provides us with data that show comparable correspondence with in vivo data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411913490455">20</xref></sup> as that of the most recent data of in vitro gait simulations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913490455">7</xref></sup> and even better correspondence for the transverse plane rotations, despite the limited amount of degrees of freedom for controlling tibial kinematics in the presented setup. Therefore, the setup provides opportunities to evaluate the quality of numerical model predictions of the motion patterns for a particular specimen, to investigate the kinematic and kinetic behavior of implants and to perform clinical studies, similar to those presented in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913490455">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411913490455"/>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have developed a setup for dynamic in vitro gait simulation, integrating a unique approach for generating the tibial kinematics control input. In addition, we presented a methodology to reconstruct complete 3D joint kinematics, that is, both rotations and translations, and we presented these kinematic results for the tarsal joints in the foot.
