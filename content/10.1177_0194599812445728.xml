<abstract>
<p>The use of medical imaging is commonplace in children with otolaryngologic disease, with a not insignificant and increasing exposure to ionizing radiation from such diagnostic imaging. Radiation exposure imparts potential cancer risk, particularly in children, who have long life expectancies and are more sensitive to the adverse effects of ionizing radiation. We summarize these issues, with a focus on computed tomography (CT) in children. The otolaryngologist plays a key role optimizing the use and minimizing the risk of diagnostic imaging in children by ordering the correct test at the best time for the right reasons. In concert with radiology colleagues and informed parents, we can improve the safety of radiologic imaging for the children we diagnose and treat.</p>

<body>
<p>Advances in diagnostic imaging have benefited children with otolaryngologic disease, allowing shorter hospital stays, fewer invasive procedures, more targeted surgical procedures, and earlier and more precise diagnosis of neoplasms and congenital anomalies. With the use of such improved technology, concerns about exposure of children to ionizing radiation have recently come to the forefront.</p>
<p>Radiation exposure from medical sources accounts for about half of our total radiation exposure in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812445728">1</xref></sup> Radiation exposure from medical imaging has grown six-fold over the past 25 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812445728">2</xref></sup> These issues are particularly important for children, who have smaller target organs with potentially increased radiation dose per study, as well as life-long oncologic risk from early radiation exposure.</p>
<p>We need not look far to find concerns about the risks of diagnostic imaging. The lay press has detailed unsuspected overdosage of radiation from computed tomography (CT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812445728">3</xref></sup> The need for specific pediatric protocols for CT scans of children, as well as close monitoring of the technical specifications of equipment, have been emphasized. The medical community, led by our radiology colleagues, has been forthright in recognizing the risks of exposure to diagnostic radiation. Brenner et al, over 10 years ago, estimated that of the 600,000 children who have a single head or body CT scan before age 15 years, 500 might ultimately die of cancers that could be attributed to radiation from the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812445728">4</xref></sup> We discuss efforts to reduce the exposure of children to radiation from diagnostic imaging, with focus on the responsibilities of the otolaryngologist in such efforts.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599812445728">
<title>Radiation Dose Considerations and the Clinician</title>
<p>Ionizing radiation damages DNA and may result in the development of cancer or other consequences of genomic instability. The physics and biology of exposure to ionizing radiation is complex. Radiation dose measures the amount of energy absorbed by a unit mass of tissue, with the unit of dose exposure being the Gray (Gy). A typical abdominal CT may expose a patient to about 5 to 10 mGy. Body tissues vary in their sensitivity to radiation. For example, bone marrow is more radiosensitive than brain. Weighting factors for such differential radiosensitivities can be assigned to each tissue. The organ dose can be multiplied by the weighting factor for the exposed tissue, giving an organ effective dose. The organ effective doses are summed to calculate the total effective dose, which can be used to assess relative radiation risk. The unit of effective dose is the Seivert (Sv). A typical CT study may give an effective dose anywhere from &lt;1 to 30 mSv. As a reference, natural background radiation gives about 3.5 mSv per year of whole body exposure.</p>
<p>Direct epidemiologic evidence from human populations have demonstrated that 50 to 100 mSv as a protracted exposure or 10 to 50 mSv as an acute exposure increases the risk of cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812445728">5</xref></sup> Children have body tissues that are more radiosensitive than those of adults and usually have long life spans during which effects of radiation exposure can manifest. Calculation of the exact total effective dose for a given CT scan for a given patient is difficult. CT scan reports now provide the dose length product (DLP), which is the scan length multiplied by the CT dose index (CTDIvol). CTDIvol is a complex calculation using many CT parameters. While the CTDIvol and the DLP do not exactly represent the effective dose, in general, the larger the CTDIvol and/or DLP, the greater the radiation dose received by the patient. Extensive calculation by a radiation physicist is needed to arrive at the <italic>exact</italic> total effective dose for a particular patient.</p>
<p>What does the ordering physician need to know about radiation exposure, especially when treating children? It is important to order the right test at the right time for the right reason. The ordering physician should consider both the potential for optimal diagnosis as well as the potential radiation risks of an imaging study. The need for imaging must be placed in clinical context, with consideration of studies that do not use ionizing radiation, such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, when appropriate. Efforts to reduce radiation dose should include scanning only the indicated area using appropriate technical factors according to the ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable). The application of the ALARA principle to diagnostic imaging is a balance of an optimal diagnostic study that answers the clinical question with the use of the lowest possible dose exposure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0194599812445728">
<title>Safer Use of Computed Tomography</title>
<p>CT scans account for only 11% of imaging studies but produce about 70% of image-related radiation exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812445728">2</xref></sup> As many as 7 million CT scans are performed in children each year in the United States. Three strategies can reduce radiation exposure from CT scans: (1) ordering fewer CT scans, (2) using another imaging modality when possible, (3) reducing the radiation dose of each study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812445728">6</xref></sup> The considerations for use of CT scan early in the diagnostic algorithms for otolaryngologic disease in children are numerous and often justified. However, history and examination findings and considerations of therapeutic options may preclude the need for immediate imaging. For example, there is wide agreement that CT scans should not be performed for diagnosis of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis in children. The ideal timing of imaging should be considered as well. A temporal bone CT for a young child with stable mild-moderate sensorineural hearing loss might best be delayed until the unsedated child will lay still for high-resolution imaging.</p>
<p>Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging can avoid the ionizing radiation of CT scans in appropriate clinical situations, although the former lacks the anatomic detail of CT or MRI and the latter may require the use of sedation or general anesthesia for many children. Ultrasound can be used to help diagnosis neck abscess in young children prior to surgical drainage.</p>
<p>Dose reduction for CT imaging is an achievable goal. Current generation CT scanners often default to an automatic exposure-control mode, using a higher radiation dose than necessary to obtain the information desired. Instead, at the Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, the radiation exposure settings are calculated for each CT scan based on the patient weight, with defined pediatric and site-specific protocols that follow the ALARA principle.</p>
<p>While the superiority of CT scan over plain radiographs for pediatric sinus disease is beyond debate, the wide use of sinus CT scans makes “decision to scan” and the technical factors in performance fertile areas for potential radiation dose reduction. In 1997, Kearney et al compared quality of sinus CT scans performed at 40mAs and 60mAs and found no reduction in diagnostic quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812445728">7</xref></sup> Mulkens et al compared conventional sinus x-rays to multidetector sinus CT scans at reduced mAs in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812445728">8</xref></sup> A reduction of radiation dose is possible for pediatric sinus CT scans because the key air, bone, and soft tissue components are so different in densities. CT images were diagnostic at doses as low as 16 mAs to 23 mAs. These authors found low dose multidetector sinus CT scans give higher diagnostic accuracy than plain sinus films at comparable radiation doses.</p>
<p>A patient had coronal sinus imaging performed first using previously “standard” dosing of 120kVp (kilovolt peak) and 150mAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812445728"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>) and again with 20mAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812445728"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). While the images obtained at reduced mAs show more “grainy” soft tissue, the bony detail and soft tissue air interfaces are quite similar. Since radiation dose correlates linearly with mAs, the CT performed at 20mAs reduces radiation exposure almost seven-fold. Radiation exposure can also be decreased with the use of newer scanners that allow faster scan times and by limiting studies to the region of interest by scanning just above and below the area of pathology.</p>

<p>We have detailed methods for dose reduction in sinus CT imaging of children, but impact on “the decision to scan” moves more slowly. The excellent diagnostic information provided by sinus CT scan is recognized by the many pediatric generalists and specialists. The challenge for the otolaryngologist and others who treat children with refractory sinus disease is to disseminate the information about when these images are really needed—for the diagnostic dilemmas, the surgical candidates, the complicated cases, and those with suspected anatomic anomalies.</p>

<title>Resources for Safer Imaging of Children</title>
<p>As early as 1993, the American College of Radiology (ACR) developed the concept of Appropriateness Criteria for diagnostic imaging modalities. These evidence-based guidelines can assist providers in selecting the best radiologic imaging modality for a given medical condition. These Appropriateness Criteria, developed by expert panels, contain directive comments as well as information about relative radiation exposure, and are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://acr.org/ac">acr.org/ac</ext-link>. Bautista et al reported that consultation with a radiologist is the resource used by the majority of physicians when choosing imaging techniques, but the ACR appropriateness criteria are used by few.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812445728">9</xref></sup> Additionally, otolaryngologists should become familiar with the imaging protocols at their referral facilities that image children. Discussion of the “questions to be answered” (otolaryngologist) and the strategies/technical challenges (radiologist) will assist in selecting the correct pediatric protocol to limit radiation dose.</p>
<p>How should we counsel parents and guardians about risks of radiation exposure of children during medical imaging? A helpful resource created by the Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagegently.org">imagegently.org</ext-link>. This Web site contains information for patients and their parents, as well as information for referring physicians, radiologists, medical physicists, and radiology technologists. Counseling of parents about imaging studies and radiation improves their understanding without adversely affecting the ability to obtain necessary tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812445728">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Safer imaging of children is a shared responsibility (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812445728"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). We must order the best imaging test for the appropriate indications at the right time. While we focus on CT scans here, these principles apply to all radiologic studies in children, such as fluoroscopic imaging or interventional radiologic procedures. Radiologists can advise us by screening our requests to image, and they have provided us with evidenced-based guidelines to help choose studies. Radiologists can also manage technical performance issues and track radiation dosing by individual patient, patient populations, imaging modality, and facility.</p>

<p>Our patients, and the parents/guardians of the children we treat, should be empowered to understand why imaging is needed, what alternatives exist to the use of ionizing radiation, and what the risks of imaging may be—including hard-to-quantify oncologic risks. They should have access to images and results to avoid repeat studies. Otolaryngologists should always consider the appropriateness of imaging, assuring that the best modality is being ordered, that the imaging actually influences management, and that the timing of imaging is ideal. These considerations include using the lowest necessary radiation dose, using pediatric-specific protocols, imaging only the affected areas of interest, and using tests that avoid ionizing radiation when possible.</p>
