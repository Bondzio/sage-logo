<abstract>
<p>The recent heritage literature abounds with criticism of UNESCO and the system set up under its World Heritage Convention. Much of this criticism would be better directed at the States Parties to the Convention, most of which operate in ways that serve their own national interest. Some, however, give mixed signals and demonstrate behaviour that seems inconsistent to the outside observer. Australia is an example of such a State Party, having been a leader in two seemingly opposed policy shifts within the World Heritage system during the last 15 years. On one hand, since the late 1990s Kakadu crisis it has sought to re-focus the World Heritage system on the conservation of Outstanding Universal Value to the detriment of important societal issues which the system could address more concertedly, such as the achievement of cultural dialogue and the entrenchment of human rights. On the other hand, Australia has been a principal advocate for greater involvement of Indigenous peoples in World Heritage nomination and management. The extent to which Australian governments have learnt to deal more sensitively with their Indigenous citizens is shown in the current development of the World Heritage nomination of Cape York. Australia’s apparently inconsistent behaviour within the World Heritage system reflects tensions within Australia’s internal governance arrangements and also at the interface between global governance and state governance. Clearer recognition of such tensions is necessary if a better understanding of the operations of the World Heritage system is to be achieved and if ways to improve the World Heritage system are to be found.</p>

<body>
<p>The recent heritage literature abounds with criticism of UNESCO and the system set up under its World Heritage Convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 1972</xref>). Much of this criticism would be better directed at the States Parties to the Convention rather than at UNESCO, the Convention, the <italic>Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2011</xref>) or, indeed, the World Heritage Committee’s Secretariat at UNESCO headquarters in Paris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605313476783">Logan, 2012b</xref>: 113–116). The World Heritage system is dependent on the goodwill and collaboration of the States Parties but, while the States Parties publicly support UNESCO and its World Heritage objectives, most ultimately operate according to their own national interests. Responsibility for implementing the Convention and managing the World Heritage program lies with the World Heritage Committee, an elected subset of 21 States Parties, meeting annually to inscribe new sites on the World Heritage List, examine reports on the state of conservation of inscribed properties, request States Parties to take action when the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) for which the properties have been inscribed is under threat, and to declare seriously threatened properties as World Heritage in Danger, or if the OUV has been irredeemably lost, to delist them. On the evidence of recent World Heritage Committee meetings in Brasilia (2010), Paris (2011) and St Petersburg (2012), it appears that nationalist interests have risen to new heights in the decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605313476783">Logan, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469605313476783">Meskell, in press</xref>). This is a situation about which UNESCO can do little because of its character as an International Governmental Organization (IGO). It is not a monolithic agent and it has no real policing powers. Rather, UNESCO is made up of 193 independent states that are jealous of their national sovereignty and can be highly resistant to what they see as interference from UNESCO and its Advisory Bodies – the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM).</p>
<p>To the outside observer, however, the behaviour of some States Parties, especially when debating and voting on the World Heritage Committee, often seems not only contrary to the principles embedded in the Convention but also inconsistent, if not downright muddled in terms of their own strategies towards World Heritage. Australia is an example of such a State Party, having been a leader in two seemingly opposed policy shifts within the World Heritage system during the last 15 years. On one hand, since the late 1990s it has sought to re-focus the system on the conservation of OUV to the detriment of important societal issues that the World Heritage system could address more concertedly, such as the achievement of cultural dialogue and the entrenchment of human rights. On the other hand, Australia has been a principal advocate for greater involvement of the world’s indigenous peoples in World Heritage nomination and management. This study explains the apparent inconsistency in these positions as a reflection of tensions occurring within Australia’s internal governance arrangements and political, bureaucratic and professional circles, as well as tensions occurring at the interface between global governance and state governance.</p>
<p>The article tracks Australia’s behaviour as a State Party since the initial nomination of Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory in 1981 to the program now being undertaken to determine whether the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, or large parts of it, should be nominated. At the outset, Australia’s early and continuing support for the World Heritage Convention and the system established under it should be noted. It was the seventh state to adhere to the Convention and, as of December 2012, it had 19 properties on the World Heritage List. Of these, three were Cultural sites, four were Mixed sites (including one Cultural Landscape) and 12 were Natural sites. Two of these properties – the Kakadu and Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Parks – were first listed as Natural sites and later reinscribed as Mixed sites in recognition of their Cultural values. Fourteen of the properties have local communities whose lives feel the impact of World Heritage listing. Such communities are mostly Indigenous, made up of Aboriginal people who believe passionately that they have ‘obligations to care for our country, to look after <italic>djang</italic> (sacred sites), to communicate with our ancestors and to teach all of this to future generations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313476783">Oviedo, 2012</xref>: 63; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313476783">Smyth, 2012</xref>: 5). According to current thinking in the World Heritage system as reflected in the Operational Guidelines, these communities should have been meaningfully involved in the nomination process that led to the World Heritage listing of their country – a country for which they have been custodians for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Australia’s Indigenous peoples were not, however, adequately involved in its early World Heritage nominations. The lack of meaningful engagement with the traditional owners in decision-making about setting aside part of the Kakadu World Heritage property for uranium mining led to bitter conflict between the local Mirrar people and the Australian Government. This exclave comprised four excisions for mining and related purposes: Ranger (mined since 1980), Jabiru (township site), Jabiluka (site of the dispute that erupted in 1998) and Koongarra (at the southern end of the exclave near the highly significant Nourlangie rock art site). The conflict spilled over onto the World Heritage Committee stage and threatened to weaken the World Heritage in Danger mechanism – indeed, the credibility of the whole World Heritage system. Nevertheless, Australia appears to have come a long way in the last decade towards more serious engagement, albeit along a very bumpy road. In the Cape York case both the Australian and the Queensland governments have adopted a rights-based approach designed to enable local Indigenous peoples to decide whether or not the nomination process would proceed.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1469605313476783"><title>Kakadu National Park</title>
<p>When the Australian Government moved in the early 1980s to nominate Kakadu National Park for World Heritage inscription, it thought it had the agreement of the Aboriginal leaders both to the nomination and to the mining of uranium in the exclave. The Northern Land Council (NLC), an independent statutory body established under the <italic>Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, 1976</italic> to represent the traditional owners, had indeed signed away mineral rights at Jabiluka to Pan Continental in 1982. These rights were subsequently acquired by Energy Resources of Australia Pty Ltd (ERA). Uranium had been mined at Ranger since 1980 and plans to develop another mine nearby had been put on hold by the Australian Labor Party (ALP) governments under Prime Ministers Bob Hawke (1983–91) and Paul Keating (1991–96). With the election of the conservative Liberal-National Coalition government under Prime Minister John Howard in 1996, the lid was lifted and ERA’s Jabiluka expansion plans were endorsed.</p>
<p>However, from the point of view of the Mirrar-Gundjehmi clan as represented by its Senior Traditional Owner, Yvonne Margarula, the 1982 agreement was unfairly achieved. It has been said that her father, Toby Gangale, was simply worn down by the negotiations: at the final meeting, where the Kakadu traditional owners were asked whether they actually wanted the new mine to go ahead or not, he is reported to have said ‘I'm tired now, I can’t fight any more’ and that this was taken as consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469605313476783">Katona, 1997</xref>). Succeeding her father in 1989, Yvonne Margarula insists that the Mirrar have consistently opposed uranium mining in their country (Mirrar, n.d.). They were – and remain – particularly anxious about leakage of contaminated water from the mine into the local stream system. They were also concerned that tunnelling, road-making and the use of explosives and heavy vehicles would damage fragile and important sacred sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605313476783">Australia ICOMOS, 2000</xref>). Further, the Mirrar insisted that their culturally significant sites ‘must be protected, not “managed” as part of a mining project’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605313476783">Gundjehmi Aboriginal Corporation, 2001</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>Plans by the Australian Government in the late 1990s to allow ERA to expand uranium mining led to national protests, including at Jabiluka itself where 5000 people protested and 543 were arrested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605313476783">Murdoch, 2004</xref>). It led, too, to the Mirrar breaking with normal UNESCO protocols and taking its case directly to the World Heritage Committee in Paris. Acting through the Gundjehmi Aboriginal Corporation, the Mirrar asked the Committee to send a mission of experts from the IUCN and ICOMOS to investigate the potential impact on their natural and cultural heritage and to put Kakadu National Park on the World Heritage in Danger list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605313476783">Aplin, 2007</xref>: 34). Howard’s government was furious at being by-passed in this way. Forced to accept the mission, it argued nevertheless that ‘world’s best practice’ would be followed at the Jabiluka mine, that fears of physical damage to cultural sites were unrealistic or exaggerated and that objections based on threats to traditional belief systems were novel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605313476783">Australia ICOMOS, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The World Heritage Committee held a single-item Extraordinary Session on Kakadu in July 1999 and did not recommend ‘in-danger’ listing. It did, however, reiterate its concern about scientific uncertainties, serious threats to living cultural values and lack of progress with a cultural management plan for Jabiluka, and it asked the Australian Government to provide updated information on a series of actions to resolve these matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 1999</xref>). By mid-2000, it was clear that the Australian Government was making no progress in opening up consultations with the traditional owners and it was said to be suppressing scientific reports that indicated potential damage to the site’s cultural values by dust and vibrations from the proposed mine (Uranium Research Group, n.d.: 13). Frustrated by what they saw as stonewalling by the national government and its siding with the mining company, the traditional owners again put pressure directly on UNESCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469605313476783">Krishnapallai, 2000</xref>). By coincidence the World Heritage Committee was holding its 24th Session in Cairns, northern Queensland, in November 2000. Here the dispute played out in full view of the Committee, Advisory Bodies, other State Party delegates and the media, especially when Yvonne Margarula was invited to address the Committee. In the foyer outside, Indigenous people from round the world were meeting in a parallel session, making the more general point that Indigenous people everywhere were not being treated fairly by the World Heritage system. Indeed, they were mounting a campaign for the establishment of a new Advisory Body, to be known as the World Heritage Indigenous Peoples’ Council of Experts, commonly known by its acronym WHIPCOE.</p>
<p>The World Heritage Committee at its Twenty-fifth Session in Helsinki in 2001 rejected the recommendation from the Mirrar and chose not to put Kakadu on the In-Danger List (UNESCO, 2001e: 30–31). With tensions dissipating, the Mirrar agreed to consider how they might go about mapping their cultural heritage if at some time in the future they thought this was worth doing. At the workshop I ran in 2002 as Australia ICOMOS President with the assistance of Nicholas Hall from Environment Australia, the Mirrar listened carefully but subsequently chose not to undertake such a process. Meanwhile, Rio Tinto, now the majority shareholder of ERA, announced it would postpone the Jabiluka project indefinitely, blaming low commodity prices and Aboriginal opposition. In April 2001, its chairman, Sir Robert Wilson, announced to shareholders in Sydney that ‘We don’t believe Jabiluka can be developed without the consent of both the Northern Land Council and … the traditional owners of the area. And clearly, at this stage, that consent is nowhere near forthcoming’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605313476783">Schultz, 2001</xref>). A clean-up process began in 2003 with backfilling of the Jabiluka mine. On 1 January 2005 the mining company, the Mirrar-Gundjehmi Aboriginal people and the NLC signed the <italic>Jabiluka Long-Term Care and Maintenance Agreement</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605313476783">ERA, 2005</xref>), giving the traditional owners a veto on any future development at the mine site. In 2007, Rio Tinto’s chief executive, Tom Albanese, introduced a new concept into the discourse relating to Kakadu’s management when he declared that ‘We have for a long time made the commitment that further development would be subject to the <italic>prior informed consent</italic> of the traditional landowners’ (<italic>The Age</italic>, 27 July 2007, my italics), a principle that becomes more critical later in the story of Australia’s engagement with its Indigenous citizens in heritage matters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1469605313476783"><title>Governance and politics</title>
<p>More detailed accounts of the Jabiluka conflict can be found in the works of S.J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605313476783">Maswood (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605313476783">Graeme Aplin (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605313476783">2007)</xref> and the then Communications Officer for the Gundjehmi Aboriginal Corporation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605313476783">Justin O’Brien (2003)</xref>. What is important for the story being told in this study, however, is the way in which the Jabiluka case highlights the critical importance of governance and political factors in understanding heritage protection as cultural practice. In the past, heritage professionals have commonly seen conservation as either a technical or a management issue – a matter of applying the best or latest scientific solution or the appropriate management strategy to preserve or restore an artefact, monument or site. As I have argued elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469605313476783">Logan, 2008</xref>: 441, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605313476783">2012a</xref>: 241), this was never true: heritage protection has always been about resource management and resource allocation and, therefore, has always had a powerful political dimension and a governance context. With the focus shifting towards intangible forms of heritage – ‘living heritage embodied in people’ – efforts to protect heritage are more likely to run up against what many people consider to be infringements of human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605313476783">Logan, 2007a</xref>: 37).</p>
<p>Governance arrangements within Australia’s Indigenous population are complex. Insofar as Kakadu is concerned, there are 19 clans, often speaking different languages and in some cases upholding different cultural traditions but always attached to their own ‘country’ and undertaking heritage management as a customary obligation. The Mirrar-Gundjehmi clan led by Senior Traditional Owner Yvonne Margarula is small, numbering fewer than 30 adults and 20 children in recent times. It represents a tiny fraction of the total 30,000 Aboriginal people scattered among 200 communities across the ‘Top End’ of the Northern Territory. It comes under the NLC where, at times, Margarula has had to stand up for the interests of her clan and country against those NLC members favouring uranium mining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469605313476783">Australian Parliament, 2011</xref>). Her clan’s numbers contrast even more strikingly with the total Australian population of around 19 million at the time of the Kakadu crisis, raising fundamental questions about the nature of democratic government and the status of minority groups, Indigenous and otherwise, within the body politic. To what extent should the views of a small minority hold sway over national policy-making? When does the majority prevail? What is the basis in philosophical principle and legislative practice for deciding such questions?</p>
<p>Of course Prime Minister John Howard thought that he, too, was talking for country – the nation-state – as Australia’s elected leader. Jabiluka was worth AUD12 billion to the Australian economy. Australia had 24 percent of the world’s known uranium deposits and was selling to the USA, Japan and eight other countries. During a meeting I had as Australia ICOMOS President with Roger Beale, Secretary of Environment Australia, he explained that the government was concerned by the potentially enormous compensation claims it might face if existing uranium customers were lost as a result of Kakadu being In-Danger listed. What is clear is that the government was furious and embarrassed that the case had been taken out of its sole jurisdiction. This was taken as an infringement of national sovereignty and a restriction on its powers as a democratically elected government, and it strongly opposed the intervention of UNESCO and ICOMOS. During its time in office, the Howard government earned the reputation of being suspicious of international treaties and related obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605313476783">Aplin, 2004</xref>: 166). It was certainly edgy on the matter when Yvonne Margarula wrote to the World Heritage Committee in April 2001 that the Australian Government ‘continues to be in serious breach of its international obligations under the World Heritage Convention and … under international human rights law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2001a</xref>: Annex IV). Roger Beale replied that ‘the Australian Government firmly rejects any suggestion that it has been, or is, in breach of its obligations under the World Heritage Convention or other pertinent international law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2001a</xref>: Annex V).</p>
<p>In comparison with the ALP and especially the Australian Greens party, the Howard government was seen by the Australian community as less environmentally conscious and more strongly pro-development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605313476783">Logan, 2007b</xref>: 208–210). Australia’s most distinguished archaeologist, John Mulvaney (2007: ch. 14), describes the government as subscribing to an ‘unfortunate isolationist nationalism’ that put its international heritage policies at variance from previous administrations. Mulvaney sees the government’s reaction as one of ‘no-holds-barred’ from the outset. During the mission of experts’ visit:<disp-quote>
<p>It disparaged the expertise of the prestigious committee, having ensured that during its visit to Kakadu the committee’s contact with critics was minimal. As a person giving evidence to that committee I can vouch for the contrivances employed by the host department to achieve that end. Nations on the World Heritage executive committee were extensively lobbied while taxpayers funded a three-week visit to Paris by the minister and several senior staffers. They secured a reversal of the recommendation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605313476783">Mulvaney, 2007</xref>: ch. 14)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, there were significant divisions within the government, firstly between the ‘wets’ (moderates) and the ‘dries’ (hard-line conservatives) and secondly between those with a special commitment to environmental and Indigenous issues and those with little personal interest or empathy. At the hub of much of the Kakadu debate was Senator Robert Hill, Australia’s longest-serving Minister for the Environment. Clearly dedicated to the environment and a conscientious and effective manager, he achieved his mission to establish the 1999 <italic>Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation</italic> (EPBC) <italic>Act</italic>, a fundamental overhaul of Australia’s environmental laws that came into force mid-2000 and still sets the legislative basis for Australian Government actions today. Hill was able to develop sufficient rapport with State and Territory environment and planning ministers that for the first time cultural heritage protection could be seen as an integrated and hierarchical operation across Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605313476783">Logan, 2007b</xref>: 213). This arrangement allowed other major changes, including the establishment of a national heritage list giving statutory protection to registered places. On cultural heritage matters and the question of uranium mining at Jabiluka, however, Hill was far less adventurous. Here, his actions were tempered by the internal politics of the government cabinet where Howard and other ministers were arguing to expand uranium exports to China and India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469605313476783">Medcalf, 2011</xref>: 4–5).</p>
<p>The Jabiluka case also revealed the difficulty UNESCO faces being an International Governmental Organization (IGO) made up of Member States run by independent governments which resist anything that seems like interference in their internal affairs. Indeed, the General Assembly of States Parties to the World Heritage Convention is itself an IGO within the UNESCO IGO. The World Heritage program being so popular, only five of UNESCO’s 195 Member States have currently not ratified the Convention. While lying within the ‘family’ of UNESCO structures and working within parameters set by the World Heritage Convention 1972, the General Assembly and its elected subset, the World Heritage Committee, have their own decision-making powers. The difficulty is that, being IGOs, they are rarely openly critical of a Member State or State Party and much reliance has to be placed on diplomatic manoeuvers to achieve difficult ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605313476783">Logan, 2007a</xref>: 48). As previously noted, the States Parties operate according to their perception of their own national needs and they can resist what they see as interference from the Advisory Bodies. This is reflected in the high rate of rejection of the Advisory Body recommendations at World Heritage Committee sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605313476783">Meskell, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In the Kakadu case, ICOMOS was clearly seen by the Australian Government as a chief enemy. This impacted on dealings between the government and Australia ICOMOS, which reached a low point in 1998–9. As incoming President in late 1999, I found it necessary to remind the Environment Secretary that Australia ICOMOS was a chapter of Paris-based ICOMOS and independent of the national government. During and for a while after the Jabiluka crisis it was believed in Australia ICOMOS circles that several of its leading members had been put on a ‘not-to-be-employed’ list and that the government had decided never to accept another ICOMOS international mission. One senior officer in Environment Australia’s heritage section did suggest to me, however, that the government might be prepared to work with Australia ICOMOS, as, indeed, it has been.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1469605313476783"><title>Australia and the World Heritage in Danger mechanism</title>
<p>The Kakadu crisis thus revolved around conceptions of national sovereignty and the Howard government’s perceptions of interference by the global heritage bodies. The government vigorously resisted attempts to put Kakadu on the In-Danger List, lobbying in Kyoto, Paris and other national capitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605313476783">Australia ICOMOS, 2000</xref>). At its July 1999 Extraordinary Session on Kakadu, when the Committee decided not to inscribe the site on the In-Danger List, it emphasized ‘respect … [for] the sovereignty of States on whose territory the cultural and natural heritage is situated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 1999</xref>). The Committee did, however, also note that under the Convention ‘States Parties […] recognise that such heritage constitutes a world heritage for whose protection it is the duty of the international community as a whole to co-operate’.</p>
<p>The crucial issue in this protracted and bitter debate was whether the World Heritage Committee could place an inscribed site onto the World Heritage in Danger List without the consent of the relevant State Party. For the next three years, Australia led a campaign to remove this power from the Committee and in so doing became seen by many in UNESCO, the Committee and the World Heritage Centre as threatening the credibility of the World Heritage program, which was already facing other credibility problems, notably the World Heritage List’s Eurocentrism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469605313476783">Labadi, 2005</xref>). This set Australia as the World Heritage ‘bad boy’, a reputation that embarrassed many Australians working in the cultural heritage field and that led subsequently to efforts by some in politics, in the heritage bureaucracy in Canberra and in Australia ICOMOS to undo the damage.</p>
<p>The issue surfaced dramatically at the Cairns 2000 World Heritage Committee meeting. Kakadu was not the only property on the agenda where the issue was relevant. Through the 1990s, the Nepalese Government had been resisting several attempts by ICOMOS and World Heritage Centre professionals to put the Kathmandu Valley property on the In-Danger List, fearing the negative impact this was likely to have on its tourism industry. At the Cairns session, the Nepalese case came up first. The Australian Government’s representatives supported Nepal’s case and in doing so took the opportunity to rehearse arguments it was going to make with regard to Kakadu. This forced the World Heritage Committee to call onto the stage UNESCO’s Legal Advisor who admitted that the relevant Article 6 of the World Heritage Convention was indeed ambiguous on this issue. He agreed to take legal counsel and to report back to the next World Heritage Committee meeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605313476783">IUCN, 2009</xref>: 37).</p>
<p>The Australian Government under Howard remained resolute. According to a newspaper report, its delegation, headed by the Environment Secretary, had gone to Cairns to push for the right to veto World Heritage places being In-Danger listed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605313476783">Ryan and Reid, 2000</xref>). Another report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469605313476783">Miller, 2000</xref>) claimed that in fact the delegates were to propose not only the veto power but also reducing the status of the Advisory Bodies and restricting the monitoring of World Heritage sites to government agencies alone. The proposal was to have been presented as an alternative to the recommendations from a formal international working party on revising the Operational Guidelines. The latter newspaper report indicated that only last minute pressure from other Committee members had led the government to downgrade its proposal to an ‘information sheet not for discussion at this meeting’.</p>
<p>The Australian Government nevertheless continued to argue for constraining the Committee’s power, including at the Committee’s 26th session in Budapest in June 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2002</xref>: 11). Here the debate was intense but inconclusive, with the legal issues concerning the In-Danger listing being postponed to a Sixth Extraordinary Session of the World Heritage Committee to be held at UNESCO Headquarters in March 2003. Legal opinion presented to this Paris meeting supported the interpretation that the Committee could act if necessary without the prior agreement of the State Party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2003a</xref>). The debate revealed a three-way split among Committee members and official observer delegations. The United Kingdom, India, South Africa, China, Egypt, Russia and the United States supported the Australian position, the Egyptian delegate arguing that ‘the State Party has full sovereignty … [and] the Convention is there to support the State Party’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2003b</xref>: 23). The Observer Delegation of America ‘underlined that they made it clear during the drafting of the Convention that nothing in the text should result in the loss of a nation’s sovereign control over the resources within its borders’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2003b</xref>: 24). Seven States Parties spoke against the Australian position, as did the IUCN and ICOMOS. Lebanon argued that, if the Committee lost this power, it ‘would be reduced to a “recording machine” inscribing sites on the World Heritage List for eternity. What was at stake was the credibility of the Convention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2003b</xref>: 25). A small third group argued for further consideration of the matter.</p>
<p>Finally, however, the decision went against Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2003c</xref>). By this time the issue in relation to Kakadu had already been resolved, but the decision meant that the World Heritage Committee was now able to put the Kathmandu Valley on the In-Danger List against the wishes of the Nepalese Government. The Australian Government was, however, clearly disappointed and continued its efforts to shift the system in the direction it wanted, especially to push for a very narrow focus on OUV. It followed a strategy of what Joseph King, a senior professional at ICCROM, has called the ‘unbundling’ of the way in which the World Heritage Committee examines nominations and state of conservation reports. The Committee no longer looks at inscribed properties in the more holistic way it had come to do; instead, protecting the OUV has become the exclusive focus of activities conducted under the World Heritage Convention while other matters, such as human rights, are now seen as dealt with by other conventions and charters (personal communication, 31 August 2012). This ‘unbundling’ of OUV from the other values of places, while dressed up as a move towards best international practice, can be understood as part of a political strategy to reduce future threats of In-Danger listing.</p>
<p>This strategy was followed doggedly in Committee debates at Budapest and elsewhere, including the ‘Future of the Convention’ discussions outlined later in this article. It also impacted on efforts to simplify and make the Operational Guidelines more user-friendly. Here again, Australia attempted to insert the notion that In-Danger listing required State Party consent. Although these attempts failed, the Australian intervention appears to have led to a large section of the guidelines relating to In-Danger listing not being revised at all and to the adoption of more complex language in other parts. Thus, while at one level the Kakadu crisis seemed to have ended by the mid-2000s, for the World Heritage system the continuing legacy of Kakadu has been the shift in the World Heritage Committee’s focus away from ‘place’ and towards the narrower protection of OUV. Complicating World Heritage matters further was the emergence of another challenge from Australia’s, and other States Parties’, Indigenous citizens – their advocacy for the creation of WHIPCOE. Again divisions occurred within the State Party ranks and, in Australia, within government, political parties and the heritage bureaucracy and profession.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1469605313476783"><title>Australia and WHIPCOE</title>
<p>The 1972 World Heritage Convention does not refer specifically to Indigenous peoples or to the importance of heritage places to them. The Convention does, however, refer to links between people and their environment. In an address to New York University in 2002, Sarah Titchen, an Australian archaeologist who was in charge of the Policy and Statutory Implementation Unit at the World Heritage Centre, noted that the Convention uses the language current in 1972 to refer also to the ‘combined works of nature and man’ as part of the world’s heritage. She saw ‘tremendous potential’ for World Heritage conservation to contribute to the cultural survival of Indigenous peoples and for traditional knowledge to be used as the basis for an environmentally sustainable future. But UNESCO knows, she added, that Indigenous people are not always consulted when a site on their traditional lands is nominated for World Heritage listing, when management plans are drawn up for the site or when public works are proposed on their traditional lands, even if that area is inscribed as a World Heritage property.<disp-quote>
<p>We also know that there are situations when Indigenous peoples have been actually physically removed from protected areas as a way of justifying inscription of an area on the World Heritage list as a place of natural importance … There are also examples of Indigenous peoples being restricted from practising traditional hunting, gathering, land use and trading practices as they are said to disturb the ecological balance particularly of natural World Heritage areas. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469605313476783">Titchen, 2002</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>If UNESCO in Paris knew these things, they were even clearer to the Indigenous people living in communities around the world affected by the World Heritage system. Their indignation reached the point in 2000 that a group of representatives held the aforementioned ‘Forum of Indigenous Peoples’ in the foyer of the Cairns convention centre during the World Heritage Committee session. Committee representatives from Australia, Canada and New Zealand who attended the Forum conveyed to the larger gathering the Forum’s concerns about the lack of meaningful involvement in World Heritage processes and presented a petition from the Forum in which it asked the Committee to:<disp-quote>
<p>… facilitate the establishment of a World Heritage Indigenous Peoples Council of Experts (WHIPCOE) pursuant to the provisions of Section 10(3) of the World Heritage Convention, a body that would bring new competencies and expertise to complement other expert groups, to support the objectives of the World Heritage Committee in the provision of expert Indigenous advice on the holistic knowledge, traditions and cultural values of Indigenous Peoples relative to the implementation of the World Heritage Convention, including current operational guidelines. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605313476783">Forum of Indigenous Peoples, 2000</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the discussion that followed, Australia, supported by other Committee members, suggested that the World Heritage Centre follow up on the Forum’s recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469605313476783">Logan, 2001</xref>). This was adopted by the Committee and it was agreed that a feasibility report should be presented to the 25th session of the Committee’s operational subset, the World Heritage Bureau, to be held in Paris in June 2001. The Committee Chair, Australia’s Peter King, proposed a small working group be formed comprising Indigenous representatives and interested State Parties. Australia, Canada and New Zealand once again stepped forward to work with the Secretariat. Their report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2001b</xref>: Annex 1) was duly presented to the Bureau by the Australian and Canadian representatives on the working group and was followed by comments from the then-Director of the World Heritage Centre, Francesco Bandarin. In the ensuing debate, Thailand’s delegate expressed the view that ‘there were only a few countries in the world where interventions by such a Council may be needed, and that internal agreements among the heritage authorities and the indigenous communities themselves would be more appropriate in such cases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2001b</xref>: Annex 1: 3). By contrast, the delegate of Australia argued that ‘the WHIPCOE proposal could be regarded as the most important initiative to have derived from the twenty-fourth session of the Committee (Cairns, 2000)’ and that ‘the issues being addressed were of importance to Australia as a nation and to all people working to protect the treasury of our global heritage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2001b</xref>: Annex 1: 5–6).</p>
<p>The debate concluded with the Bureau adopting the Australian line and expressing its support in principle for the WHIPCOE concept to be discussed at the Committee’s 25th session in Helsinki in December 2001. The Bureau set up a new working group comprising Australia, Belize, Canada, Ecuador, the United States, ICOMOS, IUCN and ICCROM and requested that a circular letter be sent to all States Parties and Advisory Bodies seeking comments on the WHIPCOE proposal. As Meskell (2013) shows, the responses to the circular letter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2001b</xref>) reveal nascent resistance, with France and Finland listing a series of legal, financial and procedural issues to be resolved and Israel stressing ‘the importance of defining the term “indigenous” before bestowing a mandate on such a body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2001c</xref>). Nevertheless, the working group continued its work, conducting a workshop in Winnipeg in November 2001 hosted by Parks Canada and with the UN High Commission for Human Rights (UNHCHR) and Yachay Wasi, a Peru-based NGO concerned with Inca culture and the rights of Indigenous peoples, as observers. The Winnipeg meeting reported favourably on the WHIPCOE concept to the Helsinki session of the Committee and asked for a small amount of funding to cover a second planning meeting.</p>
<p>But at Helsinki the initiative stalled. Herb Stovel, then Unit Director of the Human Settlements Unit at ICCROM, described the day the proposal was dealt with by the Committee as the saddest in the long time he had spent working on World Heritage matters at ICOMOS and ICCROM (personal communication J. King, 22 May 2012). Another Canadian supporter of the WHIPCOE initiative, Christina Cameron, felt the same: ‘My Aboriginal friend [Josie Weninger] presented the proposal and stood on the podium for over an hour as country after country threw cold water on the proposal’. Joseph King, a member of the ICCROM delegation, remembers the presentation as being very well made but followed by a number of States Parties taking the floor who, ‘after giving very glowing formalities complimenting the presentation, then proceeded to rip the idea to shreds’ (personal communication, 22 May 2012). An anonymous informant suggests that the World Heritage Centre Director missed the opportunity to intervene, leaving the WHIPCOE proposal to be rejected. The Committee merely recognized that the issue of Indigenous involvement was important and suggested that like-minded States Parties and Indigenous communities form a network as a basis of exchange of views and research collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469605313476783">Titchen, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The Helsinki discussion is not well represented in the documentation publicly available from UNESCO. According to Joseph King, the key issue seemed to be that:<disp-quote>
<p>… some State Parties were uncomfortable with the whole notion of giving some of their populations a potential special status. The idea of what constitutes ‘indigenous’ is a very complex one, and many countries did not seem to want to confront it. (personal communication J. King, 22 May 2012)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A source who wishes to remain anonymous remembers China and India as the two States Parties most strongly opposed to the proposal. The spokesperson for China apparently read a long statement that seemed to have been prepared by lawyers, while India said categorically that there were no indigenous peoples in Asia. King recalls that a number of African delegations also spoke strongly against the proposal. He also remembers that the States Parties supporting the idea included Canada, Australia and the USA. He found this interesting but not entirely surprising:<disp-quote>
<p>It seemed that the countries with more clearly defined indigenous populations did not have a problem with the idea while those where the concept was not as clear or might shift balances of power seemed to be against. (personal communication, 22 May 2012)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the end, the Committee did not approve the idea of the council or the funds to explore the idea further. King concludes that ‘I don't think any of us was expecting such a strong reaction… so we were all a bit stunned at the end of the debate’. Perhaps they had been naively optimistic and missed the warning sign offered by the Thailand delegate at the World Heritage Bureau meeting in June 2001, when he cautioned that ‘indigenous issues are a domestic, national question, and best handled on that level’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2001d</xref>: 2). Cameron probably sums up the disenchantment of all the WHIPCOE proponents at the Helsinki World Heritage session when she says that ‘It was a moment when I realized the fragility of nation states and what they will do when threatened’ (personal communication C. Cameron, 24 August 2012).</p>
<p>With the failure of this particular initiative, other avenues to advance Indigenous involvement had to be found. Tumu Te Heu Heu, the Paramount Chief of the Ngati Tuwharetoa people of New Zealand, was present in Helsinki and it was under his presidency at the World Heritage Committee’s 31st session in Christchurch that the target of working with communities was added to the World Heritage system’s Strategic Objectives, thus giving us the so-called ‘5 Cs’: Credibility, Conservation, Capacity-building, Communication and Communities. This picked up the issue of community involvement in listing, management and monitoring processes, even though not tied only to Indigenous communities. The World Heritage Centre, in the meantime, turned its attention to working with the Secretariat of the UN Convention for Biological Diversity and the IUCN to produce guidelines about best practice examples for the management and conservation of World Heritage places that are on lands or waters occupied or used by Indigenous and traditional local communities, or are or include sacred sites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469605313476783">Oviedo and Puschkarsky (2012)</xref> outline the IUCN’s progress in adopting a rights-based approach to the management of natural heritage, while the results of IUCN’s Indigenous Communities and Conserved Areas initiative can be seen on its website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469605313476783">IUCN, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The action also shifted to the UNHCHR and Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva and the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) in New York. At the Commission, Pakistani sociologist and human rights activist, Farida Shaheed, had been appointed Independent Expert to investigate cultural rights. In 2011 she chose to focus on rights issues related to cultural heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469605313476783">UNHRC, 2011</xref>). At the Consultative Meeting and in a subsequent address to the Human Rights Council, I suggested that it was now important to show how cultural rights principles relating to cultural heritage might translate into conservation practice. By coincidence this question was taken up by Norway ICOMOS in a workshop that looked at developing a rights-based approach to World Heritage management. This key meeting has already had a significant impact on the ICOMOS Triennial Plan, 2012–14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605313476783">Ekern et al., 2012</xref>: 223–224).</p>
<p>The UNPFII had been established in 2002 as one outcome of the International Decade of the World’s Indigenous Peoples (1995–2004). Taking the World Heritage system as part of its remit, it embarked on a strategy to achieve what the supporters of WHIPCOE were unable to do. Of particular note is the preparation by participants at the Forum’s 10th session in May 2011 of a <italic>Joint Statement on Continuous Violations of the Principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent in the Context of UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469605313476783">UNPFII, 2011a</xref>). The statement aims inter alia ‘to establish an Indigenous advisory body which should be involved in the evaluation of all nominated properties that are situated in the territories of Indigenous peoples and in monitoring the conservation and management of such World Heritage properties’. We are now waiting to see if this initiative will be more fruitful than the earlier attempt to establish WHIPCOE.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1469605313476783"><title>Dispelling the ‘bad boy’ image</title>
<p>The central question in this study is how Australia was able to run concurrently two seemingly contradictory campaigns within the World Heritage system, one against In-Danger listing without State Party consent and the other in favour of WHIPCOE. The answer lies largely in the Australian governance context, where political and professional decisions were made by the various actors – political parties and individual politicians, bureaucratic agencies and individual public servants – whose view of the world and heritage conservation within it varied considerably. From my conversations with senior Environment Australia personnel, there was genuine pride in the way Australia was managing its heritage, including World Heritage, and a certainty that they were meeting best international standards, and offence was therefore taken at suggestions of mismanagement coming from ICOMOS, UNESCO and others. But it was also apparent that there were strong differences of opinion within the heritage bureaucracy, as indeed there were also within parliamentary ranks, about what constituted best practice, especially in relation to engagement with Indigenous Australians. In general, however, it seemed to have been a case of the politicians and the heritage professionals, both in the bureaucracy and practice, parting ways; the politicians caught up in the national sovereignty issue and the professionals mostly more concerned to support Indigenous rights to conserve their heritage.</p>
<p>Similar divisions existed, too, within Australia ICOMOS, as seen in the late 1990s when the first draft of a revised Burra Charter was released for members’ comments. It had attempted to shift the organization towards a more holistic and inclusive approach, only to be roundly criticized by some members who argued that the organization should stick to its established focus on historic buildings. The draft was revised again before being approved in late 1999. Other, more progressive members were disappointed but held sway when it came to representing Australia ICOMOS in the Kakadu debate. They also won approval at its Annual General Meeting, which I chaired as Australia ICOMOS President in November 2001, for an <italic>Australia ICOMOS Statement on Indigenous Cultural Heritage</italic> that recognizes inter alia that the Indigenous cultural heritage significance of places can only be determined by the Indigenous peoples themselves; that they must be effectively involved in decisions affecting their heritage, and in managing places significant to them; and that they need to have control over information about their heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469605313476783">Australia ICOMOS, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>It was, therefore, this alliance of progressive politicians, bureaucrats and practitioners that supported the WHIPCOE initiative and that, after it failed, continued to work for change in other ways. At the government and bureaucratic levels, considerable efforts were made to rebuild Australia’s reputation within the World Heritage system. This was facilitated by its membership in the Committee in the years 2007–11 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605313476783">Australian Government, 2011</xref>, for a list of contributions it claims to have made). Of particular note is the initiation and subsequent provision of financial and technical support for a process of reflection on the future of the World Heritage Convention, which was deemed necessary in view of its approaching 40th anniversary and the 1000th inscription on the World Heritage List. The Australian proposal was adopted by the Committee at its 32nd session in Quebec City in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2012</xref>) and a working group to draft a strategic plan to guide implementation of the Convention over the next decade was set up at the 2009 session in Seville, with Australia as the chair.</p>
<p>The working group’s <italic>World Heritage Committee’s Vision and Strategic Action Plan, 2012–2022</italic> was adopted by the General Assembly of States Parties in 2011 and the first progress report on implementation of the plan was endorsed by the Committee at its 36th session in St Petersburg in 2012. While this was largely a bureaucratic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605313476783">Logan, 2012b</xref>: 125), the clear philosophical emphasis can be seen on reconfirming the primacy of OUV within the Convention and its purpose to protect and conserve, with the assistance of the international community, the OUV of those places that are deemed to possess it. The plan allows for consideration of environmental, societal and economic needs but, while sustainability features in the 2012 progress report on the plan’s implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605313476783">UNESCO, 2012</xref>), other societal needs such as human rights are not mentioned.</p>
<p>Again, the view that Australia is achieving best international practice in the heritage field is voiced in the government’s end-of-term report on its three-year period on the World Heritage Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605313476783">Australian Government, 2011</xref>: 3). One of the achievements was in engaging with Indigenous peoples. Certainly the Kakadu controversy had forced Australian national and state governments and their agencies to work much more carefully and sensitively with Aboriginal people in matters concerning their cultural heritage. Indeed, showing concern for WHIPCOE can be interpreted as partly a face-saving device for the Australian Government, designed to counter criticism directed towards it over Kakadu. Be that as it may, the results in Kakadu have generally been to the benefit of the local Indigenous people and the property itself. In 2006, for example, the government announced the rehabilitation of Coronation Hill, a disbanded uranium mining site that had operated during the 1950s and 1960s in Kakadu National Park. Several years later and after the fall of the Howard government, the new ALP-controlled government was persuaded to support incorporation of the Koongarra excision in the Kakadu property and this was achieved at the World Heritage Committee’s 35th session in Paris in 2011. The Mirrar are now asking the Australian Government to support incorporation of the Jabiluka site as well (<italic>Sydney Morning Herald</italic>, 7 April 2011).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1469605313476783"><title>Cape York Peninsula</title>
<p>The extent to which Australian governments and their environment and heritage bureaucracies have sought to increase engagement with Indigenous peoples is seen in the process currently being used to determine whether Cape York should be nominated for World Heritage listing. Cape York is a vast peninsula in northernmost Queensland, almost 15 million hectares in area and with a population of around 19,000 people of whom over half are Indigenous. The peninsula was identified by the IUCN as a potential World Heritage site as long ago as 1982 but a concerted move towards nomination only began with the release of Peter Valentine’s report – <italic>Compiling a Case for World Heritage on Cape York Peninsula</italic> – in 2006. Although the Australian and Queensland governments have so far supported the idea of Cape York (or at least parts of it) being nominated, probably as a Cultural Landscape, no boundaries have yet been defined. Indeed, neither Cape York as a whole nor parts within it have been registered on the Australian National Heritage List or added to Australia’s Tentative List, both actions being prerequisites for Australian nominations.</p>
<p>The Queensland State Government, through its Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM), is leading the move on behalf of the Australian Government. In 2007 Queensland’s Government, then held by the ALP, enacted the <italic>Cape York Peninsula Heritage Act</italic>, establishing a process for declaring ‘Areas of International Conservation Significance’. The criteria used for identifying such areas are the same as those used for World Heritage areas. What is important is that, in response to demands from the Cape York Traditional Owners, an assurance was given to them by the current Australian Minister for the Environment, Tony Burke, as well as by the then Minister for the Environment in Queensland’s ALP government, Vicky Darling, that the nomination will only go forward with their free, prior and informed consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469605313476783">Queensland Government, 2011</xref>: 3, 2012).</p>
<p>This use of the human rights discourse by the traditional owners and the government and non-government agencies working with and for Indigenous peoples has emerged strongly over the last decade. It was clearly reinforced by Article 10 of the UNPFII <italic>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605313476783">2007</xref>). The continuing discussions at Forum meetings in New York have sought to elaborate on the key notion of free, prior and informed consent and to require its enforcement in various processes, including World Heritage inscription. At the Forum’s 10th session in 2011 it was concluded that free, prior and informed consent is a right to be enjoyed by all Indigenous peoples. Such consent should be:<disp-quote>
<p>… given freely, without coercion, intimidation or manipulation (free); sought sufficiently at all stages, including from inception to final authorization and implementation of activities (prior); based on an understanding of the full range of issues and implications entailed by the activity, or decision in question (informed); and given by the legitimate representatives of the indigenous peoples concerned. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605313476783">UNPFII, 2011b</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In Cape York, numerous consultative meetings have been held, feedback forms have been uploaded onto DERM websites, and booklets, brochures and a DVD have been produced as a way of reaching out to the community, explaining World Heritage concepts (for example, Cultural Landscape) and attempting to allay fears about what inscription would mean to Cape York people. Potential social and economic opportunities of inscription are highlighted and comparison is drawn with other Australia World Heritage properties. The estimate that Australia’s World Heritage properties contribute around AUD12 billion to the national economy and support 120,000 jobs is advertised, accompanied by the message that inscribing appropriate parts of Cape York could generate local revenue and employment in land and sea management activities, tourism development, promotional activities and community-based projects and businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469605313476783">Queensland Government, 2011</xref>: 18).</p>
<p>Private sector development interests are already engaged in the area and are important stakeholders in the negotiations about World Heritage nomination. Rio Tinto, the majority shareholder in ERA (the mining company involved at Kakadu), is exploiting bauxite at Weipa on Cape York’s west coast. The views of the local Indigenous people are mixed. Some draw support from non-Indigenous environmental groups such as the Wilderness Society for a strategy of tying consideration of the nomination to continuation of government protection of the region’s wild rivers and Aboriginal fishing rights under the Queensland’s Wild Rivers Act, 2005. Others support greater economic development and related job creation and are backed in this by the lawyer, Noel Pearson, who hails from Cape York and is a highly influential Indigenous spokesman on the political right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469605313476783">Elks and Barrett, 2011</xref>). Such division aside, the Indigenous inhabitants of Cape York will benefit generally from a set of ‘Planning for Country’ capacity-building activities that have been provided as part of the consultation program. Even if the nomination comes to nothing, therefore, the process of planning for country and the associated capacity-building activities will have been valuable, leaving Cape York’s Indigenous communities better prepared to safeguard their heritage.</p>
<p>While the key difficulty is no doubt the clash of intentions for the peninsula between those seeking to expand the exploitation of resources for economic purposes and those seeking to protect heritage values, many other problems confront the nomination process. The size and complexity of the proposed site – a vast bio-cultural region containing diverse landforms and 37 Aboriginal language groups – stretches the notion of cultural landscape. Also, what does ‘community participation’ and the right to free, prior and informed consent mean in the context of so many communities? Who makes the decision? Wherein lies the authority? Normally, as outlined above, the senior traditional owners decide for their clans, but some parts of Cape York have more than one claimant owner while, according to Anita Smith, Australian delegate to the World Heritage Committee 2007–11 and subsequently advisor to the Cape York nomination project, other tracts may have no claimants at all (personal communication, 5 May 2012).</p>
<p>Moreover, the process of engaging in a meaningful way with Australia’s Indigenous people is slow. The process has to move according to informal ‘Australian Indigenous time’, not bureaucratic Paris time. Unfortunately this slowness has meant that the Cape York process has become caught up in the shifts of national and state politics. The recent Queensland state election (24 March 2012) saw a massive swing away from the sitting ALP government and the installation of a conservative Liberal-National Party coalition government led by Campbell Newman. Uniquely in Australia, Queensland has a unicameral parliament, so there is little that can be done to temper the actions of a government with an overwhelming majority. When members of the new government were sitting in opposition, they were strongly pro-development, supporting mining expansion and opposing the protection of the wild rivers and other supposed impediments to economic progress. The Newman government quickly announced that it will repeal the Wild Rivers Act, but it remains unclear whether the government will maintain the direction set by its predecessor for developing the Cape York nomination – or indeed whether it will continue the process at all. According to the Wilderness Society (2012), six new mines have been proposed to exploit coal, bauxite, kaolin and mineral-sand deposits. It claims the Queensland Government is rushing to approve mining plans for the area in ‘a race between mining interests and the World Heritage listing… trying to make sure as many of these mines are approved to reduce the size and scale of the World Heritage Area’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605313476783">Caruana, 2012</xref>).</p>

<p>In their important recent volume <italic>Heritage Regimes and the State</italic> (2012: 11), Regina Bendix et al. ask how UNESCO’s global efforts interact with pre-existing local, regional and state efforts to conserve or safeguard culture. This article has shown that World Heritage conservation, being concerned with the use of scarce resources, will always be part of a political process that plays out at and across international, national and local levels. In Australia, conservation efforts at Kakadu and Cape York have come into conflict with powerful development interests. Since the Kakadu crisis, Australia has been moving along a path towards a rights-based approach to World Heritage. On a wider, international front it was even one of the proponents of WHIPCOE. While respect for the rights of Indigenous peoples has been central to the way in which the Australian and Queensland ALP governments were considering World Heritage nomination for Cape York, the governance context has changed and recent political interventions now threaten to set Australia back on a confrontationist path, not only with its Indigenous people but also with UNESCO and the World Heritage system.</p>
<p>Currently, the World Heritage consultative program in Cape York has ground to a halt and politicians and professionals seem to be going in different directions again. Unless the new Queensland Government abides by the commitment to obtaining free, prior and informed consent from Cape York’s Indigenous people, it may not be possible to proceed to nomination and inscription at this time. To make the nomination without such consent would certainly be out of step with current moves by States Parties such as Norway, as well as IUCN, ICOMOS, UNPFII and UNHRC, to establish a rights-based approach to World Heritage management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605313476783">Ekern et al., 2012</xref>). It would undo the good will that Australia has been rebuilding in recent years within the World Heritage system. National and local politics seem to be prevailing over heritage protection. Both in Australia and more generally the importance of internal governance and political tensions needs to be clearly recognized. Only through such recognition will a better understanding of the behaviour of States Parties in relation to World Heritage conservation be gained and a more realistic appraisal of the operations of the World Heritage system achieved. A focus on the internal workings of the States Parties suggests a corollary: that the way to win improvements in the World Heritage system will be as much through debates and lobbying within the States Parties as through discussions on the floor of World Heritage Committee meetings or in UNESCO corridors.</p>
