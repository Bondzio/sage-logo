<abstract>
<p>This study explored self-reports of five childhood maltreatment (CM) subtypes and their associations with current suicide risk in a sample of 500 homeless persons. Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Individual, unique, and cumulative associations of CM subtypes and subtype combinations with suicide risk (no vs. low vs. moderate/high) were examined. In multivariate analyses, four of the five CM subtypes were associated with suicide risk in individual models, but not in a model that included all CM subtypes. The strongest associations were found for reports of multitype CM involving all five subtypes. Mental disorders and female sex were independently associated with suicide risk. Clinicians working with CM victims should be aware that homeless clients are likely to report multitype maltreatment and should assess a variety of CM experiences. Future studies need to further examine multitype maltreatment and suicidal behaviors in homeless populations with complex conditions.</p>

<p>The high rates of suicide found in homeless populations are a serious health concern. In a study following 8,933 male shelter users, accidents, poisoning, and suicide were the leading causes of death among individuals aged 18–44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077559512439350">Hwang, 2000</xref>). The mortality ratio estimates for death by suicide among homeless and marginally housed men and women were 2.3 to 6.0 compared to those of the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077559512439350">Hwang, Wilkins, Tjepkema, O’Campo, &amp; Dunn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077559512439350">Nordentoft &amp; Wandall-Holm, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, high rates of suicide ideations and attempts were reported in homeless populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077559512439350">Kales et al., 1995</xref>), especially in clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077559512439350">Prigerson, Desai, Liu-Mares, &amp; Rosenheck, 2003</xref>). For example, among 7,224 homeless men and women with current mental illness, 66.2% reported lifetime suicidal ideations, 51.3% reported a lifetime suicide attempt, and 8% reported a suicide attempt in the previous month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077559512439350">Desai, Liu-Mares, Dausey, &amp; Rosenheck, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Suicidal ideations, plans, and attempts are complex behaviors and are associated with a variety of psychological, biological, sociocultural, and environmental risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077559512439350">Nock et al., 2008</xref>). The growing literature on child abuse and neglect suggests that an examination of the association of childhood maltreatment (CM) and current psychological functioning may increase our understanding of mental health and suicidal behavior in homeless individuals. Existing studies indicate high rates of CM and other adverse childhood events in homeless populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077559512439350">Blankertz, Cnaan, &amp; Freedman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077559512439350">Ryan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077559512439350">Stein, Leslie, &amp; Nyamathi, 2002</xref>). Reports of CM are consistently associated with a variety of negative outcomes in adulthood including suicide ideations and attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077559512439350">Saunders, 2003</xref>). Studies have demonstrated that childhood sexual abuse (CSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077559512439350">Bebbington et al., 2009</xref>), physical abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077559512439350">McHolm, MacMillan, &amp; Jamieson, 2003</xref>), and emotional abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077559512439350">Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Monson, Meyer, Caster, &amp; Sanders, 1998</xref>) were associated with suicidal behaviors. The majority of studies focused on only one or two particular CM subtypes, typically sexual and/or physical abuse, and did not assess or control for other forms of maltreatment. However, sexual and physical abuse often co-occur with neglect and emotional maltreatment, especially in clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077559512439350">Finkelhor, Ormrod, &amp; Turner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077559512439350">Higgins &amp; McCabe, 2001</xref>), and only a minority of maltreatment victims report experiences of a single form of maltreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077559512439350">Saunders, 2003</xref>). The few studies assessing multiple CM subtypes found that reports of CSA, childhood physical abuse (CPA), childhood physical neglect (CPN), childhood emotional abuse (CEA), and childhood emotional neglect (CEN) were all associated with suicidal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077559512439350">Roy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077559512439350">Roy &amp; Janal, 2006</xref>). However, each subtype was typically examined individually without controlling for other subtypes. Unraveling the overlap between different forms of maltreatment is essential for understanding CM but is still underresearched.</p>
<p>To determine the unique contribution of individual CM subtypes to a person’s psychological functioning, studies need to consider a variety of maltreatment experiences as well as confounding variables that may be associated with the study outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077559512439350">Higgins &amp; McCabe, 2001</xref>). Such studies were informed by two competing models. The <italic>common effects model</italic> is based on the assumption that any serious form of child abuse or neglect has a harmful, nonspecific impact on an individual’s development. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077559512439350">Kendall-Tackett (2002)</xref>, exposure to abuse and neglect results in behavioral (e.g., substance abuse), cognitive (e.g., low self-efficacy), emotional (e.g., depressive mood), and social (e.g., selection of violent partners) dysfunctional patterns that increase the risk for mental health problems and disorders. Similarly, in his <italic>self-trauma model</italic>, Briere proposes that CM exposure leads to dysfunctional attachment, psychological distress, negative representations of the self and others, and conditioned emotional responses to maltreatment-related stimuli. It also results in the development of maladaptive affect regulation skills which increases the risk for externalizing behaviors such as substance abuse and self-injury in response to stressors and negative emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077559512439350">Briere, 2002</xref>). Consistent with the common effects model, studies have found that different CM subtypes had a similar pattern of association with psychological problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077559512439350">Mullen et al., 1996</xref>). At the same time, it has been suggested that reporting multitype maltreatment—that is experiencing more than one CM subtype—is associated with more severe outcome than reporting a single form of maltreatment and is more important than the type of maltreatment per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077559512439350">Higgins &amp; McCabe, 2001</xref>). This assumption was supported by studies demonstrating cumulative effects of CM subtypes on suicidality. For example, a recent study examined the associations of reporting CSA, CPA, and witnessing domestic violence with reports of suicidal ideations and attempts. After controlling for other risk factors, men and women who reported CSA or CPA were up to 3 times more likely to report suicidal behaviors, with smaller odds for witnessing domestic violence. The largest risk was found for individuals who reported all three experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077559512439350">Afifi et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, increasing numbers of childhood adversities were consistently associated with increasing suicide risk in a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077559512439350">Bruffaerts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077559512439350">Dube et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077559512439350">Enns et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the common effects model, some researchers assume that certain CM subtypes are particularly detrimental and more strongly related to adverse health outcome than others. In their <italic>four traumagenic dynamics model</italic>, Finkelhor and Browne suggest that exposure to CSA involves four traumatizing dynamics: traumatic sexualization, betrayal, disempowerment, and stigmatization. These dynamics result in misconceptions and negative connotations toward sex and sexual relationships, and feelings of guilt, shame, helplessness, and isolation. The authors propose that traumatic sexualization and specific aspects of stigmatization, and, thus, the co-occurrence of all four dynamics are unique for CSA and are the cause of the more severe and specific effects of CSA compared to other CM subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077559512439350">Finkelhor &amp; Browne, 1985</xref>). Indeed, some studies demonstrated that CSA was uniquely associated with suicidal behaviors even when controlling for other CM subtypes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077559512439350">Brown, Cohen, Johnson, and Smailes (1999)</xref> found that the risk for suicide attempts was 5.7 times and the risk for repeated suicide attempts was 8.4 times greater for young adults who reported CSA than for those who did not report any CM, while CPA and neglect were not significantly associated with suicidal behaviors. Among female college students who completed measures of CSA, CPA, and physical punishment, women who reported CSA had significantly higher suicidal ideation scores than all other groups. Physically abused participants had higher scores than nonmaltreated but similar scores as physically punished participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077559512439350">Bryant &amp; Range, 1995</xref>). It has also been suggested that the two most violent CM subtypes—CSA and CPA—have more detrimental effects than less violent forms. According to Joiner’s <italic>interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077559512439350">Van Orden et al., 2010</xref>), serious suicidal behavior is the result of three preconditions: the ability to perform self-harming behavior and complete suicide; feeling like a burden to others; and lacking a sense of belonging. According to the theory, exposure to more severe and physically painful CM subtypes is a greater risk factor than exposure to less painful subtypes because they promote habituation to physical pain; and thus, increase the ability to perform self-harming behavior and complete suicide, and they are also more likely to result in feelings of burden and disconnection. The model predicts that CPA and violent CSA have the strongest association with suicidal behaviors. In fact, Joiner found that reports of CPA and violent CSA had similar associations with lifetime suicide attempts but were more strongly related to suicide attempts than less severe CM subtypes in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077559512439350">Joiner et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the classification of individuals who report multitype maltreatment still presents a considerable methodological challenge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077559512439350">Lau et al. (2005)</xref> examined three different CM classification systems to determine their usefulness for predicting developmental outcomes: The <italic>severity/frequency system</italic> was based on the severity and frequency of each reported CM subtype (without prioritizing one particular CM subtype over another). The <italic>hierarchical</italic> <italic>system</italic> prioritized active over passive subtypes and assigned each participants to one of four mutually exclusive groups in the following order: CSA, CPA, neglect, and emotional maltreatment. The <italic>expanded hierarchical system</italic> assumed the aforementioned CM hierarchy but also accounted for multitype maltreatment by including certain CM subtype combinations. Lau et al. found the strongest support for the expanded hierarchical system in understanding study outcomes. Thus, we used an expanded hierarchical classification system for the current study. Only few studies have examined the unique associations of individual CM subtypes with suicidal behaviors using expanded hierarchical classification systems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077559512439350">Arata, Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Bowers, and O’Farrill-Swails (2005)</xref> categorized college students into six groups: (1) no maltreatment, (2) neglect only (no abuse), (3) CEA (no neglect), (4) CPA (no CSA), (5) CSA (no CPA), and (6) both CSA plus CPA. Individuals who reported CSA, CPA, and both CSA plus CPA were more likely than individuals from all other categories to have ever attempted suicide but did not differ from each other. Individuals reporting multitype maltreatment engaged in more suicidal and life-threatening behaviors, had lower self-esteem, and were more depressed and promiscuous than individuals who reported no or a single CM subtype, regardless of the subtype.</p>
<p>In summary, although our knowledge of the association of CM and current suicidal behaviors has increased, significant gaps continue to exist, with lack of knowledge most apparent with regard to individuals who report multitype maltreatment. It is still unclear whether particular CM subtypes are uniquely associated with suicidality in the context of multitype maltreatment. Furthermore, it is unclear how different CM subtypes act together, that is how particular subtype combinations are associated with suicidality, and whether their effects are simply cumulative or differential depending on the subtypes and their specific combinations. The current study addresses the existing gaps in the literature by assessing five different CM subtypes, classifying participants into single-type and different multitype maltreatment groups, and investigating the associations of individual CM subtypes and subtype combinations after controlling for other forms of CM. We used a sample of homeless adults to examine these questions because such a study can provide important information related to high-risk populations with complex and concurrent conditions (i.e., high rates of suicidal behaviors, multitype maltreatment, and other suicide risk factors). To understand the association of CM and suicidal behaviors, it is not only important to include a variety of CM subtypes, but also other risk factors that may be associated with suicidality. For example, studies with homeless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077559512439350">Eynan et al., 2002</xref>) and housed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077559512439350">Afifi et al., 2008</xref>) individuals showed that mental disorders are associated with suicidality, and homeless populations tend to have high rates of mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077559512439350">Fazel, Khosla, Doll, &amp; Geddes, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077559512439350">Canetto &amp; Sakinofsky, 1998</xref>) including homeless women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077559512439350">Benda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077559512439350">Eynan et al., 2002</xref>) were more likely to report suicidal ideations and attempts than men.</p>
<p>Thus, the current study assessed a variety of self-reported CM subtypes (i.e., CSA, CPA, CEA, CPN, and CEN) and suicide risk factors in a sample of homeless men and women. We had four main objectives: to determine (1) whether each individual CM subtype is associated with current suicide risk; (2) whether particular CM subtypes are uniquely associated with suicide risk after controlling for other CM subtypes; (3) whether reporting more CM subtypes is associated with greater suicide risk; and (4) whether reporting more violent CM subtypes and particular subtype combinations is associated with greater suicide risk than reporting less violent CM subtypes. We hypothesized that (1) each CM subtype is individually associated with suicide risk after controlling for other suicide risk factors (individual models); (2) CSA and CPA are uniquely associated with suicide risk after controlling for other CM subtypes (simultaneous model); (3) increasing numbers of CM subtypes are associated with increasing suicide risk (cumulative model); (4) reporting CSA alone, reporting CPA alone, the combination of CSA plus CPA, and the combination of all five CM subtypes are associated with greater suicide risk than reporting only neglect/emotional maltreatment (combination model); and (5) psychiatric disorders and female sex are associated with suicide risk (covariate analysis). We used the entire sample to examine Hypotheses 1–3. We used only the subsample of individuals who reported any CM to examine Hypothesis 4. Psychiatric disorders and sociodemographic variables were included as covariates in every model.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Inclusion criteria, recruitment, and procedures have been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077559512439350">Torchalla et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, we recruited 500 homeless adults from multiple sites in three cities in British Columbia, Canada: Vancouver, Victoria, and Prince George. Participants were at least 19 years old, willing and able to give informed consent, able to communicate in English, and self-identify as being homeless during the month prior to study entry. Purposive sampling was used to recruit a significant proportion of women, young adults, Aboriginals, and individuals living on the street. Of the 500 study participants, 489 (97.8%) provided complete suicide risk information and were included in the current study. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 66 years (mean: 37.95; standard deviation [<italic>SD</italic>] = 11.01); 39.5% were women and 0.6% self-identified as transgendered. Fifty-six percent self-identified as Caucasian, 40.0% as Aboriginal, 2.0% as African Canadian, 0.8% as Hispanics, 0.6% as Asian, and 0.6% as “other” ethnicity; 50% was living on the streets and 50% was staying in shelters. Sixty-three percent had not graduated from high school; 27.9% had a high school diploma, 7.0% had a university degree, 0.2% had completed professional studies, and 1.9% indicated they had “other” education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077559512439350">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>To recruit individuals living on the streets, interviewers walked along the streets and to places where homeless people were known to be present. Existing outreach and drop-in center teams were contacted to request help in recruiting. To recruit individuals living in shelters, interviewers visited all available shelters in Victoria and Prince George, and selected shelters in Vancouver. Eligible individuals were informed about the study goals and procedures, their participation and rights as participants. Individuals who gave written informed consent attended a one-session, structured clinical interview. Diagnostic interviews were administered by research assistants who had received training for this specific assessment; most of them had previous experience in surveying this population. Participants were asked about their literacy. Individuals who were able to read were given the opportunity to complete the CM questionnaire themselves. Every participant was offered help in reading the consent form and completing the questionnaires. Participants received $30 reimbursement for their time. Ethical approval was obtained from the Behavioural Research Ethics Board of the University of British Columbia and the Providence Health Care Research Institute.</p>

<sec id="section4-1077559512439350">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Demographic information included age, sex, ethnicity (Aboriginal, Caucasian, African Canadian, Asian, Hispanic, and “other”), education (≤ Grade 4; Grades 5–8; some high school; high school diploma; some college/university [but no degree]; college/university graduation; graduate professional studies, “other”), and current housing situation (shelter; street homeless; and “other”).</p>
<p>CM was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire–Short Form (CTQ-SF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077559512439350">Bernstein et al., 2003</xref>). The CTQ-SF is a retrospective self-report inventory that assesses five CM subtypes—CSA, CPA, CPN, CEA, and CEN—that the participants experienced <italic>“when they were growing up”</italic>. Examples of CTQ-SF items are <italic>Someone tried to touch me in a sexual way or tried to make me touch him.</italic> (CSA); <italic>People in my family hit me so hard that it left me with bruises or marks. </italic>(CPA); <italic>I didn’t have enough to eat. </italic>(CPN); <italic>People in my family said hurtful or insulting things to me.</italic> (CEA); and <italic>I felt loved.</italic> (CEN, reverse-scored item). The questionnaire consists of 28 items answered on a 5-point Likert scale, including 5 items for each subscale and 3 items to assess minimization/denial. We adopted the severity classification proposed by the developers to ensure that the reported experiences are at a level serious enough to be labeled “maltreatment”: For each subscale, the severity was categorized as <italic>none</italic>, <italic>low</italic>, “<italic>moderate</italic>, and <italic>severe</italic>. Participants who scored <italic>moderate</italic> or <italic>severe</italic> on a scale were categorized as having experienced the corresponding CM subtype. The cutoff scores were ≥8 for CSA, ≥10 for CPA, ≥10 for CPN, ≥13 for CEA, and ≥15 for CEN. The CTQ-SF showed good psychometric properties in clinical and nonclinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077559512439350">Bernstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077559512439350">Thombs, Lewis, Bernstein, Medrano, &amp; Hatch, 2007</xref>). For the current sample, the internal consistency was good (α = .81). Alpha coefficients for the five subscales were .82 (CSA), .75 (CPA), .78 (CPN), .73 (CEA), and .78 (CEN).</p>
<p>Current suicide risk was measured using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus, version 5.0.0 (MINI-Plus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077559512439350">Sheehan et al., 1998</xref>), a structured clinical interview based on diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th ed. (DSM-IV) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10. It was designed to assess current and lifetime substance use and mental disorders and suicidality. The suicidality scale assesses the current suicide risk using 11 self-report items, of which 1 was related to lifetime suicide attempts (<italic>Did you ever make a suicide attempt in your lifetime?</italic>), and 10 were related to suicidal ideations (<italic>Did you think about suicide?)</italic>, plans (<italic>Did you have a suicide plan?</italic>), attempts <italic>(Did you attempt suicide?</italic>), and self-injury (<italic>Did you want to harm or injure yourself</italic>?) that the participants experienced <italic>in the past month.</italic> The responses are added to result in an overall score between 0 and 52. Suicide risk was calculated according to the developer’s instruction: <italic>no</italic> (0 points), <italic>low</italic> (1–8 points); <italic>moderate</italic> (9–16 points); and <italic>high</italic> (≥17 points) risk. For the analyses, participants reporting moderate or high suicide risk were combined into one category. The MINI-Plus suicidality scale has been used in previous studies to assess suicide risk in clinical populations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077559512439350">Franck, De Raedt, Dereu, &amp; Van den Abbeele, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077559512439350">Gunter et al., 2008</xref>). For the current sample, the internal consistency was good (α = .80).</p>
<p>
<italic>Psychiatric disorders </italic>were also derived from the MINI-Plus. We included information regarding the following diagnoses: current (i.e., past 12 months) drug dependence, current alcohol dependence, lifetime depressive episode, lifetime psychotic disorder, and lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The modules start with a screening question (e.g., for depressive episode, <italic>Have you ever been consistently depressed or down, most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks?</italic>). Positive responses are followed by an exploration of other DSM-IV diagnostic criteria that is based on an algorithm specific for each disorder. The MINI-Plus derived diagnoses achieved good reliability and validity in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077559512439350">Sheehan et al., 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Data were inspected to assess the distributions of the outcome variables. Continuous data for both CTQ scales and suicide risk were nonnormally distributed. Because corrections for skew (using square root and log scale) did not approach a normal distribution, the data were categorized as described above. To test the hypothesis that suicide risk was higher among individuals reporting CM, Cochran-Armitage Trend tests identified trends for each of the five CM subtypes across the three suicide risk levels (<italic>no</italic> versus <italic>low</italic> versus <italic>moderate/high</italic>) in univariate models. To examine whether the relationship between CM reports and suicide risk was cumulative, trends across suicide risk levels were identified for the numbers of CM subtypes reported (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 concurrent CM subtypes). Trends for dichotomized sociodemographic variables and psychiatric disorders were also examined. For multivariate analysis, CM subtypes, psychiatric disorders, and sociodemographic variables were included in proportional odds models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077559512439350">McCullagh, 1980</xref>). We estimated the odds of increasing suicide risk for CM with ordinal logistic regression models (OLRMs). OLRMs calculate the probability for the three suicide risk levels by estimating two equations simultaneously: the odds of (1) having one of the higher risk levels (i.e., <italic>low</italic> or <italic>moderate/high</italic>) compared to having no risk, and (2) having moderate/high risk compared to having one of the lower (i.e., <italic>no</italic> or <italic>low</italic>) risk levels. Thus, an odds ratio (OR) greater than 1.0 can be interpreted as a greater odd of having <italic>increasing</italic> suicide risk levels. OLRMs assume that the coefficients describing the relation between the lowest versus the two higher risk levels are the same as those describing the relationship between the two lower versus the highest level (proportional odds assumption). Therefore, the outcome of an OLRM is only one set of coefficients. The score test was used to test the validity of the proportional odds assumption for all models.</p>
<p>Four different types of multivariate models were constructed. First, we utilized five individual models, one for each CTQ subscale, to examine their unadjusted and adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for increasing suicide risk (individual models). Second, we calculated a model that included all five CTQ subscales concurrently to examine unique association of each CM subtype with suicide risk (simultaneous model). In the third model, the CTQ scales were entered as a class variable representing 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 concurrent CM subtypes, with individuals reporting zero CM experiences as the reference group (cumulative model). The fourth model (combination model) included only participants who reported any CM. Individuals who reported only neglect and/or emotional maltreatment (i.e., CPN and/or CEA and/or CEN, but no CSA and no CPA; subsequently referred to as CPA/CEA/CEN) were used as the reference group to examine the ORs and 95% CIs of increasing suicide risk for different subgroups of participants reporting CM. We created the following subgroups: (1) only CSA (no other CM subtype), (2) only CPA, (3) both CSA + CPA, (4) CSA + CPN/CEA/CEN (no CPA), (5) CPA + CPN/CEA/CEN (no CSA), (6) CSA + CPA + CPN/CEA/CEN (but not all five CM subtypes), and (7) CSA + CPA + CPN + CEA + CEN. All reported <italic>p</italic> values were two-sided and significance was set at <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05. The analyses were conducted using SAS 9.1.</p>

<title>Descriptive Information</title>
<p>Three different aspects of CM reports were examined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077559512439350">Table 1</xref>). First, the percentage of participants reporting the different CM subtypes was calculated. Each individual CM subtype was reported by more than half of all participants. Second, we computed the number of CM subtypes reported. Almost three quarter of all participants reported exposure to more than one CM subtype. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077559512439350">Table 1</xref> also presents the percentages of participants who reported CSA and CPA single-type maltreatment and different CM subtype combinations. The majority of the sample was at some risk for suicide at the time of the assessment. Prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders ranged from 17.4% (psychotic disorder) to 70.1% (drug dependence). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077559512439350">Table 2</xref> presents the co-occurrence of reported maltreatments by subtype. Across all subtypes, single occurrence was rare and for most subtypes co-occurrence of two or more types of maltreatment was typical.</p>

<p>Differences in suicide risk as a function of CM subtypes and other suicide risk factors are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077559512439350">Table 3</xref>. For maltreatment, all subtypes but CPN were related to increased suicide risk. There was a pattern of increasing numbers of CM subtypes across suicide risk levels, such that the rates for no suicide risk tended to decrease while the rates for low and moderate/high risk tended to increase with increasing number of CM subtypes reported (this pattern was tested in multivariate analyses presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077559512439350">Table 4</xref>). Depressive episode, psychotic disorder, and PTSD but not alcohol or drug dependence were related to greater suicide risk.

<title>Psychiatric disorders and sociodemographic factors</title>
<p>Fifth, we hypothesized that psychiatric disorders and female sex are associated with suicide risk. Depressive episode, psychotic disorder, and sex remained significantly associated with suicide risk in every model. Individuals with a lifetime depressive episode or psychotic disorder were about 2 times more likely and women were about 1.5 times more likely to have increasing suicide risk. Although PTSD was associated with suicide risk in univariate analysis, the association was not significant in multivariate models. Age, ethnicity, education, drug and alcohol dependence were not associated with suicide risk in any model. Overall, Hypothesis 5 was supported by these data.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As hypothesized, reports of CSA, CPA, CEA, or CEN were associated with suicide risk in individual models, even after controlling for sociodemographic and psychiatric risk factors. Unexpectedly, CPN reports were not associated with suicide risk. It has been suggested that hopelessness and a negative cognitive style contributes to suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077559512439350">Abramson et al., 2000</xref>), while family connectedness and emotional well-being are protective factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077559512439350">Borowsky, Ireland, &amp; Resnick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077559512439350">Borowsky, Resnick, Ireland, &amp; Blum, 1999</xref>). Unlike individuals who experience CSA, CPA, or emotional maltreatment, individuals who are physically neglected by their parents may still receive emotional support and affection and may develop emotional stability and greater suicidality resilience. Our study adds to the existing literature by examining whether particular CM subtypes are uniquely associated with suicide risk after controlling for other CM subtypes. The hypothesis that CSA and CPA are uniquely associated with suicide risk was not supported by the data; possibly because all CM subtypes were so strongly intercorrelated that any significant association was lost after eliminating the shared variance. This result is somewhat different from findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077559512439350">Ystgaard, Hestetun, Loeb, &amp; Mehlum (2004)</xref> where physical and sexual abuse remained associated with repeated suicide attempts when controlling for neglect and other childhood adversities in individuals hospitalized after a suicide attempt. However, findings similar to ours have also been reported. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077559512439350">Rodgers and colleagues (2004)</xref> indicated that CSA and CPA lost most of their significant associations with specific health behaviors when all five CTQ subscales were simultaneously entered into the statistical model. Such results indicate that researchers should account for multiple CM subtypes in their study design rather than examining individual subtypes in isolation, especially in homeless populations where the overlap is so substantial. Moreover, the unique association of specific experiences with particular study outcomes may have been overestimated when only one or two CM subtypes were assessed.</p>
<p>Our study advances current knowledge by distinguishing single-type from multitype maltreatment and providing an in-depth investigating of the co-occurrence of multiple CM subtypes in the analyses. Furthermore, our hypotheses were derived from two competing theoretical models of CM; one assumed that all CM subtypes are similarly harmful while the other one assumed that certain CM subtypes are particularly detrimental and more strongly related to adverse health outcomes than others. An important finding in this context was that reporting all five CM subtypes made consistent, independent contributions to current suicide risk. First, increasing numbers of CM subtypes were associated with suicide risk after controlling for other risk factors. However, the cumulative effect was nonlinear and exposure to two CM subtypes was not significantly associated with suicide risk. The pattern of these results may indicate that the experience of being exposed to any CM versus experiencing no CM is crucial for an individual; but once this threshold is exceeded, the number of CM subtypes experienced does not have the same relevance unless all areas of life are affected (as reflected in reports of all five CM subtypes). Second, among all CM subtype combinations examined, only the combination of all five CM subtypes was associated with greater suicide risk than reporting only neglect/emotional maltreatment in both adjusted and unadjusted analyses. In contrast, reporting only CPA and reporting CSA plus CPA was not associated with higher suicide risk than neglect/emotional maltreatment, although they are often regarded as being more severe than other forms of maltreatment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077559512439350">Van Orden et al., 2010</xref>). Our results suggest that, at least for homeless individuals, the extent of CM experiences may be more important for suicidality than a particular subtype per se, which is consistent with the common effects model of child maltreatment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077559512439350">Briere, 2002</xref>). Studies focusing on one or two CM subtypes may underestimate the extent of maltreatment their participants actually experienced and may fail to identify those subgroups that are at a particularly high risk.</p>
<p>It must be kept in mind however, that reporting only CSA was associated with higher suicide risk than neglect/emotional maltreatment in the unadjusted model. The significance of the association of pure CSA and suicide risk was lost after adjusting for covariates, which indicates that psychiatric disorders or sociodemographic factors may account for this relationship. A similar effect has been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077559512439350">Fergusson, Woodward, and Horwood (2000)</xref> in New Zealand adolescents, where the significant association of CSA and other childhood adversities with suicidal behavior disappeared after psychiatric disorders and stressful life events were included in the model. In our study, the odds of increasing suicide risk for pure CSA were still 1.9 times those of neglect/emotional maltreatment in the adjusted model, and it is possible that a lack of statistical power is the reason for the nonsignificance of this result because the number of individuals with pure or two CM subtypes was low. Thus, the association of suicide risk with particular CM subtypes or subtype combination in the context of multitype maltreatment needs to be further explored.</p>
<p>Sex was independently associated with suicide risk, a finding that is in line with other studies among the homeless where women were more likely to report suicidal ideations and attempts than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077559512439350">Benda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077559512439350">Eynan et al., 2002</xref>). As in other studies with homeless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077559512439350">Eynan et al., 2002</xref>) and housed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077559512439350">Afifi et al., 2008</xref>) individuals, mental disorders were also independently associated with suicidality. Our study design does not allow drawing conclusions about the nature of this relationship; it may be that children prone to depression and psychosis are at risk for both CM and later suicidality or that other factors which were not considered in this study accounted for the observed associations.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. We relied on self-reports which were not confirmed by external sources, and information on CM, mental health symptoms, and substance use may be under- or overreported. Retrospective CM self-reports may be affected by recall biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077559512439350">Epstein &amp; Bottoms, 2002</xref>) and may under- or overestimate the actual occurrence in the sample. On the other hand, CM experiences may be more salient for individuals who are currently suicidal; thus, they may be more likely to report such experiences than individuals with no suicide risk, and the associations of maltreatment with suicide risk may be overestimated. We did not assess the severity, frequency, duration, and perpetrator of CM and missed certain adversities which were not included in the CTQ (e.g., witnessing family violence). We used categories to analyze CM subtypes and suicide risk. Although the categorization is in line with the instructions of the CTQ and MINI developers, it introduces an artificial grouping conceptualization to two phenomena that are essentially continuous. Our study did not include individuals who committed suicide and who may differ from individuals reporting suicidal ideations, plans, and unsuccessful attempts. The cross-sectional design and the absence of a housed comparison group also limit the conclusions that can be drawn from our study. One of the greatest challenges in this study was related to unraveling the overlap of the different CM subtypes. This is particularly complicated for homeless and other clinical samples with complex and concurrent mental health conditions and high rates of CM. For example, in a study of college students assessed with the CTQ, 50% reported no abuse, 20% reported exposure to one CM subtype, 13% reported two, 5% reported three, 6% reported four, and 5% reported exposure to all five CM subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077559512439350">Arata, Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Bowers, &amp; O’Farrill-Swails, 2005</xref>). The overlap in our study was substantially larger with 21% of the sample reporting all five CM subtypes and reports of pure subtypes almost nonexistent. These findings indicate the need of including more clinical populations in CM studies because conclusions derived from research among the general population may not be applicable to them. Furthermore, we need to optimize ways of CM categorization for multitype maltreatment populations to understand differential, cumulative, and interactive effects of CM.</p>
<p>Clinicians who work with homeless men and women should be prepared to do a suicide risk assessment and crisis intervention, if indicated. They should also be aware that suicidal individuals may have mental disorders and CM experiences. Clinicians should be prepared to refer homeless individuals who report CM experiences or symptoms of mental illness for additional treatment. Clinicians who work with CM victims should be aware that homeless clients are likely to report multitype maltreatment, and they should be prepared to assess a variety of CM experiences beyond sexual and/or physical abuse. Our study provides some direction for identifying which CM subtypes and combinations are associated with current suicidal behaviors in homeless individuals. While exposure to even a single subtype of maltreatment was an indication for increasing suicide risk, the subgroup with the highest risk reported a pattern of extensive maltreatment exposure. Such individuals may have generalized their maladaptive coping strategies to multiple interpersonal and living contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077559512439350">Finkelhor et al., 2007</xref>) and may need intensive, trauma-informed interventions that account for the effects of multitype maltreatment and concurrent conditions. However, although no particular CM subtype was identified as being more detrimental than others, their unique effects are not sufficiently explored. In view of the complex and concurrent health and living conditions of homeless individuals, researchers from multiple disciplines need to share and integrate their domain-specific expertise in order to fully understand how CM affects future behavior.</p>
