<abstract>
<p>A new punitive approach in the French prison sector has emerged as a result of the European Court of Human Rights and the French administrative courts exerting pressure on prison governors in response to the complaints made by prisoners’ families, the demands of human rights groups and the requirements of human rights protection bodies. By publicizing cases of suicide and using strategic litigation based on the right to life, human rights groups and barristers have put the prison administration under pressure. The resultant risk management policy and death-avoidance approach are not linked to the decline of the welfare state, as claimed by new penology scholars, but rather to a shared risk management thinking between the prison administration and human rights groups.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While various legal scholars, sociologists and criminologists appreciate that there are connections between human rights, risk and knowledge, much of their work continues in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1362480612467361">Murphy and Whitty, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1362480612467361">Whitty, 2011</xref>). Lawyers, for instance, have not stressed the role of risk management in human rights studies, while criminologists and sociologists have paid little attention to human rights and court cases involving prisoners at the national and European levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1362480612467361">Chantraine and Kaminski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1362480612467361">Murphy and Whitty, 2007</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1362480612467361">Feeley and Simon’s (2003)</xref> ‘new penology’ did point to the role of civil litigation in spreading the model of risk to criminal justice, they did not take human rights into account, reflecting the limited influence until recently, of human rights norms and courts on US civil or criminal law. Indeed, large-scale law suits over medical and mental health care filed during the last 20 years have culminated in 2011 in the <italic>Brown v. Plata</italic> case demonstrating the importance of litigation. As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1362480612467361">Simon (2011</xref>: 251) himself: ‘<italic>Brown v. Plata</italic> represents a potential turning point, toward a future where American political leaders and penal planners are forced to justify the comprehensive effect of imprisonment on prisoners and public safety.’</p>
<p>Before the <italic>Brown v. Plata</italic> case, the approach of the ‘new penology’ was arguing that the main emphasis of the prison administration was on efficient population management and cost–benefit analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1362480612467361">Feeley and Simon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1362480612467361">Simon, 2005</xref>) and no longer on the rehabilitation of individual prisoners, a characteristic of the former ‘correctional’ penology. This shift between old and new penology appears to be a result of the decline of the welfare state and a mark of the new management of poverty where the poor are no longer disciplined and transformed but managed by risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362480612467361">Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1362480612467361">Feeley and Simon, 1992</xref>). Influenced by the actuarial approach, penal administrators aim to identify and reduce the risks of violence and recidivism among inmates by selectively incapacitating certain offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1362480612467361">Heydebrand and Seron, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1362480612467361">Pratt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1362480612467361">Walker, 1993</xref>). Individuals considered at high risk of recidivism are not to return to society, leaving offenders with a lower risk of recidivism to benefit from parole and conditional release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362480612467361">Auerhahn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1362480612467361">Rose, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1362480612467361">Simon, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1362480612467361">2000</xref>). Under this approach, sentence-reduction policies, assignment and security programmes are the preferred fields for the use of actuarial calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362480612467361">Cliquennois, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362480612467361">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362480612467361">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1362480612467361">Liebling and Arnold, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, to date, scholars of the actuarial approach have ignored suicide, even though it has been a prominent and recurrent subject of statistics since at least the 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1362480612467361">Hacking, 1990</xref>: 66). This omission is remarkable, since the protection of life and health has been a key issue for statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1362480612467361">Quetelet, 1869</xref>), a leading claim of civil societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1362480612467361">Foucault, 2008</xref>), and one of the guiding principles of the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 2) and of the European Prison Rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1362480612467361">Van Zyl Smit and Snacken, 2009</xref>). For people confronted by ‘total institutions’ like prisons, where inmates are highly vulnerable, the right to life is crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1362480612467361">Goffman, 1961</xref>). This is particularly the case in French prisons, where the rates of prisoner murders and suicides<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1362480612467361">1</xref></sup> are the highest in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1362480612467361">Turner, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This article argues that various organizations motivated by a range of politics including human rights litigation have come together to create an actuarial response to suicide prevention that is punitive. In order to investigate this shared approach to risk management between organizations, we will examine the rationale of the French suicide and murder prevention policy and its impact on prisoners and prison staff based on: (1) a study of the prison administration’s circulars and internal memorandums; (2) an analysis of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and the French administrative courts and tribunals; (3) briefs filed by barristers and lawyers on behalf of human rights groups; (4) indirect interviews with members of prisoners’ rights organizations; (5) interviews with barristers who have represented prisoners in litigation against the prison administration; (6) interviews with staff in the statistical department of the prison administration; (7) interviews with staff in the prison administration’s suicide prevention team; (8) interviews with members of the prison administration’s legal team; (9) extracts from the archives of associations that campaign against suicide and murder in prisons; (10) coverage in the French media between 1982 and 2008; and (11) extracts from the reports of French human rights protection bodies.</p>
<p>As we shall explain in detail, the emergence of a rationale that combines a risk management approach with a death-prevention policy shapes the interactions between the prisons, the European Court of Human Rights and the French administrative courts and tribunals. All these courts exert pressure on prison governors, fuelled by complaints from prisoners’ families, the demands of prisoner-welfare groups and the requirements of the French human rights protection bodies. By publicizing prisoner suicides and murders, these bodies have forced the prison administration to change its regulations to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. These pressures have resulted in a model of prison administration where actuarial risk management thinking has been sharpened and intensified. In contrast to the US literature on ‘new penology’, this amplification of risk has not been linked to the decline of the welfare state and to the new management of poverty since the French Bismarckian model of welfare (introduced in 1945) was reinforced under the Mitterrand Presidency (in the 1980s and 1990s) and has not radically changed—despite some medical care reforms—under the Sarkozy Presidency (in the second half of the 2000s). Indeed, due to the continuity of the Bismarckian model, Sarkozy’s neoliberal approach, in contrast to what happened in the UK under Thatcher’s premiership, has not implied a replacement of the struggle against poverty by a new model of management of the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1362480612467361">Hassenteufel and Palier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1362480612467361">Palier and Thelen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1362480612467361">Ramaux, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The first section of this article examines the recent history of the actuarial risk management of suicides and murders by the French prison administration. It brings us, in the second section, to developments in case law regarding inmates’ rights to life and their effects on the prison administration. In the third section, we examine the campaigns focusing on prisoners’ rights and analyse their implications for the prison system. The risk management thinking and its punitive aspects appear to be the consequences of both human rights groups’ litigation and shared references between the prison administration and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</p>

<title>The development of specific actuarial risk management and death-avoidance policies</title>
<p>The prevention of murders and suicides in French prisons is characterized by a death-avoidance model and an actuarial approach that is close to HM Prison Service’s model in England and Wales. As in England and Wales, the French prison service has adopted a suicide prevention policy that seeks to prevent death and preserve life through an actuarial approach. Gathering statistics and information, both systems attempt to identify risky inmates, places and times, often creating different scales for treating those considered at risk of suicide or self-harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1362480612467361">Liebling, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1362480612467361">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1362480612467361">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1362480612467361">Liebling and Arnold, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A risk management approach to suicide prevention accepts some level of suicide. Reflecting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1362480612467361">Foucault’s (2008)</xref> observation that the risk model tolerates the phenomenon that has to be regulated, the goal of the French suicide prevention policy is not to prevent all suicides but merely to reduce their number, first by 20 per cent over the five years between 2004 and 2008 (Memorandum, 5 March 2004) and then by 50 per cent from 2009 onwards (Memorandum, 15 June 2009). By shrinking the number of suicides, the policy of the prison administration also aims to reduce the amount of litigation about suicides brought by relatives against the prison administration (Circular, 26 April 2002; Memorandum, 24 September 2008; Memorandum, 7 July 2009).</p>
<p>Statistical analyses of suicides (regarding times and places) have been produced in France since the late 1960s (Circular, 15 February 1967), with a definition of the prisoners most at risk going back to the beginning of the 1980s (Memorandum, 2 December 1980; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1362480612467361">Cliquennois, 2010</xref>). However, it was only in 2002 that the risk management approach became actuarial: ‘Tournier [a leading expert and scholar on French prisoner demography] wrote reports on suicides regularly during the 1980s, but they contained only descriptive statistics … there was no regression analysis’ (Senior Manager, Prison Department of Statistics). The prison administration then asked Bourgoin, a demographer in the French National Institute for Demographic Studies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1362480612467361">2</xref></sup> to conduct a study identifying prisoners at risk of suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362480612467361">Bourgoin, 1994</xref>). This piece of research resulted in a set of administrative guidelines based on risk factors that drew on a ‘rational choice’ theory of suicide (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1362480612467361">Table 1</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362480612467361">Bourgoin (1993</xref>: 622) states: ‘A significant proportion of suicides is due to deception resulting from denial to an inmate’s demand or from failed escapes.’ In accordance with neo-classical economic theory, Bourgoin breaks down the number of recorded suicides by place (i.e. areas within prisons) and date, to enable prison staff to identify potentially suicidal prisoners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362480612467361">Bourgoin (1993</xref>: 609–610) explains the higher suicide rates in prison compared to those in society as a product of the oppressive effect of incarceration. Suicide, in short, is caused by the prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362480612467361">Bourgoin, 1993</xref>: 622).</p>

<p>According to this approach and by individual, family and psychosocial factors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1362480612467361">Table 1</xref> and Terra Report, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1362480612467361">2003</xref>), which was reinforced by a 2005 memorandum (Memorandum, 4 July 2005), certain types of prisoners pose an abnormally high risk of suicide, especially during specific ‘high-risk’ periods of their confinement (Circular, 26 April 2002). Since 2007, the prison service has attempted to identify inmates who constitute a suicide risk based on updated guidelines (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1362480612467361">Table 2</xref>) while responding to the level of risk with suitable measures (Memorandum, 14 May 2007). The result has been to reinforce an actuarial risk management approach in which staff and selected inmates in each prison identify those prisoners who represent a suicide risk and others who do not, according to a set of risk factors, guidelines and skills developed in specific training courses. The main risk factors are: (1) certain prisoner profiles (e.g. first-timers, sex offenders, prisoners serving long sentences, prisoners who have confronted their victims face-to-face and prisoners whose parole requests have been rejected); (2) prisoners with certain family and individual profiles (e.g. those who suffered physical or sexual abuse during childhood, those with a family history of suicide, abandonment or self-harm); (3) the economic and psycho-social context (‘copy-cat’ suicides, suicides when in mourning, suicides as a response to being threatened, suicides as a result of loss of employment or homelessness); (4) the ‘peak times’ for suicide (at the beginning or end of a sentence, at the weekend, at night); (5) the ‘peak places’ for suicide (solitary confinement cells, cells for prisoners on remand in local prisons); (6) the means of suicide (96% of prison suicides are by hanging).</p>

<p>More evidence of the actuarial risk management approach can be found in the 2007 guidelines that adjust preventive measures according to the level of risk, the nature of the crisis and the prisoner’s access to the means of committing suicide. Prisoners registered on the ‘suicide watch list’ and designated as ‘high risk’ are transferred for at least 24 hours to special cells with no anchor points and equipped with video-surveillance, fireproof mattresses and tear-proof sheets. The prisoners at high risk are also dressed in special tear-proof clothes and are observed by prison staff around the clock (Memorandum, 15 June 2009; Memorandum, 17 December 2009). Low-risk prisoners are assigned to shared cells in accordance with their specific needs. Prison officers are also trained in how to support prisoners at low risk and receive first-aid instruction so that they can intervene in cases of attempted suicide. Other prisoners who provide such assistance are rewarded by being given access to television, more frequent telephone calls, priority for jobs in prison workshops and educational classes and the opportunity to participate in other activities, as well as increased opportunities to apply for parole (Memorandum, 15 June 2009). Prisoners assessed at medium risk of suicide are placed under enhanced surveillance by prison staff and offered psychiatric counselling (Memorandum, 7 July 2009). Prison officers are also required to complete observation forms about each medium-risk prisoner, to schedule interviews with the prison governor at their request (Memorandum, 7 July 2009), to enrol them in prisoner discussion groups and to provide them with facilities to make emergency telephone calls (Memorandum, 15 June 2009).</p>
<sec id="section3-1362480612467361">
<title>The segmentation of suicide risk management as part of a death-avoidance model</title>
<p>In the risk management approach to suicide prevention in French prisons, the paramount goal is to prevent deaths. In accordance with the ‘rational choice’ theory of suicide proposed by Bourgoin, this goal is sought by limiting opportunities to commit suicide and access to the means of suicide in order to change inmates’ behaviour. To help reduce the risk of suicide, prison staff members who prevent prisoners from dying (i.e. ‘coming to a suicidal inmate’s rescue when the latter is in danger of death’ according to the 9 September 2009 Memorandum) are paid a bonus. Prison staff have since been obliged to identify potential aggressors and self-harmers using risk-factor guidelines (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1362480612467361">Table 3</xref>), which are recorded on forms. They must then implement suitable responses to the risks, most commonly by placing the prisoners in solitary confinement, and by increasing staff surveillance of them (Memorandum, 24 September 2008; Memorandum, 31 July 2009).</p>

<p>This development of the actuarial risk management approach and the death-avoidance model is a consequence of judgments of the courts and tribunals as well as human rights campaigns mounted by prisoners-rights activists, added to the fact that the prison administration has been held liable for the protection of prisoners. The human rights groups – which originated most of this case law – have relied largely on the prison administration’s own regulations and risk factors to make prison authorities responsible for suicides committed in custody. At the same time, the various preventive provisions described above can be seen, in large part, also as consequences of the pressure generated by these human rights groups.</p>

<title>Developments in case law concerning the prison administration’s responsibility to guarantee prisoners’ right to life</title>
<p>Several provisions adopted by the prison administration regarding suicide prevention refer directly to jurisprudence. In them the prison service analyses court judgments in a bid both to reduce the likelihood of recourse to the courts by relatives of dead prisoners and in order to bring the prison regulations into line with the new requirements (Circular, 26 April 2002; Memorandum, 7 July 2009). These case law developments were in large measure due to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on 4 October 1989 (<italic>Alder v. Federal Republic of Germany</italic>) that compelled all the signatory states to the European Convention on Human Rights to take action to avoid suicides in prisons. This precedent was subsequently confirmed and extended by the ECHR, which stipulated that the right to life should not only be passively respected, but that the prison administration had an obligation to take practical, appropriate steps to protect this right when the risk of suicide was known or foreseeable on the basis of Article 2 and Recommendation 98(7) of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (ECHR, <italic>Ketreb v. France</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1362480612467361">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>These new measures included daily medical supervision and intensive surveillance with direct visual contact (ECHR, <italic>Keenan v. United Kingdom</italic>). By requiring prisons to take these kinds of measures, the ECHR placed recognition of the right to life above that of self-sufficiency considerations; prison authorities now have to decide on measures and general precautions that reduce the risk of self-harm without totally ending individual autonomy (ECHR, <italic>Keenan v. United Kingdom</italic>). A compromise between the right to life and the principle of autonomy was struck by the ECHR when it required prisons to have established a previous risk of suicide before rendering them liable. Nevertheless, the ECHR gave priority to the right to life when it stated, in <italic>Tanribilir v. Turkey</italic> and <italic>Renolde v. France</italic>, that the prison authorities had a positive obligation to take practical preventive measures to protect the right to life of individuals. This court decision even requires, if necessary, the use of constraint against the inmate himself.</p>
<p>In France, the jurisprudence of the Conseil d’Etat (CE; Council of State), the highest French administrative court, reflected the decisions taken by the ECHR by reinforcing the obligations of the government in a judgment of 23 May 2003 (CE, <italic>Chabba</italic>). These obligations, further confirmed in 2007 (CE, <italic>M. Delorme</italic>) and 2008 (CE, <italic>Consorts Seigner</italic>), were explicitly based on ‘the over-riding nature of the right to life’ (CE, <italic>Kechichian</italic>; CE, <italic>Section Française de l’Observatoire des Prisons</italic>), as well as on the level of the prisoner’s vulnerability and dependence on the prison administration. Following the so-called ‘Sauvé’ doctrine of the Council of State (developed in 1999), which favours the integration of the rights of the European Convention on Human Rights into the case law of the Conseil d’Etat, the judges of the Conseil d’Etat held that a simple error was sufficient to establish the State’s liability, requiring only that there had existed an error, a fault and a clear causal link between the error and the fault (CE, <italic>Section Française de l’Observatoire des Prisons</italic>, 2008). The fault could be the death of a prisoner and the error could be the absence of appropriate measures taken by the prison administration regarding a suicide risk of which they were already aware.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1362480612467361">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus emerged a perfect fit between the ECHR’s reasoning and the logic of risk factors. For the prison administration to make an error in violence prevention, the fault must have been predictable. In other words the prison administration must have been—or should have been—aware that the inmate might commit suicide or murder another inmate, knowledge that presupposes a prior assessment of the possible risk involved (self-harm or aggression against another prisoner). This risk can be considered as established if the prisoner had already attempted suicide, even more so if the prior attempt had taken place recently (Administrative Court of Appeal (CAA) Douai, 14 May 2008), if the method used by the prisoner to commit suicide was the same as in a previous attempt, if the suicide occurred in similar circumstances (such as being in solitary confinement or being transferred to another prison), or if the prison staff had decided that the inmate was at risk by applying the guidelines. Indeed, the prison may be at fault even if there was no previous issue. A French judge in an administrative court held in 2010 that the State was also liable in prisoner suicides even when there was no concrete evidence of the prisoner’s suicidal impulse, when it ruled that leaving a prisoner alone with a scarf in a cell during the exercise period constituted a lack of vigilance (and thus an error) in the light of a theoretical assessment of risk (Tribunal Administratif (Administrative Court) Caen, 19 January 2010). The prison administration is thus liable whenever there is an absence of reaction (e.g. insufficient surveillance) or an inadequate response (e.g. mistaken assignment of the prisoner, poor organization of a department) to a ‘foreseeable risk’ of suicide that could have been avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1362480612467361">De Graeve, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Court judgments concerning the risk of self-harm or aggression towards other prisoners also reveal the extent to which the right to life has been reduced to the avoidance of death. Various examples can be found detailing the removal of all objects or substances that could be used to commit suicide or murder (including scarves and bed sheets), particularly intense surveillance, the placement of the prisoner at risk in a double cell and the assignment of a dangerous inmate to solitary confinement to protect his fellow prisoners (CE <italic>Kechichian</italic>; CE <italic>Chabba</italic>; CE <italic>Delorme</italic>; CE <italic>Consorts Seigner</italic>; CE <italic>Section Française de l’Observatoire International des Prisons</italic>). In sum, above and beyond the issue of ‘intensive surveillance’ of prisoners, judges have more and more frequently upheld a broader obligation of ‘vigilance’ when it comes to preventing violent acts.</p>
<p>By widening the prison administration’s range of responsibility, employing the terminology of ‘risk’, and by requiring a death avoidance approach, these court rulings, and in particular the ECHR <italic>Osman v. UK</italic> decision which refers explicitly to ‘the suicide risk of which the penitentiary administration should have been aware’, have contributed to the spread of death-prevention policies and a risk management approach to prisoners’ right to life. Such court decisions have further encouraged the prison administration to develop a greater expertise about the risk factors for suicide and violent death.</p>

<title>Campaigns by prisoners’ rights associations</title>
<p>The emergence of the risk management approach, encouraged by case law, also has to be understood in the context of campaigns by prisoners’ rights associations that began in the late 1990s. The 3 March 2000 Memorandum, the 26 April 2002 Circular and the 29 May 2009 Memorandum issued by the prison administration reveal the extent of the influence of these campaigns. The 2000 Memorandum warns in particular that, ‘Relationships with the families of suicide victims must be improved. With increasing frequency, these families have questioned the official version of the circumstances of their relatives’ deaths, with the support of prisoners’ rights associations and the media.’ Subsequent circulars and memoranda likewise insisted on the necessity of improving relationships with victims’ families to reduce their recourse to criminal litigation against the prison administration.</p>
<sec id="section6-1362480612467361">
<title>Risk expertise applied by human rights groups</title>
<p>Campaigns by human rights groups were mainly the work of the French section of the <italic>Observatoire international des Prisons</italic> (OIP; International Observatory of Prisons) founded in 1996; Ban Public founded in 1999; the <italic>Association des Familles en Lutte contre l’Insécurité et les Décès en Détention</italic> (AFLIDD; Association of Families Fighting against Insecurity and Death in Prisons) created in 1997; and <italic>Faites la Lumière en Detention</italic> (FLD; Shed Light on Prisons) founded in 2008. These campaigns consisted for the most part of posting information on websites;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1362480612467361">5</xref></sup> publishing reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1362480612467361">OIP, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480612467361">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1362480612467361">2005</xref>); issuing press releases (recalling the suicide and violent death risk factors); participating in television programmes (FLD); organizing protest days against suicide and violent deaths; staging events such as Ban Public’s ‘The Outdoor Prison Visitors’ Room’ or the FLD’s ‘Inmate Death in Prison Day’ (Lyon, 8 December 2008); and referring cases to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the <italic>Commission Nationale de Déontologie et de Sécurité</italic> (CNDS; French National Commission for Ethics and Safety) and the <italic>Commission Nationale Consultative des Droits de l’Homme</italic> (CNCDH; French National Consultative Committee of Human Rights), whose objectives are to expose administration failures leading to the suicide or murder of prisoners, as well as to request parliamentary investigations (for instance that of 28 October 2002). This investigation led to prison visits and reports on the circumstances of deaths.</p>
<p>The reports issued by these organizations have systematically pinpointed risk factors, asking the administration for more risk-reduction and further research on risk. For instance, the CPT’s 2003 report, published after visits to prisons at Toulouse, Clairvaux and Loos, pointed out that these prisons had failed to implement the measures introduced in the 2002 circular on ‘the procedures to be applied in regard to both the identification of suicide risks and the support provided to those subject to this risk’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1362480612467361">CPT Report, 2004</xref>: 24–25). Likewise, in its report covering the years 2001 to 2006, as well as in its reports in 2007 and 2009, the CNDS cited several suicides that, it claimed, were caused by the lack of knowledge of the prisoners’ case histories and their suicide risk. This under-estimation or unawareness of the suicide risk led to oversights in the follow-up, support and surveillance of the prisoners concerned, who all went on to commit suicide (CNDS Report, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1362480612467361">2006</xref>: 563–565, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1362480612467361">2007</xref>: 373–374, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362480612467361">2009</xref>: 50–51). Invoking the State’s obligation to institute positive measures to protect the right to life, the CNDS recommended that each prisoner’s suicide risk be assessed on arrival at the prison. They also suggested a range of suicide prevention measures including creating bare-walled ‘crisis cells’, removing window bars while replacing window glass with unbreakable glass (to eliminate anchor points for makeshift nooses used by prisoners to hang themselves) and substituting standard bed sheets with non-tearable ones for all prisoners who self-harmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362480612467361">CNDS Report, 2009</xref>: 51). These human rights organizations (CPT, CNCDH, CNDS) have heavily relied on international human rights treaties and forced the prison administration to extend the use of a risk-based approach to prisoners’ right to life while contributing to the validation of the death-avoidance prevention policy.</p>
<p>In the same manner as the human rights official bodies (CPT, CNCDH, CNDS), the human rights groups (OIP, Ban Public, FLD), which are NGOs that stem from grass-root actors (and not from international bodies and treaties’ prescriptions), have denounced the high rates of prison suicide and murder, using academic studies and sources referred to in the prison regulations. These human rights groups have asserted protection of prisoners’ lives as their first goal and have integrated the actuarial approach into their policy (without taking into account the critical criminology literature on ‘new penology’). In fact, the new risk management approach seems partially to be a reply to the pressure exerted by crime victims’ associations and some populist politicians. Indeed the OIP supported a risk management approach, claiming that it protects both prisoners and victims by avoiding recidivism. This cognitive union between different stakeholders (with quite different political persuasions) resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1362480612467361">Marie Gottschalk’s (2006)</xref> explanation of the advent of mass incarceration in the USA.</p>
<p>For instance, the OIP demonstrated its interests in the victims of crime by taking the problem of recidivism into account when asking for public money (instead of other topics more focused on prisoners’ rights). This explicit policy in favour of the fight against recidivism led to improved relations with the Government. In addition, the OIP made clear its opposition to the ‘old penology’ by stating that risk factors, in contrast to ‘dangerousness’ factors, had the advantage of being able to take into account contextual data in the analysis of both prison policy and suicide prevention. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362480612467361">OIP (2012</xref>: 40–55), the ‘old penology’ was not based on scientific facts and was too psychological, and too subjective. When defending this risk management approach, the report cites the expertise of several Canadian scholars (such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1362480612467361">Marion Vacheret [2010]</xref> who have recently joined the OIP.</p>
<p>The OIP also collects research-based information on prison suicides from a variety of sources—academic studies, circulars or the various reports (above all the 2003 Terra Report and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480612467361">2009</xref> Albrand Report)—to demonstrate the prison administration’s failings in the identification of suicide risk and the follow-up of inmates at risk. The OIP used Bourgoin’s study based on risk management in its reports of 2000, 2005 and 2012. By using this socio-demographic approach, the OIP attempted to estimate the total number of prison suicides and to highlight the danger inherent in certain prison procedures, such as placing prisoners in solitary confinement. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1362480612467361">OIP (2000</xref>: 91) report states:<disp-quote>
<p>Bourgoin’s research has accurately established an ‘abnormally high rate of prison suicides’ and has disclosed the risk factors: prisoners who succeeded in killing themselves had attempted suicide nearly 25 times more often than the overall average; suicides are more frequent in the <italic>maisons d’arrêt</italic> [remand centres] than in the <italic>maisons centrales</italic> or <italic>centres de détention</italic> [prisons or other long-term detention facilities]; the suicide rate in solitary confinement cells is at least seven times higher than in the rest of the prison.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The magazine of the OIP <italic>Dedans Dehors</italic> (Inside and Out) highlights three kind of risk factors: the time period of suicide (December being at higher risk), the moments of suicide (nights and week-ends being at higher risk), as well as the identity of prisoners at risk (age, family links ...) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1362480612467361">OIP, 2000</xref>). The 2003, 2005 and 2012 OIP reports also listed the risk factors cited in the prison regulations and Bourgoin’s studies in order to criticize both the inefficacy of the measures advocated and the prison administration’s adoption of policies that ran counter to the conclusions derived from statistical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480612467361">OIP, 2003</xref>: 63–66). In the case of the OIP, the emphasis (by the direction of the organization) on disseminating academic studies to its layman’s readership, which includes prison staff, is particularly evident. By providing current information on court cases and prison regulations, the OIP as well as Ban Public disperse a risk-based interpretation of prisoners’ right to life. Ban Public has denounced prison policies that result in prisoner deaths, basing its arguments for the most part on risk assessments used by academic penologists and the authors of the prison regulations. The Terra Report, the circulars and memoranda of 1998, 2002 and 2009 and research articles by several scholars (e.g. Bourgoin) on the prevention of suicide have been published on Ban Public’s website.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1362480612467361">6</xref></sup> In addition, every Ban Public press release ends with a recapitulation of the principal risk factors for suicide.</p>
<p>Far from serving merely as intermediaries between prisoners’ families, prison governors, judges and lawyers, the associations speak the language of actuarial risk regulations, in a bid to invest them with a coercive power to be used against the prison administration. The 2003 OIP report reflected the approach advocated by the 29 May 1998 Circular and enumerated a number of risk factors. It advised against certain practices (in disciplinary matters for example), advocated methods for taking charge of prisoners (such as identifying prisoners on arrival) and recommended better training of staff, as well as improvements in prison conditions such as more family visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480612467361">OIP, 2003</xref>: 63). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1362480612467361">OIP (2005</xref>: 167) cited, by way of example, the National Human Rights Institution: ‘The difficulties encountered by the reforms [for the prevention of suicide] promulgated from 1996 onwards, have impeded their adoption.’ The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1362480612467361">OIP (2005</xref>: 170) also referred to the prison administration progress reports to prove that the measures taken for identifying suicide risks ‘are in no way systematic and their adoption suffers from both lack of means and absence of follow-up’.</p>
<p>These criticisms by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1362480612467361">OIP (2005</xref>: 165) focused in particular on the lack of effectiveness of the grids: ‘The suicide risk assessment is unfortunately ineffective.’ Patrick Marest, the OIP director, asserted in 2008, that ‘the current guidelines based on different suicide risk factors are not effective if they are not put in practice in prisons. The use of these guidelines by the prison staff constitutes an improvement’ (<italic>L’Humanité</italic>, 10 October <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362480612467361">2008</xref>). In their 2012 report, the OIP also highlighted the discrepancies between the quantitative targets of suicide reduction approved by the prison service (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362480612467361">OIP, 2012</xref>: 235) and the poor performance achieved by the prison administration: ‘the action plans have had a weak impact on suicide rates which have only decreased from 0.1813% in 2000 to 0.1776% in 2010, far from the objective targeted by the prison administration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362480612467361">OIP, 2012</xref>: 229). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362480612467361">OIP (2012</xref>: 236) attributed this inefficiency to the prison administration’s amateurism in the identification of suicide risks: ‘The prison administration’s approach to risk management has limits. There is a need for a more professional approach to detection based on risk factors, that should be performed by the prison medical authorities’.</p>
<p>Further evidence of the OIP’s support for a risk management approach can be gleaned from the manner in which they inform journalists about the risk factors for suicide. This was particularly the case in 1999, 2000, 2003 and 2008, as shown by our review of press articles on suicides in prison in national and regional newspapers. Just to take one of the most relevant examples, the Catholic newspaper ‘<italic>La Croix</italic>’ (19 October 2008) stated that: ‘there are in disciplinary confinement cells seven times more suicides than ordinary cells’. Moreover, OIP advocates for a decrease in punishment (and in particular the punitive effect of solitary confinement) through the use of a risk factors approach: ‘Solitary confinement decisions must be limited in order to reduce the risk of suicide’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1362480612467361">OIP, 2005</xref>: 171). However, the punitive effects (isolation in suicide prevention cells, anxiety due to the reinforcement of surveillance and watching) of suicide risk management were not forecast by the OIP.</p>

<sec id="section7-1362480612467361">
<title>Strategic litigation by human rights groups and barristers: proceedings based on risk</title>
<p>At the request of the families of prison suicide and murder victims, the OIP can instruct lawyers to instigate legal proceedings before the administrative courts claiming compensation from the prison administration. The OIP believed that the prison administration was obliged to respect court judgments. According to this optivision of law and human rights, shared by the OIP, legal challenges can be used to achieve social progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1362480612467361">Scheingold, 2004</xref>). Trials also serve as showcases for the OIP lawyers and barristers: ‘It is interesting to see how the prison administration replies publicly to our litigation. Their main argument consists in challenging the risk of suicide’ (OIP lawyer). The cases to be argued are selected in accordance with these varying objectives. Conversely, the law serves as a means for channelling disputes. In this context, lawyers re-frame individual challenges as political demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1362480612467361">Scheingold, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In their actions for inmates’ right to life, the OIP and Ban Public, which have their own legal teams, have developed a network of lawyers ready to litigate prison suicide cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1362480612467361">Sarat and Scheingold, 2006</xref>), some of whom are members of the board of directors of the organization. These lawyers have built up expert knowledge of right-to-life issues that they employ in arguing these cases: ‘I apply the right to life in all cases of suicide thanks to the “Sauvé” doctrine of the Council of State which was in favour of the right to life in French prisons’ (barrister and OIP board member).</p>
<p>However, the politicization of requests from families is limited because the lawyers are required to take case law into account (e.g. they must show that the prison administration committed an error) as well as the judicial logic on risk management. An analysis of 17 briefs (out of 38 lawsuits brought in the field of suicide on average per year) filed by OIP lawyers and barristers indicates that, to maximize their chances of obtaining a judgment against the prison administration, these lawyers have to be able to prove that the risk was foreseeable and that the administration did not respond to this risk by implementing appropriate procedures that could have prevented the prisoner’s death. As one barrister observed: ‘The consequences of many lawsuits are the reinforcement of death prevention and surveillance’. Some activists criticize the lawyers for basing their arguments solely on death prevention and surveillance approaches, to the exclusion of broader issues. As one member of the OIP legal team put it:<disp-quote>
<p>We are dissatisfied with our lawyers, in particular with N., who was instrumental in the adoption of this detestable judicial logic that results simply in an obligation for the prison administration to institute more intensive surveillance and to place suicidal inmates in bare-walled cells … Just ways of forestalling death … For our part we would favour broader suicide prevention measures, such as the reduction of prison sentences and the abolition of solitary confinement.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interpreting prison suicides and murders in terms of risks is seen by human rights groups as an attempt to legitimize their political combat, to ensure that their voices are heard in public debate and to test the observance of the rule of law within prisons. This way of framing their action implies that they support their arguments with statistics and authorized material (e.g. scientific research and official reports) that make their claims difficult to refute. However, by so doing, these activists have in turn contributed to, and participated in, the objectification and legitimization of the control measures that were introduced as the only possible means by which to achieve their ends. The comprehensive use of suicide statistics in the prison regulations, the reports and the media, has led to the objectification of the actuarial version of reality, as well as the inertia and resistance of the prison administration to pressure from elsewhere.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The death prevention policy currently popular in French prisons endorses a rationale based on a death-avoidance model and actuarial risk management. This rationale implicitly tolerates some deaths in custody while forging a new punitive approach to imprisonment: to be alive is a condition of the expression of the power of the State to punish ‘living bodies’. Punishment puts living bodies and souls in a confined space; it is ended by death. This nature of the sentence (affliction of the body) and its condition (the living body) raises questions about the death of people while under the State’s protection, and thus under the rule of law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1362480612467361">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The death-avoidance model has its roots in the actuarial risk management approach, which was not, in France, a result of the decline of the welfare state, as asserted by Feeley and Simon about the USA, but rather the result of European and national case law, media coverage and litigation undertaken by associations based on the right to life. More precisely, in France, the actuarial approach stems from the isomorphism (i.e. a constraining process that forces one unit in a population to resemble other units that face the same set of environmental conditions) between several stakeholders of the prison environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362480612467361">Cavender, 2010</xref>: 516; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612467361">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>). In particular, this article shows that the prison administration and human rights groups and charities share the same cognitive references about the risk factors, the death-avoidance model and the ‘rational choice’ theory of suicide.</p>
<p>This cognitive isomorphism, which is particularly evident in the prison administration and the OIP, can partly be explained by the political and populist pressure exerted on the OIP, by the circulation of knowledge between these organizations, as well as by mimetic and professional isomorphism originating in individuals who move from working for the prison administration to working for the human rights groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612467361">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1362480612467361">Meyer and Scott, 1983</xref>). The OIP, the prison administration, the human rights bodies and the Council of State are all national bodies acting at a macro-level in a way that reinforces their potential resemblance. This high resemblance leads to an increased punishment, which is largely unintended. Seeing that the success of risk management thinking at a global age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480612467361">Bosworth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1362480612467361">Hood et al., 2001</xref>) we can expect a reinforcement of punishment over time.</p>

<p>With a suicide rate of 19.6 suicides per 10,000 inmates per year during the period 2001–2007, France’s level of prison suicides is the highest of the 42 member countries of the Council of Europe (see Council of Europe SPACE 1 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/prisons/space_i_en.asp">http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/prisons/space_i_en.asp</ext-link>). This comparison does not include small countries such as Moldava, Cyprus, etc. (since the suicide rate in these countries is not statistically significant). For the same period, the suicide rate in equivalent countries was 10.8 for England and Wales and 10.1 for Germany. The suicide rates in French prisons cannot be compared with those in hospitals and police cells, because these institutions do not produce statistics, despite recently being put under the supervision of the same external body as prisons.</p>

<p>INED studies populations using the tools of demography in association with those of other disciplines such as geography, sociology, anthropology, economics, biology and epidemiology. It conducts research on universal phenomena such as births, unions, migrations and mortality, and its researchers work in a wide variety of fields, ranging from contraception and abortion to migration trends, suicide, marginal populations, life expectancy and so on.</p>

<p>The recommendation states that: ‘The risk of suicide should be constantly assessed both by medical and custodial staff. Physical methods designed to avoid self-harm, close and constant observation, dialogue and reassurance, as appropriate, should be used in moments of crisis’ (Recommendation R (98)7, III.D.58).</p>

<p>A parallel can be made here with the 2012 extension of corporate manslaughter to custodial institutions in the UK. Nevertheless, the French approach to liability for negligence mainly stems from the case law while the liability for corporate manslaughter in the UK comes from parliamentary lobbying action undertaken by NGOs.</p>

<p>A similar argument is developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1362480612467361">Garland (2011</xref>: 772) when he states, referring to the US case <italic>Brown v.
