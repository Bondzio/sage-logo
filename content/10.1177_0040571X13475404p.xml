<sec id="sec1-0040571X13475404p"><title>Jennifer M. McBride, <bold><italic>The Church for the World: A Theology of Public Witness</italic></bold>, Oxford University Press: New York, 2011; 320 pp.: 9780199755684, £47.50/$74.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>The central concern of this fine study is the question of the proper manner of the Church’s public engagement with matters of contemporary social and political import. The author advances a normative vision of Christian public witness which aims to be ‘simultaneously nontriumphal and faithful to a Christian proclamation of the lordship of Christ’ (p. 9). Key to this is the suggestion that confession and repentance provide the basic shape of Christian public engagement. Public witness in this mode involves the open identification of concrete social sin and brokenness, for which the Christian community assumes responsibility. This it does on the basis of its acknowledged solidarity with the yet unredeemed world and its salutary mission to exist by grace for the sake of that same world. The decisive theological horizon of McBride’s proposal is a firm confidence in the relevance and import of the gospel of Christ’s reconciliation for human life in all spheres. The other factor animating McBride’s argument is cognizance of the reality of the United States as a radically pluralistic society within which Christian public engagement oscillates between the diffuse and muted interventions of the mainline and the overly strident and acrimonious pronouncements of evangelical combatants in the on-going ‘culture wars’ in that land. McBride discerns something less than faithful – and less than fruitful – in both these postures.</p>
<p>Notions like ‘witness’, ‘confession’ and ‘repentance’ can be understood in many different ways. And so McBride devotes the book’s second section to expounding their precise meaning by way of an extended discussion of aspects of the theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Three leading motifs in his work are examined and creatively extended in turn: first, his account of Christ’s formative public presence with its emphasis upon ‘God’s humanity’ and its salutary embrace of human brokenness; second, his emphasis upon the reality-determining character of the reconciliation worked out by God in Christ, such that ‘the grain of the universe is now patterned after the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus (p. 87); and third, Bonhoeffer’s concomitant understanding of the Church as a body of people conformed to Christ in and by their responsible confession and repentance. The exposition McBride provides in these chapters is incisive. Although her interest is always constructive – looking to move ‘with and beyond’ Bonhoeffer in conceiving the contours of a contemporary public theology in America – there is also much to learn simply about the thought of the German theologian itself from these pages.</p>
<p>The final section of the work sets out two ‘case-studies’ of experiments in Christian community and mission in contemporary America – the Southeast White House in Washington, D.C., and the Eleuthero Community in Maine. Writing here in an ethnographic mode, McBride introduces and analyses the animating spirits, forms and aims of these two quite distinctive endeavours. The portraits are concise and sympathetic. Both communities are represented as viable and inspiring examples of public witness marked by the kind of open-handed Christian distinctiveness, humility and humanity recommended in the earlier chapters of the book.</p>
<p>Important lively debates in public and political theology, ecclesiology and missiology stand to be advanced and deepened from McBride’s intervention, not least as a result of her adept combination of theological substance and contextual perceptiveness. And while it is from within the distinctive American religio-cultural situation that McBride has developed her proposal, British and European readers will have little difficulty in transposing her central insights into their own ecclesial and social circumstances.</p>
