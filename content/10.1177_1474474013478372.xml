<p>This book offers an extremely dense voyage in time and space. The author guides the reader along an imaginary expedition where islands across the globe are the foreground of a multidimensional journey. Fischer follows a geographically non-linear track, leaping from one region of the globe to another, while providing astounding insights for each landing area, whether in the Mediterranean cradle, the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean scouring grounds, or in the Arctic glacial roundabout. He builds up his case for the rich complexity of islands by progressively moving through geological, biological, social, economical, political and cultural issues, throughout varying time scales. The result is a veritable synthesis of a huge amount of information on islands across the world, enriched by an in-depth discussion on what all of this purports as retrospective teaching.</p>
<p>As the author argues, islands were islands before humans appeared, but eventually evolved as a result of human colonization. Crete, Fiji, Gotland, Hispaniola, Rapanui (Easter Island), Zanzibar and thousands of other islands had been stitches in the unraveling history of humanity. Cultures and civilizations developed by frequently leveraging on these confined pieces of land surrounded by water. Kings, soldiers, traders, pirates, missionaries, slaves, refugees and, certainly tourists, have been human actors and forces that have shaped island identities since the Paleolithic through the economic and cultural revolutions that occurred in our human saga. Nonetheless, as Fischer stresses, location and not size has been a much more significant determinant for island development: the greater the isolation (or distance from trade routes), the smaller the story. For instance, Greenland, the largest island in the world, has the history of a small island resort; and Northern Canada’s Ellesmere, the ninth largest island in the world, has hardly a history at all. These giant islands strongly contrast with small islands such as the vibrant Singapore, Hong Kong and Manhattan, the geographical positions of which has allowed them to become contemporary global trade hubs, similarly to Crete in around 2000 BC.</p>
<p>The book is generally well written, with a style amenable to both academic and layperson, although it unfortunately lacks the necessary sparkle to keep the reader captivated. The continuous leaps from one region to another and the tendency to load pages with all kinds of anecdotal information may sometimes be tedious and apparently purposeless. The resulting somewhat erratic structure makes specific information difficult to retrieve after passing through it, unless frequent annotations are marked on page margins (which may be a curse for some). This being said, reading any chapter of the book can be the start of a fascinating quest, each time leading to new discoveries about human history and heritage which flows through islands. This is definitely a reading recommended to all those who wish having an ‘executive summary’ on islands across our planet which, in Fischer’s words, is the last isle.</p>
