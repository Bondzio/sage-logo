<p>This issue of <italic>JHSB</italic> includes two articles that compare the health status of same-sex and different-sex couples in the United States. These papers were submitted to <italic>JHSB</italic> at about the same time last year and were reviewed favorably by external reviewers and <italic>JHSB</italic> deputy editors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022146513475587">1</xref></sup> Given the importance and timeliness of the topic and the quality of the work, both articles are presented in this issue of <italic>JHSB</italic>, along with commentary from leaders in the fields of medical sociology, family, and demography.</p>
<p>These two new articles on union status and self-rated health reach the same general conclusion: cohabiting same-sex couples and cohabiting different-sex couples report similar levels of self-rated health but lower levels of self-rated health than married different-sex couples. Even though the two studies were developed independently, there are interesting similarities across the studies, including use of the same data set (National Health Interview Survey) and dependent variable (self-rated health), consideration of socioeconomic status (SES), and differences by gender. But these basic generalities belie important differences between the two articles that significantly advance our understanding of marriage, cohabitation, and health across union types. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022146513475587">Liu, Reczek, and Brown (2013)</xref> go beyond a comparison of marriage and cohabitation to also include unmarried statuses of divorced, widowed, and never-married persons. Liu et al. further consider racial-ethnic variation in these patterns, revealing important differences in union status–health linkages for blacks, whites, and Hispanics that differ for men and women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022146513475587">Denney, Gorman, and Barrera (2013)</xref> take the important step of considering how parental status shapes the link between union status and self-rated health and how this influence differs for men and women.</p>
<p>Both studies address the role of SES in explaining union status–health linkages. Each study finds that persons of low SES have lower self-rated health, but they reach different conclusions regarding the role of SES in producing health disparities across relationship type. Liu and colleagues report that SES does not explain differences in health status between cohabiting same-sex couples and married different-sex couples. Denney and colleagues, however, find that SES “adjusts away” the health gap between the two groups.</p>
<p>These different conclusions are very important from a conceptual as well as a policy standpoint. If SES does fully account for these differences in health, then our analyses might stop there. Yet, if SES does not account for these differences, then our analytic lens shifts to look at other factors, such as discrimination. Unfortunately, the two articles do not resolve this issue. Rather, they raise broader questions about how we should conceptualize and operationalize SES. Liu et al. incorporate measures of education, poverty, and insurance status, while Denney et al. rely on measures of education, unemployment, and income. Further complicating the comparison, the two studies treat education differently. Liu et al. operationalize education as a categorical variable, whereas Denney et al. operationalize it as a continuous one.</p>
<p>Thus, we are left wondering if differences across studies are due to dissimilar ways of considering and operationalizing SES. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022146513475587">Ross and Mirowsky (2013)</xref>, in their subsequent commentary, provide thoughtful ideas for more fully addressing the role of SES in future research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022146513475587">Cherlin (2013)</xref> raises the possibility that we may be overcontrolling in our effort to take SES into account, thus minimizing group differences that reflect the lived experience of marital and cohabiting relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022146513475587">Gates (2013)</xref> points to the potential role of SES in shaping which gay and lesbian cohabiting couples marry (at least in locales where same-sex marriage is legal), a selection process that may differ in degree or dynamics for different- and same-sex couples. We call upon investigators and reviewers to address the conceptual meaning of SES in their future analyses.</p>
<p>These two studies on union status and health differ in other important details as well. The Liu et al. study uses a sample of 330,280 from years 1997 through 2009, while the Denney et al. study relies on a sample of 460,459 from years 1997 through 2008. Interestingly, although the Denney et al. study has the larger overall sample, it actually has a smaller sample of same-sex cohabiting couples (<italic>n</italic> = 3,219) than the Liu et al. study (<italic>n</italic> = 3,293). Other differences include exclusion of Asian and other small ethnic groups from the Liu et al. study, choice of covariates (e.g., geographic region), and types of interactions considered (e.g., Children × Relationship vs. Race × Relationship). These and other details, including different methodological approaches, may play a role in generating different conclusions in the two studies.</p>
<p>In sum, these studies start with the same question and use the same data set but emerge with a different set of considerations to drive future research in this area. These studies represent important advances in our scientific understanding of intimate relationships and health across gay, lesbian, and heterosexual unions.</p>
<p>Taken together, these articles and commentaries point to the immense need for new high-quality, longitudinal, population-level data collections that are specifically designed to address the myriad conditions that explain how and why intimate relationships influence health, potentially for all Americans, even if in different ways across social groups. We hope that these contributions launch new and innovative data collections and studies to guide health policy and, ultimately, improve population health.</p>
