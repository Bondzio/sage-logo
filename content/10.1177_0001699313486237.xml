<p>In this concise volume, Shove, Pantzar and Watson present the results of their long engagement with practice theory. The rationale of practice theory – of this version and others – is to overcome the duality between agency and structure. Instead of taking individual actions as the elementary unit of social life, or starting from structural factors that then shape action, they are considered to be recursively related and mediated through social practices. Thus, we are moving in deep sociological territory. However, rather than theory building <italic>per se</italic>, the authors are interested in practice theory’s potential to act as a vehicle of social change. They think this theme has been underdeveloped in the literature: Saying ‘practices’ makes one think of static routines and habits, but how do they emerge, evolve and disappear? What would policy interventions based on practice theory look like?</p>
<p>Practice theory is a heterogeneous field, with many revered ancestors and current contributors. Shove et al.’s take of it emphasizes the materiality of practices. Their version is based on a clearly outlined small toolbox. Social practices consist of three elementary units: <italic>material</italic> refers to objects, infrastructures, tools, hardware and the body itself; <italic>competence</italic> to know-how, background knowledge, understanding, evaluating and skills; and <italic>meaning</italic> to social and symbolic significance. These elements are integrated in the continuous enactment of the practice. The emergence, persistence and disappearance of practices hinge on the making and breaking of the links between their defining elements.</p>
<p>Starting from these basic units the authors continue towards more complex issues. First, they describe how elements travel and persist. Elements have their own historical trajectories and modes of circulation, i.e. they can exist irrespective of the practices they become or have been part of. For example, cast-iron stoves remained a rarity until 1850s. Only when modes of distribution for heavy items were better developed could they become more common and in turn redefine the meaning of home comfort. Now they have been surpassed by new technologies, but specimens still remain in old buildings and museums. In this sense elements are also more persistent than practices, which are necessarily local and constantly modified in their enactment.</p>
<p>Practice theory entails a shift of perspective: no longer do we follow around the actors, but the (elements of) practices. Becoming a practitioner turns into a question of recruitment into the practice. In the second step, the authors discuss how one becomes carrier of a practice, or is excluded from it. Important conduits in recruitment are existing social networks and communities of practices. Often practitioners are members in overlapping networks or communities, which enables recruitment in novel practices. Both practices and practitioners have careers: the former are constantly evolving through their enactments, the latter go through stages of learning and increasing mastery and identification with the practice. The trajectories of practices and their carriers have in turn effects on the future adoption and enactment of (other) practices. For example, adopting the career path of automobile driving is likely to influence engagements with other modes of transport.</p>
<p>The third step concerns the ways single practices merge into larger units. Shove et al. differentiate between loose and tight linkages: <italic>bundles</italic> are practices that co-exist, but in a loose way; <italic>complexes</italic> are practices that have amalgamated into tight associations and are thus dependent on each other. An example of the former is lifestyle, which is typically defined as consisting of a number of interlocking activities and corresponding beliefs. The latter is illustrated by driving, which historically joined several existing practices into a novel one that today is seen as singular. Linkages are likely to emerge when previously separate practices become spatially or temporally close or when novel elements connect such practices (e.g. Walkman, which links listening to music and running).</p>
<p>The merging of practices into larger units raises the issue of coordination. The next step outlines what the authors call <italic>circuits of reproduction</italic>: how both the elements of a single practice and multiple practices are connected through feedback mechanisms that enable their smooth operation, survival and development, and coordination. These circuits ensure both the continuity and consistency of a singular practice over time and the sequencing and synchronization of practice bundles and complexes. Monitoring performance of a practice over time involves models and standards, like score sheets and scaling instruments but also descriptions of and material equipment for good performance. For example, in snowboarding descriptions of singular moves, different types of board ideal for various uses, and magazines and videos that distribute models of proper practice are important in reproducing snowboarding over time. Aggregating and cross-referencing multiple practices feature larger-scale entities that connect, sustain and modify groups of practices. A topical example of such epistemic objects is obesity, which links and problematizes eating, exercising and shopping practices in a novel way. Consequently, not everything in the world can be unpacked into practices and their elements.</p>
<p>The discussion promotes a picture of society as a continuously evolving system of elements linking into practices, practices breaking up, merging and forming larger units. This process is sustained by individual enactments of the various practices and conditioned by the established structure of practice configurations, resulting in the ‘temporal-spatial fabric of society’. Throughout the volume an eclectic cavalcade of examples, only some of which have been touched on here, illustrates the discussion.</p>
<p>The last chapter focuses on the policy relevance of the theory. Not surprisingly, it is organized around the concepts presented. Viable strategies to change the world are to shape the elements of practices; the relationships between the practices; the career paths of practices and their practitioners; and the coordination of the various practices. To highlight their position, the authors contrast it with what Shove has dubbed the ABC model of policy-making. This currently dominant view focuses on changing individual behaviour through working upon attitudes (enhancing awareness) and choices (removing barriers). Practice-based policy distances itself from this individualistic emphasis to concentrate on social conventions that structure individual action. This is a self-consciously modest take on policy: the practice configuration targeted is always local, which means local results; policy does not influence practices from outside in a sovereign manner, but is involved in the configuration as one complex or bundle among others; practices evolve continuously, which is why policy interventions have to deal with contingent processes and uncertain outcomes.</p>
<p>The book is pedagogical, even overtly so. The basic propositions are constantly repeated, and each chapter begins by restating the journey so far and ends with recapitulating the main points of the chapter. On the other hand, the many empirical examples offered have a certain <italic>ad hoc</italic> character. The fascination – and sometimes frustration – with the text comes from this tension between the conceptual framework and the examples illustrating it, which challenges readers to try the concepts and to seek other examples. The volume is clearly intended as an introduction to a set of analytical tools. It does not go very deep into their relationship to other, related, theoretical concepts. And it does not offer a thorough treatment of a singular case that would seriously test the concepts. This is something subsequent work has to fill in and develop.</p>
