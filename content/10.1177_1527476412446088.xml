<abstract>
<p>By drawing on eighty-nine qualitative interviews in which people account for their use of information and communication technology, this article analyzes how people negotiate their choices and principles in relation to prevalent discourses about proper and questionable conduct and content and whether old discourses are changing in the new media environment. Particular attention is paid to the way in which the cultural category of hobby is used as a speech repertoire that ennobles internet use. By describing their complementary use of different media and the meanings of different artifacts, informants are able to reverse default cultural hierarchies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent research suggests that people are becoming more selective and interactive in the new media environment, engaging with an ever wider choice of media and content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412446088">Cover 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412446088">Deuze 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476412446088">Jenkins 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1527476412446088">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1527476412446088">Livingstone 2004</xref>). Related to this, online communities play an active role developing content and providing viewer feedback (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476412446088">Andrejevic 2008</xref>). Consumers pursue specific content through different media, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1527476412446088">Sonia Livingstone (2004</xref>, 81) notes, we should not conclude that form is unimportant.</p>
<p>These changes pose a challenge for researching new media environments. The active audience has been long acknowledged in qualitative research, and, in that sense, recent changes have even enhanced its timeliness. On the other hand, it becomes increasingly problematic to refer to users of information and communication technology (ICT) as an “audience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412446088">Alasuutari 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476412446088">Ang 1991</xref>). Media audience researchers have increasingly integrated ICT user research and leisure research, as well as vice versa to study how people integrate ICT into their everyday lives, modifying both the technology and their own identity construction (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476412446088">Anderson 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412446088">Bakardjieva 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527476412446088">Haddon 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1527476412446088">Lie and Sørensen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527476412446088">Morley 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1527476412446088">Peteri 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1527476412446088">Silverstone et al. 1991</xref>). This article elucidates the ways in which people negotiate these choices and principles in relation to prevalent discourses about proper and questionable conduct and content. It explores whether old discourses are changing in the new media environment, for instance, whether television is still inferior to books, theater, film, or newspapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1527476412446088">Mittell 2000</xref>) or whether internet use still generates public anxieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527476412446088">Livingstone 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1527476412446088">Reed 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1527476412446088">Young 2004</xref>). To do this, this article draws on eighty-nine qualitative interviews in which people account for their ICT use in different parts of Finland.</p>
<p>At the outset, it can be said that our interviewees were quite relaxed about their media use. They were happy and willing to tell not only how they read books or use the internet for online banking, but also how they indulge in popular culture genres traditionally considered lowbrow. These data seem to confirm the notion that new communication technologies equalize all cultural products as mere media content, potentially reversing the negative discourse toward lowbrow culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1527476412446088">Peterson and Kern 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1527476412446088">van Eijck 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1527476412446088">Warde et al. 2007</xref>). Yet detailed discursive analysis of the interviewees’ talk reveals that such relaxation of value judgments related to cultural consumption and leisure activities is only ostensible. The interviewees use all kinds of conceptual and discursive means by which to account for their activities. This morally loaded talk reflects the fact that people’s media use is a moral question in several ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476412446088">Alasuutari 1996</xref>). In addition to the questions concerning the highbrow–lowbrow distinction, sitting at the computer takes time, which could be used for other purposes and which therefore needs extra accounting. Therefore it is understandable that interviewees often ennoble their leisure time use with the notion of “hobby.” The changing media landscape makes the situation ever more challenging. The old concepts and frameworks by which people attempt to tame potentially threatening and disquieting elements of the changing media landscape into customary aspects of their ordinary lives are not entirely applicable to the current situation. Thus the speech repertoires produced by the interviewees are interesting as they indicate <italic>how</italic> people deal with the changes discussed and <italic>how</italic> such discursive practices contribute to cultural change.</p>
<p>This article first introduces the data and the methods used, before examining “hobby” as a cultural category. Then we present a detailed analysis of the themes arising from our data. In conclusion, we will relate the results of our empirical analysis to a broader context of the culture of modernity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1527476412446088" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research Material and the Methodological Approach</title>
<p>The research material consists of three distinct data sets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527476412446088">1</xref></sup> Although the primary concern in this research project<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527476412446088">2</xref></sup> was how new communication and information technologies (such as the internet, mobile phones, digital television) entered people’s everyday lives, we also asked people about their “old” media and technology consumption. This meant that we asked about television viewing and newspaper reading as well as computer and mobile phone use. We also asked about their other everyday life routines by asking them to tell a story of a typical day. In addition, we encouraged them to talk about the interiors of their homes and especially to tell how they made decisions concerning the placement of different devices and media artifacts. The interviews were conducted by applying a combination of focused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1527476412446088">Merton et al. 1990</xref>) and narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412446088">Fontana and Frey 2000</xref>) interview techniques.</p>
<p>We approach the research materials from the perspective of social constructionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527476412446088">Burr 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527476412446088">Holstein and Gubrium 2008</xref>) and analyze it by using various methodical lenses generally referred to as discourse analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527476412446088">Burr 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1527476412446088">Potter 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1527476412446088">Potter and Wetherell 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1527476412446088">Wood and Kroger 2000</xref>). Rather than treating our interviews as a means to access individuals’ lives and innermost thoughts, we treat them as interventions through which individuals are prompted to reflect on their lives to us, thus coconstructing the plethora of culturally available speech repertoires to deal with the issues in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527476412446088">Gubrium and Holstein 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1527476412446088">Holstein and Gubrium 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with discourse analysis, this analytical approach may strike as an unexpected way to talk about the interviews. Instead of referring to the interviewees’ statements in the past tense, we use the so-called ethnographic present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1527476412446088">Sanjek 1991</xref>). It treats statements as examples of a culture as forms of talk rather than as information on the particular individuals who gave the statements. It also underlines that the focus is on the interview text, which is here and now for the author and the reader, not something that once took place in the past. Furthermore, we comment on the statements by often resorting to the passive voice or to other forms of expression that deliberately suppresses the agency of the speaker. Commonly used in discourse or conversation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476412446088">Alasuutari 2004</xref>, 81-82), the objective of these stylistic choices is to distance readers from being immersed in interpreting a person’s thoughts, motives, and intentions in order to focus attention on how things are said: what concepts are used and what speech repertoires are evoked.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1527476412446088">
<title>The Cultural Status of the Category “Hobby”</title>
<p>In the interviews, when people talk about their leisure media use, such as using the personal computer and browsing the internet through it, they often employ the cultural category “hobby.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527476412446088">3</xref></sup> Depending on the context, the interviewees may characterize what they do at the computer as a hobby, or explain their internet use by what they call their hobbies. This is understandable; the computer has evolved into a generic tool and a link to the world at large. No matter what people do in their leisure time, they may perform tasks related to it with a computer. In addition, the cultural category of hobby pops up so frequently in the interviews because it functions as a way of framing and justifying leisure activities. Many kinds of media-related activities may be conceived of and presented as hobbies, and in that way they acquire a more serious character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1527476412446088">Luomanen 2010</xref>). The interviewees’ propensity to tacitly or explicitly provide justifications for their free time use is interesting also because it reflects the culture of modernity, one of core ideas of which is that people should be rational and productive in their daily lives and develop themselves also during their spare time.</p>
<p>The use of the word “hobby” is understandable in light of the history of leisure. The word emerged as an ideological construct to distinguish between “good” and “bad” pastimes as part of the battle over the increasing nonwork time of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1527476412446088">Pangburn 1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1527476412446088">Rosenzweig 1983</xref>). During the Great Depression in the United States, for example, political and moral leaders recommended hobbies as a positive way to spend free time. A hobby inferred a useful activity: something that kept people active, developed new skills, or, at least, did not harm them at a time when there were many underemployed and unemployed people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412446088">Gelber 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Current research also reflects the tensions between attitudes toward leisure on the one hand and utility as a key value of modernity on the other. Since some kind of usefulness of a leisure activity is an essential criterion of its acceptability, scholars have conceptualized long-term activities in various ways: for example, as “serious leisure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412446088">Anderson and Taylor 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476412446088">Brown 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476412446088">Hastings et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527476412446088">Jones and Symon 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527476412446088">Kane and Zink 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1527476412446088">Rosenberg 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1527476412446088">Worthington 2005</xref>), “hobbies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527476412446088">Gelber 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527476412446088">Kleif and Faulkner 2003</xref>), “specialized play” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1527476412446088">Sairinen 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1527476412446088">Schlosberg and Rinfret 2008</xref>), “fandom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476412446088">Andrejevic 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476412446088">Booth 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476412446088">Consalvo 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527476412446088">Hills 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527476412446088">Jenkins 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1527476412446088">Nikunen 2007</xref>), and “enthusiasms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476412446088">Abercrombie and Longhurst 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527476412446088">Longhurst 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1527476412446088">Robert Stebbins (1982)</xref> first introduced the terms <italic>casual</italic> and <italic>serious leisure</italic> to distinguish immediate, short-term popular leisure from the kind of activities that require steadier, long-term efforts. He defined casual leisure, such as watching television, as immediately and intrinsically rewarding, requiring only minimal training, but not offering a “personally satisfying and full existence through recreative living” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1527476412446088">Stebbins 2001</xref>, 53). Serious leisure, he countered, is “deeply satisfying,” because it is “the steady pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist or career volunteer activity that captivates its participants with its complexity and many challenges” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1527476412446088">Stebbins 2001</xref>, 54). It has also been argued that serious leisure offers a basis for a lifestyle in which the activity is part of one’s identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412446088">Baldwin and Norris 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1527476412446088">Stebbins 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1527476412446088">Yoder 1997</xref>). Employing this cultural distinction or tension between acceptable and less acceptable pastime activities, it is obvious that when our informants seek to “ennoble” their leisure activities by employing the notion of hobby, they use it as a referent to serious leisure. On the other hand, they often do such ennobling with a bit of self-irony and a playful “camp” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412446088">Harvey 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1527476412446088">Sontag 1990</xref>) attitude toward the distinction between serious and casual pastime activities.</p>
<p>By analyzing how our informants talk about their internet-related leisure activities in this study, we do not try to classify them as members of particular consumer groups or subcultures. Yet such subcultures captured by previous ethnographic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1527476412446088">Lewis 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1527476412446088">McArthur 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1527476412446088">Simon 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1527476412446088">Williams 2006</xref>) are interesting because they provide background for the interviewees’ talk on media use analyzed here. The interviewees employ existing and emergent cultural notions of enthusiasts or fans as conceptual resources by which they manage their image in skilful and playful ways. From the viewpoint of identity construction and justifying certain media uses, when utilizing the concept of hobby or other terms used to categorize leisure activities or individuals engaged in them, people are faced with the ambiguous challenge of standing out while fitting in. Thus, while defining themselves in some ways in opposition to broader culture or the mainstream, they must also find ways to negotiate their activities, likings, and identities within this cultural milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412446088">Anderson and Taylor 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1527476412446088">
<title>Discursive Management of Media Use</title>
<p>In our analysis, we focus on identifying the different discursive means through which people account for, make sense of, or justify their media use. While the cultural category of hobby is central in this respect, people utilize it as a discursive resource in connection with three themes: the highbrow–lowbrow distinction, the notion of addiction, and the speech repertoires related to authenticity and materiality.</p>
<sec id="section5-1527476412446088">
<title>The Highbrow–Lowbrow Distinction</title>
<p>While hobbies as serious leisure are commonly promoted as a preferable way to use one’s leisure time, in the interviews people frame what they do at the computer as hobbies, hence presenting their internet use in a good light and lifting it to a wider context. It also becomes part of a long-term interest, not just a whim. The extract below is a good example.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 1</bold> (Interview No. 64, Woman, 21-30 years)</p>
<p>I’m the kind of person who wants to get information on things. I read a lot and I’ve read a lot of books and that way it’s kind of natural to read and gain information in other ways as well. It’s a continuation of it, the new media I mean.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the extract, the use of new media technologies is legitimated by describing it as a logical continuation of the interviewee’s previous activities, in this case the hobby of reading. As such, she is positioned as a person eager to gain new information regardless of the medium.</p>
<p>A similar positioning of media uses takes place here. This time, though, the interviewee evaluates various channels.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 2</bold> (Interview No. 1, Man, 31-40 years)</p>
<p>I was really rather sceptical, because I really am (sigh) [.] I really am like a book person by default. And really I had the, you know, for a really, really long time, a sort of a division where books were for finding information and the internet was for working and producing texts and also for entertainment of sorts, games and surfing and all that. But it just, you know, at some point the whole conception of internet that I had just changed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this excerpt, the speaker constructs a similar continuum from book reading to internet use, but only after first defining the internet as different from books, and, second, positioning the internet as alien to someone who is a “book person.” The identity of a book person is based on the articulation in which books are associated with information and the internet with entertainment. This tension between books and the internet is then resolved by redefining the internet as another relevant source of information. It is obvious in both of the above extracts that information, particularly associated with books, is given a more positive value than entertainment. Describing internet use as “information seeking” functions as a means to justify its use.</p>
<p>By presenting internet use as the continuation of a prior “highbrow” interest, such as book reading, the interviewees not only introduce it in a favorable light but also construct it as part of a long-term commitment to a hobby. In this instance it is also worth paying attention to the narrative structure employed in extract 2 above. The fact that the person is presented as being initially sceptical toward the internet, works as proof against the potential assumption that he is lured by the internet’s temptations and thus changed as a person. This is a prime example of stake inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1527476412446088">Potter 1996</xref>, 124-28), which is a frequent way that speakers counter the suspicion that their action is motivated by a fashion or by an immediate gratification. That such moral work is done when accounting for internet use tells us about its ambiguous public image.</p>
<p>Interviewees do not only see internet use, however, as a continuation of book reading. For instance, one interviewee (No. 62, Man, 31-40 years) talks at length about his interest in technology and different devices. He compares new technologies to older versions. He describes his interest in the internet in terms of a series of technical solutions. Similarly, another interviewee (No. 65, Man, 15-20 years) tells how his technical interests started at a very young age. He describes himself as a person who is keen on and skillful with technology, as exemplified by a story about how he managed to blow up the power supply unit of the family computer as a toddler. In these interviews, internet use is constructed as a continuation of the informants’ long-term interest in technologies and tinkering with them.</p>
<p>In the interviews, the internet is not only constructed as a simple extension to an existing hobby. It is also described as a “portal” through which an individual’s interest in a phenomenon is deepened and amalgamated with other areas of interest. For example:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 3</bold> (Interview No. 65, Man, 15-20 years)</p>
<p>After that I have put together a kind of, a specific kind of a library of fantasy literature. And then, much like with sci-fi, I was hooked on it through my general hobby of reading (books) and a friend of my sister also got me hooked with a couple of books. In this sense, there was no specific connection, but it is also a technical hobby that for instance it’s been fun to read what they envisioned in the 50s that we’d have by 2000. And when you know a bit more about technology you can ruminate about how realistic those visions have been at the time of writing the book. And why, for what reasons, they did not get it right.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the excerpt, the speaker describes his internet use as a nexus between his two passions—technology and literature—thus invoking a discourse within which the civilized person has technological competence much in the same way he has other types of cultural competence, such as knowing classical literature. This articulation of a “civilized person” can of course be contested; technological competence may also signify a nerd or an “anorak.” In Finland, it has been argued that men are vulnerable to this type of accusation, but only if their interest overrides all other types of cultural competence. Consequently, technological competence belongs to the Finnish ideal of cultural competence, but it is not sufficient on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1527476412446088">Pantzar 2000</xref>, 252).</p>
<p>In another interview, internet use is described as a means of deepening the informant’s interest in TV series. The interviewee (Interview No 64, Woman, 21-30 years) states that using the possibilities provided by the internet has broadened her understanding of the structure and production of TV series. The change not only means that she is now more knowledgeable; it also means she is part of a community of fans:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 4</bold> (Interview No. 64, Woman, 21-30 years)</p>
<p>Yes it’s clearly the internet. I think that my fandom is really all about, you know, the internet has enabled it. I mean simply because I come from a small village and there really was no access to, you know; since I’ve had fantasy literature as my hobby since I was a kid and it was really awfully difficult to get hold of due to the fact that the local library really only had some translated volumes. And back then they hadn’t translated all that much of fantasy literature like they have today. And there was no bookstore that would’ve offered English paperbacks. You know, I had the makings of a fan, or the interest, like a passionate desire to know about something. I got so excited about role-playing games already back then but I didn’t have the access, there were no other people who would have shared the interest. So it could not be the social thing that it really is meant to be.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the extract above, the internet is described as having created genuinely new opportunities that support long-time aspirations related to the media. In addition, social interaction is described as an essential element of this activity. Consequently, the speaker is positioned as a passionate, active, and social person. Furthermore, the efforts spent to get hold of print media in the youth of the interviewee position her as a person who has individually gained the interest through print media and who now continues this original interest with the help of the new media.</p>
<p>To summarize what has been pointed out above, hobby is an important means by which people make sense of and justify their internet use to themselves and for others. Through this concept individuals are able to build a bridge between the present and the past before the internet Age, allowing them to construct their individuality as stable despite change. Having something as a hobby enables people to depict their internet use as active, and often in the company of fellow hobbyists, the concept of “hobby” counters the potential assumption that a person spending much time at the computer or with other media is the passive recipient of dumbing entertainment. The emphasis on one’s active agency may also be used as a means to frame an interest in a questionable or lowbrow phenomenon in a culturally acceptable light.</p>

<sec id="section6-1527476412446088">
<title>Addiction</title>
<p>Our material also shows that different forms of media can only be properly understood in relation to one another. This can be seen in the ways in which informants speak against prevalent discourses that entail assumptions about a cultural hierarchy of different media and media content when accounting for their media use. Underlying these assumptions, internet use and popular culture are suspect cases and they tend to require extra accounting for when discussed. For example, people may utilize self-irony or engage in elaborate discursive work in order to manage their positions as responsible media consumers who are not uncritical, let alone addicted to light entertainment.</p>
<p>Consider extract 5 below. This is a good example of how people can utilize self-irony in order to present lowbrow media uses as part of an educated person’s media repertoire.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 5</bold> (Interview No. 64, Woman, 21-30 years)</p>
<p>Everybody everywhere is searching the internet for information about everything, especially as I too have a broadband internet account at home. I live in a dormitory and I’ve had a broadband account for several years already, the time that I’ve lived there. And I also have an access at work, so basically I have it all the time. I can at any time, turn to the computer just to check out the internet movie database for some really silly trivia, since the threshold to use the net is so [low] because there is no fee per minute, just the general monthly fee, so you can really splurge out with it, you can just check out whatever you wish.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the extract, the speaker describes how her internet use is combined with watching something on TV in real time. Later on in the interview she gives an example about watching the TV serial <italic>Alias</italic>. During the show, she and her partner started to wonder where that particular episode was in terms of production seasons. She then explains how she “dug up” an episode guide and then relishes the fact that she had already thought of the episode as a season midpoint, which it was. In this way, the speaker presents herself as a true fan of and expert on the show. On the other hand, by referring to the information about the program checked out online as “really silly trivia,” she positions herself as a culturally competent person in the double sense of a camp sensibility.</p>
<p>The preceding informant emphasizes that her internet affects the way she consumes TV series. No longer is she content to just watch a series “episode after episode after episode.” Instead, she has a deeper understanding from extra information about the structure of production seasons. As such, the informant wards off the possible interpretation that she is merely a passive or innocent viewer. Her fan identity as an active information seeker, along with other consumer-generated information, blurs the line between consumers and producers. The way she constructs herself rebuffs the potential assumption that such individuals are uncritical consumers of popular culture.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 6</bold> (Interview No. 64, Woman, 21-30 years)</p>
<p>I’m that sort of a fan in that I—since I’m always in such a hurry—I really limit very carefully what I watch on television and what movies I will watch and what sort of things I will then get totally carried away with—so much so that I’ll have to get all the related collector’s items. And also, on the other hand, there is this thing that you want to stay on top of it all and cherry pick those things that are truly of interest to yourself and then really get into those.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the extract above, the expression “I’m that sort of a fan,” the interviewee leaves open the possibility that there are naive, uncritical fans, but, comparatively, she is a critical consumer that only gets “carried away” by carefully selected programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527476412446088">Costello and Moore 2007</xref>). In the excerpt, the interviewee is not only positioned as a critical user of these cultural products but also a person who maintains a broad understanding about the range of products available.</p>
<p>In the previous extract, the speaker also constructs an interesting tension between a fan’s passion for and a fan’s addiction to a TV series or movie and the self-control one must use to select the objects of his or her enthusiasm. It is a good illustration of the ways in which both strong and weak agency may be used to present oneself as a moral agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1527476412446088">Kurri and Wahlstrom 2001</xref>). By expressing that she “has to” get all sorts of paraphernalia related to her favorite programmes, she appears to describe herself as a person who has been “carried away” by them, but by using such agentless talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1527476412446088">Kurri and Wahlstrom 2007</xref>) she displays awareness of the popular conviction that one should not become too addicted to, say, light entertainment. She presents herself as a responsible observer of her potentially questionable actions. On the other hand, by stressing that she carefully selects the shows she indulges in, she counterbalances the potential impression of an uncritical fan. Through emphasizing that she is busy and focuses intensively on only a few specific TV series, she constructs an image of herself as a person who has a lot of activities in her life other than those offered by the media, and that she is also capable of critically discerning what things in her life are worth spending time on.</p>
<p>In the next extract she describes this process in terms of typical phases:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 7</bold> (Interview No. 64, Woman, 21-30 years)</p>
<p>I can tell you how it usually goes. I read the <italic>TV-maailma</italic> (<italic>TV World</italic>) magazine, which I buy weekly, and browse through encircling every programme that I find interesting. And particularly those that I really want to watch and tape to keep or just to watch later. . . .</p>
<p>The TV world is great as it presents the new series well and it’s not just, you know, presented in a sort of teenage enthusiasm that this is so cool just because this is so cool. Instead they usually have genuine opinions about the series and usually quite to the point. And when I have viewed a couple of episodes and actually find the series good, I will easily start to look up more information and I will—I may get a new desktop wallpaper and maybe download the theme song mp3 from the internet and . . . well, perhaps also dig out an episode guide and whether there is other stuff available from these people and whether there are mailings lists dedicated to the series and stuff. But, you know, the TV series or some other thing has to be really interesting in itself to begin with.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here again, the interviewee constructs herself as an active user of media. The excerpt also shows well how the utilization of several media is used to construct morally responsible agency. In explaining how she not only watches television or surfs the internet but also consults a TV magazine, the interviewee also displays her awareness that reviews of TV shows may be of varying quality and thus more or less useful. The internet is described as providing further information (and artifacts such as ring tones and wallpapers) once a programme or a series has been found truly worthwhile. Notably it is not presented as the starting point in this process. This additional information serves to provide one with an expanded understanding of the series in question. One is no longer forced to just consume the programmes episode by episode but instead can readily amass a lot of information and thus grasp the series as a whole, being able to place it within various contexts (genre, director’s filmography, and such).</p>
<p>By describing their complementary use of different media, informants deny they are addicted to any one form. Rather, they are able to resignify, both for themselves and for others, their activities related to various media. Thus, say, indulging in a “silly” TV serial may be seen as a “serious” hobby and as evidence of expert knowledge on the production of TV drama just as browsing the internet can be viewed as a form of study alongside the use of other sources of information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1527476412446088">
<title>Authenticity and Artifacts</title>
<p>A central empirical observation in this article is that people use references to artifacts as an essential discursive resource facilitating meaning making of media use in the new media environment. Our data show, however, that the meanings related to media artifacts and their display in the home are challenged, renewed, and renegotiated when new devices and media artifacts are domesticated into everyday lives.</p>
<p>The extract below is a good example how informants place emphasis on various media-related products or artifacts, which are integral elements of their media use in everyday life.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 8</bold> (Interview No. 64, Woman, 21-30 years)</p>
<p>Now I’ve really gone nuts about all sorts of silly stuff like <italic>Sailor Moon</italic> on SubTV. And, you know, it’s really a TV programme but the fact is that my being a fan is not restricted to the TV series and is not really primarily about it but, also, you know, it’s anime and I have manga stuff in my bookshelf, the cartoons that it’s based on. And now, little by little, all sorts of paraphernalia have started to accumulate, like posters and stuff. But really the Manga hit me first and then they made a TV series out of it, although it really landed in Finland with the TV series first. But, you know, the second type of fandom is somewhat less or it’s like that I won’t get so into it as to gather all sorts of related stuff. Er, let’s put it this way, it’s often about a TV series that you have like <italic>Babylon 5</italic> and, well, <italic>Farscape</italic> as well, and some other such series that you <italic>really</italic> must see all the episodes of. And if you should miss one, then someone’s going to have it on DVD or something and then you start feeling like you should get them to your bookshelf.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As in the excerpts discussed in previous sections, in extract 8 the informant also speaks against an assumed cultural hierarchy of different genres and media, though printed products are once again described as the starting point for her interest. Also in this case, the speaker presents herself with weak agency or resorts to agentless talk when describing her hobby; seeing all episodes is presented as an absolute must, and paraphernalia have started to accumulate by themselves. These word choices portray her fandom and herself in a humorous light, presenting herself as a morally conscious observer of questionable activities.</p>
<p>In this instance, the collection of paraphernalia related to a TV series is presented as an integral part of fan activity. She describes owning and collecting of artifacts beyond the DVD series as marking the difference between being an all-out fan or something less intense. One reason for the importance placed on artifacts could be that they make fandom more concrete and tangible for the individual in several ways. For one thing, collecting these artifacts is an investment both in terms of money and time. Second, as is referred to at the end of extract 8, owning, borrowing, and lending them links an individual to a social group of other fans, and facilitates social interaction. Describing this interaction positions the speaker as part of a legitimate group instead of a being a single “freak.”</p>
<p>Artifacts are also ostensibly signs of the individual’s interests to outsiders, or more precisely, to people who visit the home in which they are displayed. Thus we should not take for granted that, for instance in the case discussed above, these artifacts are placed and displayed on a bookshelf. Their placement is mentioned several times during the interview. Accounting for such a spatial arrangement merges these artifacts with others traditionally considered as “highbrow.”</p>
<p>Artifacts are not only connected to the surrounding culture as individual objects but as collections. Accounting for complete collections of artifacts has particular weight in terms of explaining one’s perspective toward the contents, because a complete collection legitimates one’s authentic interest as well as one’s ability to critique those contents as parts of the overall popular culture landscape. Consider the following extract in which the interviewer has just asked for a concrete accounting of the interviewee’s media use on the prior evening.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 9</bold> (Interview No. 69, Woman, 31-40 years)</p>
<p>Actually we’ve now been watching the third season of the <italic>Moonlightning</italic>, which is, which is the best that television offered in the ’80s. And probably yesterday we watched two episodes. So, usually as we come home we make some dinner and then at the same time we watch whatever series we’ve been following for an episode or two. And comic books I probably did not read, but I actually just finished the whole span [all the series] of <italic>The Invisibles</italic> comic books. It’s pretty psychedelic so I had to kind of take a little break.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, describing a single show as the best that ’80s television had to offer legitimates watching the TV series. This is not only to say that the series in question is particularly good, but that the interviewee can assess the series in the context of the whole of 1980s culture. One interpretation of this is that the series is not necessarily seen as an excellent product but it is compared to the banality of the 1980s in general, a decade generally associated with bad taste. Thus, collections and their relationships to the surrounding culture are accounted for in order to display a culturally conscious relationship with the media.</p>
<p>According to our data, owning a TV series on DVD means that one can watch them at leisure, enabling the viewer to commit to a series in a new way. The following extract sheds light on this phenomenon. Prior to this, the interviewee stated that she seeks for information online about potential TV series that she might be interested in.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 10</bold> (Interview No. 70, Woman, 31-40 years)</p>
<p>Question: So do you search for information about some, for instance if you don’t have a season [of a TV series] that is this worth watching or so?</p>
<p>Answer: Well not in the sense that if I have decided that I’ll commit to a series then I can just as well purchase all the episodes. Of course, I’ll do a little search in Amazon and other places to see how they have been rated but it does not really have an impact on my buying decision.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interestingly, the interviewee describes making the decision to “commit to” a series before actually watching the show at all. According to her description, her decision to invest in all the DVDs was made with the help of a background search on an internet movie database or the home pages of a TV series, but she accounts for her decision as an individual assessment. Even if she looks up the show’s ratings online, the final decision is hers. A commitment is born as one invests in the artifacts that pertain to the series. Before the era of widely available, affordable DVD box sets (through Amazon, for example), such accounting for media use was not possible.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article we set out to question how people in the new media environment organize their lives and negotiate their choices and principles in relation to prevalent discourses about proper conduct and legitimate media content. The results of our discursive analysis show that informants tell in a relaxed fashion about their practices, with hardly any concerns about, say, addiction to internet use, gaming or different media content. Yet the interviewees’ talk is discursively dense, full of ways to represent proper conduct or justify practices. Discursive analysis of people’s talk revealed that mentally and culturally adjusting to the new digital media environment warrants such elaborate accounts. These discursive techniques are interesting because they tell us about underlying premises and cultural hierarchies internalized by the informants.</p>
<p>One recurrent feature in these accounts is that the cultural category of hobby is used to give an overall framework and justification for media use. Through the concept of hobby, they present their particular media uses as serious or long-term activities, distinguishing them from shallow and random media consumption. On the one hand, hobbies are important for people, but, on the other hand, talk about hobbies is a discursive strategy. Hobbies are utilized as a speech repertoire that brings internet use into a wider context. Simultaneously, the informants stress continuity in their lives. Individual authenticity is discursively built by showing how their present activity is a pursuit of interests that began at an earlier age.</p>
<p>The data also illustrate how people relate their accounts of hobbies to prevalent cultural values, which regard internet use and TV viewing as questionable activities. By describing their complementary use of different media, however, they are able to challenge these “default” assumptions. Thus, being a fan of a popular TV show may be turned into a serious hobby and as evidence of the individual’s expertise in the inside world of drama production. Accounting for an interest whose origin typically lies in print media creates authenticity, just as owning and displaying media artifacts does. In the data, people mostly justified the internet in relation to television and print media, as these established media provide good points of reference in the domestication process. In interview talk the internet is constructed as an extension of an existing hobby (e.g., reading or a general interest in technology), which elevates internet use. After this, it is typically accounted for as a portal, through which the individual’s interest is deepened and developed further. This discursive strategy first acknowledges default cultural value constellations and then blurs them. In order to cogently account for this, one first has to establish the prevalent value hierarchies of highbrow and lowbrow culture.</p>
<p>When justifying their uses of the internet in these ways, people resort to the highbrow–lowbrow distinction and definitions of addiction, which contributes to their reproduction as social discourses. The interviewees’ use of self-irony and camp dampens this to a degree. When, for instance, consumption of pornography is characterized as one’s hobby, it appears to ennoble the activity but also makes fun of the use of the concept of hobby as a justification strategy. Such a camp attitude does not mean that traditional values are entirely reversed. The skillfulness in accounting for one’s media use and in ridiculing standard justifications can be seen as yet another strategy, which works by making it clear to the interviewer that the speaker is well aware of prevalent values and able to reflect them through their accounts of consumption activities. Describing the use of the internet to inform but not determine which artifacts to collect allows people to emphasize their authenticity and authority and to give meaning to media-related products as artifacts. Regardless of their actual practices, they invoke artifact possession regularly to mark the difference between an authentic long-term interest and shallow, random interests.</p>
<p>Given that our analysis has primarily concentrated on people’s talk in an interview situation, it is important to ask what the discourses we have analyzed tell us about realities other than that of the interview context, for instance, about people’s actual media use. Or to put it another way around, why is it interesting to study media use discourses rather than media uses? In a sense it is self-evident that the justifying discourses concerning people’s practices are invoked by the interview situation, in which a stranger asks individuals about their personal lives. However, these discourses are not invented in that situation; people resort to culturally available speech repertoires concerning the new media environment as well as acceptable and questionable behavior more generally. Such discourses are contradictory as they do not directly reflect our innermost opinions or actual behaviors. They do reflect the ways reality is conceived in that culture and serve as yardsticks for assessing our actions.</p>
<p>Media use discourses stress positive values associated with individuals’ agency and culturally ingrained hierarchies of media genres, products, and tastes. We suggest that these two features are in fact interlinked. They reflect the “civic religion” of contemporary advanced economies, according to which our duty is to continuously develop ourselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476412446088">Alasuutari 2006</xref>). Although media use primarily takes place during our leisure time, it is time-consuming, and time is spent away from other activities, for instance, household chores or associating with our friends and families. This is why high culture is generally preferred over light entertainment, because it is traditionally thought that serious art has an “uplifting,” civilizing function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1527476412446088">Miller and Yúdice 2002</xref>). For the same reason, an active and goal-directed role in using the internet is preferred over purposeless surfing. The results of this study show that although traditional hierarchies are blurred and changed in the new digital media environment, underlying premises about culturally acceptable actions, and indeed the purpose of life remains unchanged.</p>

<p>The main analysis was based on a first data set consisting of sixty-eight interviews conducted in various parts of Finland (from summer 2001 till summer 2003). In this data set there were sixty-one women and thirty-nine men from various educational backgrounds. Most of the interviewees were employed. A second data set consisted of two interviews that were carried out in 2007 for the specific purpose of gathering in-depth data about the themes of the article. Both interviewees were female university graduates and employed. In a third study, nineteen interviews were carried out in 2009 and 2010. There were ten men and nine women from various educational backgrounds. Sixteen of these were employed, two were unemployed, and one on a maternity leave.</p>

<p>Since the interviews were conducted in Finnish, the actual word used was <italic>harraste</italic>. This noun stems from the adjective <italic>harras</italic>, which can be translated as devoted, as in <italic>harras kristitty</italic> (devoted Christian). In that sense, harraste depicts an object of devotion. However, despite this literary meaning, one’s relationship to a <italic>harraste</italic> is not necessarily so serious. In that sense the word carries about the same meaning as hobby.</p>
