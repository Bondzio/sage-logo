<abstract>
<p>Impulsivity is characteristic of several mental health disorders and is largely mediated by the prefrontal cortex subregions: the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) are known to modulate activity of the prefrontal cortex, however their direct role in impulsive choice is not known. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of microinjecting DA or NE compounds in the mPFC or OFC on impulsive choice as measured by a delayed reinforcement (DR) task in male Wistar Kyoto rats. Following training in the DR task, rats were pretreated with DA D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists (SCH23390 3 μg/side, raclopride 3 or 6 μg/side) or NE α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> receptor agonists (phenylephrine 0.1 or 0.3 μg/side, guanfacine 1 or 3 μg/side, respectively) into the mPFC or OFC and the effect on impulsive behavior was assessed. Pretreatment with raclopride into the mPFC or OFC significantly increased impulsive choice, however only pretreatment with SCH23390 into the mPFC, and not the OFC, significantly increased impulsive choice. Pretreatment with the NE receptor agonists had no effect on impulsive choice. This study suggests that DA receptors, but not NE receptors, differentially mediate impulsive choice in sub-regions of the prefrontal cortex.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Impulsivity is a characteristic of many disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance abuse, conduct disorder and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112465497">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) and can be broadly defined as action without consideration of the consequences. Impulsivity can be divided into two categories: impulsive action which is the inability to inhibit a motor response; and impulsive choice which is the preference to receive a small, immediate reward over a larger, delayed reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269881112465497">Winstanley et al., 2006</xref>). Delayed reinforcement (DR) paradigms are commonly used in laboratories as a measure of impulsive choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112465497">Cardinal et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112465497">Evenden and Ryan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112465497">Mobini et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Impulsivity is a higher level cognitive function controlled by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881112465497">Kim and Lee, 2011</xref>) in concert with direct and indirect connections to subcortical regions such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112465497">Cardinal et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881112465497">Pothuizen et al., 2005</xref>). The regulation of the PFC depends upon the state of arousal of the subject which influences levels of the catecholamines, dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112465497">Deutch et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112465497">Foote et al., 1980</xref>). The inverted U relationship between DA, NE and PFC function indicates that extreme levels of DA and NE are detrimental to PFC functioning, whilst optimal PFC function requires moderate levels of DA and NE neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112465497">Arnsten, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112465497">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The catecholamines control the function of the PFC through the activation of specific receptor subtypes. With optimal, moderate levels of NE and DA, PFC function is predominantly controlled by the activation of α<sub>2A</sub> and D<sub>1</sub> receptors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112465497">Arnsten, 1997</xref>). NE stimulation of the α<sub>2A</sub> receptors enhances PFC function by strengthening appropriate neural networks, increasing the ‘signal’. In contrast, D<sub>1</sub> receptor stimulation enhances PFC function by weakening inappropriate neural connections, decreasing ‘noise’ in the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112465497">Arnsten, 1997</xref>). In periods of excessive NE levels in the PFC, lower-affinity α<sub>1</sub> receptors are engaged, which suppresses PFC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112465497">Birnbaum et al., 2004</xref>). High levels of DA in the PFC also inappropriately suppress PFC function for working memory tasks through excessive stimulation of D<sub>1</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881112465497">Vijayraghavan et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous investigations into the role of DA and NE in impulsivity have employed systemic administration of specific receptor agonists and antagonists. From these studies both DA D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors have been shown to be involved in impulsive choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112465497">Van Gaalen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269881112465497">Wade et al., 2000</xref>). NE has also been implicated in impulsivity as the inhibition of NE transporters has been shown to decrease impulsive choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881112465497">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>), with an increase in impulsive choice following systemic administration of a NE α<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist but not an α<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112465497">Van Gaalen et al., 2006</xref>). These studies support a role for DA and NE neurotransmission in impulsive choice, though the use of systemic administration of each compound limits the interpretation of the precise neurobiology of these effects. We aim to extend these findings to suggest the specific effects of catecholamine receptor activation in sub-regions of the PFC, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) on impulsive choice.</p>
<p>Lesions of the OFC have been shown to influence responding in DR measures of impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112465497">Mobini et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269881112465497">Winstanley et al., 2004</xref>), although these results have been inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269881112465497">Zeeb et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, dopaminergic lesions of the OFC produced aversion to increasing delays, which was offset by the increased value attributed to the reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112465497">Kheramin et al., 2004</xref>). Lesions of the medial mPFC do not reportedly influence delay-specific effects in impulsive choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112465497">Cardinal et al., 2001</xref>), yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112465497">Loos and colleagues (2010)</xref> recently reported a correlation between impulsivity and the gene expression of DA D<sub>1</sub> receptors specifically within the mPFC. Furthermore, they found that infusion of a DA D<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist into the mPFC increased impulsive choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112465497">Loos et al., 2010</xref>). As investigations have not been conducted to assess the effect of local PFC infusions of DA D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists or NE receptor agonists on impulsive choice, the present study was conducted to expand and extend the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112465497">Loos and colleagues (2010)</xref> by investigating the role DA and NE play in impulsive choice as directly mediated by the mPFC and OFC.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to measure changes in impulsive choice following local infusions of DA receptor antagonists or NE receptor agonists into the mPFC or OFC. Based on the inverted-U catecholamine theory of PFC function, it was anticipated that blockade of the DA D<sub>1</sub> receptor will increase impulsive choice with little to no effect of DA D<sub>2</sub> antagonism, while stimulation of the α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> receptors will increase and decrease impulsive choice, respectively.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Sixty male Wistar Kyoto (WKY, Animal Resources Centre, Canning Vale, WA, Australia) rats were housed individually in plastic tubs (60 x 21.5 x 36 cm, length x height x width) containing sawdust, a block of wood and shredded paper, covered with a raised wire mesh roof (27 cm height). The animal holding room was held at a constant temperature of 21°C. Rats were housed on a reverse light/dark cycle (lights on at 18:00 until 06:00) and experiments were conducted during the rats’ active (dark) cycle. At the time of surgery, the rats mean (±standard error of the mean (SEM)) weight was 289 (±2.06) g, they had been handled daily for one week and were experimentally naïve. The rats were allowed free access to water and standard laboratory rat chow, except during the behavioral task where food was restricted to maintain their body weight at approximately 85% of their free feeding weight.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Macquarie University Animal Ethics Committee and followed the <italic>Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112465497">National Health and Medical Research Council, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881112465497">
<title>Surgical procedure</title>
<p>Each rat had intracranial surgery under anesthesia induced by 3% isoflurane in oxygen (2 L/min), for the bilateral implantation of 10 mm guide cannulae (26 gauge) into the mPFC or OFC. The rat was placed in the stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, California, USA), with the nose bar set at −3.3 mm. Using co-ordinates obtained from the rat brain atlas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881112465497">Paxinos and Watson (1998)</xref>, guide cannulae were placed bilaterally into either the OFC (Anterior/Posterior (AP): +3.5; Medial/Lateral (ML): ±2.5; Dorsal/Ventral (DV): –3.2); or mPFC (AP: +3.2; ML: ±1; DV: –3.0). The cannulae remained in place by cranioplastic cement and four machine screws implanted in the skull. Small stylets matching the length of the cannulae (wire 33 gauge thickness) were placed in each cannulae to keep them clean and clear. The rats had seven days of recovery prior to commencement of operant training.</p>

<sec id="section5-0269881112465497">
<title>Drugs</title>
<p>All drugs were obtained from Sigma (St Louis, Missouri, USA). SCH23390 was dissolved in distilled water and raclopride, phenylephrine or guanfacine were dissolved in saline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881112465497">
<title>DR task</title>
<p>The DR task used in this experiment was based on the DR task described in more detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881112465497">Pardey et al., (2009)</xref>. Twenty-four hours prior to the commencement of the task the rats were placed on food restriction. To perform the task, the rats were placed in operant conditioning chambers in which the test wall contained two cue lights above two levers, on either side of a food magazine. The food reinforcer was 45 mg Noyes Precision Pellets, Formula A (Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA).</p>
<sec id="section7-0269881112465497">
<title>Training phase</title>
<p>During their daily training phase, the rats associated the depression of one lever with the delivery of a small (one pellet) immediate reinforcer, and the other lever with the delivery of a large (five pellets) reinforcer after a delay of 2 s. During the delay, the cue light above the lever flashed. The daily session was complete when the rat had made 30 successful responses, or 30 min had expired. The criteria required to move onto the delay phase was 30 successful responses within 30 min across three consecutive days. All rats acquired the task within seven days of training.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269881112465497">
<title>Delay phase</title>
<p>On each day of the delay phase, the rats received a reminder trial to begin the session which was identical to the training session. Following these reminder trials, the delayed trials began. In these trials the rats were allowed to choose which lever they pressed and therefore which reinforcement they received. The reinforcer associated with the small immediate lever (one pellet) remained constant throughout the delay phase. If the rats chose the delayed lever, they received five pellets after a delay period as indicated below. As with the training phase, during the delay period the cue light flashed until the reinforcer was delivered. In order to test for increases or decreases in impulsive choice, the delay level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881112465497">Table 1</xref>) was manipulated so that the rats chose the delayed reinforcer approximately 50% of the time (13–18 times out of 30 trials) to establish their baseline level of responding. Starting with delay level 1 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881112465497">Table 1</xref>), the rats needed to achieve six delayed reinforcers at the first time period (delay block at 0 s) before they would experience the next delay period within that level (delay block at 1 s). Following 6 more reinforcements at the delay lever they would then progress to the next delay block etc. If the rats chose the delayed reinforcer more than 80% of the time across the 30 trials at that delay level, they then progressed to delay level 2 on the following day. This progression in delay level continued across days until approximately 50% of responding occurred to receive the DR. Once stable at 50% delayed reinforcers at a particular delay level, the test phase commenced. Stability was measured as a deviation of less than two delayed lever responses across two sequential non-treatment days and was confirmed using a 2 way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (delay response×day).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The daily session during the delay phase was complete when the rat had made 30 successful choices, or the session was terminated at an adjusted time out for that delay level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881112465497">Table 1</xref>). Some rats were willing to accept long delays between depression of the delay lever and delivery of the reward. In order to allow for all 30 delayed reinforcers to be chosen, the session time out was extended for delay levels 7 and 8 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881112465497">Table 1</xref>). All rats readily made 30 successful choices, and no session in the delay phase was terminated due to time restrictions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269881112465497">
<title>Testing phase</title>
<p>Each test day session used the same procedure as the delay phase, however the test days had no time restrictions to complete the session. As the sessions did not time out, the rats had to make 30 choices to complete the task. This ensured that the task was measuring the treatment effect on impulsive choice, not on locomotor activity. Following an initial sham microinjection day, bilateral microinjections commenced.</p>
<p>A microinjection involved removing the stylets from the cannulae, swabbing the surface of the cranioplastic cement with 70% ethanol, and inserting 11 mm microinjectors (33 gauge) into each cannulae. Each microinjector extended 1 mm beyond the tip of the cannula into the brain region of interest. The prescribed dose was administered over a period of one minute via a Hamilton syringe (1 µL) and infusion pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, Massachusetts, USA). The injectors remained in place for 30 s following dosing to allow infusion of the total drug dose. The injectors were then removed and the stylets replaced. The rats were then immediately placed in the chambers and the number of delayed reinforcers across the 30 trials was measured.</p>
<p>The rats had a minimum of 72 h between each dose. During this time, the rats experienced daily sessions as per the delay phase to ensure that their baseline responding had not changed due to the most recent microinjection. Stability between microinjections was assessed as per the delay phase. The delay level was adjusted where necessary to facilitate this.</p>
<p>On each test day of the DR task, rats received bilateral microinjections of either DA receptor antagonists or NE receptor agonists into their mPFC or OFC. Different groups of rats were used for each neurotransmitter such that group 1 (mPFC, <italic>n</italic>=15) and group 2 (OFC, <italic>n</italic>=15) received DA receptor antagonists and group 3 (mPFC, <italic>n</italic>=15) and 4 (OFC, <italic>n</italic>=15) received NE receptor agonists.</p>
<p>Rats that received DA receptor antagonists were injected with each of distilled water (VEH), SCH23390 3 μg/side (SCH3), raclopride 3 μg/side (RAC3) or 6 μg/side (RACH6), following a Latin square design. DA receptor antagonist doses injected into the mPFC were given in a volume of 0.5 μL and doses injected into the OFC were given in a volume of 0.3 μL. Doses were based on work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269881112465497">Winter and colleagues (2009)</xref> assessing DA receptor involvement in behavioral flexibility mediated by the mPFC and OFC.</p>
<p>Rats that received NE receptor agonists were injected with either saline (VEH), phenylephrine 0.1 µg/side (PHENL.1) or 0.3 μg/side (PHENH.3), guanfacine 1 μg/side (GUANL1) or 3 μg/side (GUANH3), following a Latin square design. Phenylephrine doses were based on the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112465497">Arnsten and colleagues (1999)</xref> assessing the effect of the NA α<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist in the PFC on working spatial memory. Guanfacine doses were based on research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112465497">Ji and colleagues (2008)</xref> assessing the role of the NA α<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist on electrophysiological responses in the mPFC. The electrophysiological effect of intra mPFC injection of guanfacine was similar to that induced by systemic guanfacine administration, at doses known to alter working memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112465497">Ji et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The rats were placed back on ad libitum access to food following the daily session after their final microinjection dose. One week after completion of the task, the rats were anesthetised with pentobarbitone and euthanized via intracardial perfusion with 100 mL of saline followed by 100 mL of 4% formaldehyde in saline. Their brains were removed, sectioned by cryostat, slide mounted and stained with cresyl violet to confirm cannulae placement into the regions of interest.</p>

<sec id="section10-0269881112465497">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Analyses were conducted using ANOVA. The general linear model was used with Greenhouse-Geisser Epsilon (G-G) adjustments for the univariate statistics reported when the assumption of sphericity was violated. Analyses were conducted separately for each region of interest within the the DA and NE treatments. Initially, a repeated measures analysis was conducted to assess the individual variability of the delay level on which rats were tested. There was no significant difference in delay level used across treatments within animal. However, in order to control for individual differences in delay level between the rats on test days, the ‘average delay level’ was included as a between subjects factor in all analyses. Repeated measures analyses were conducted on the total delayed reinforcers attained and time (s) to complete the test session on a treatment day, separately for each region of interest. As all rats were required to complete 30 successful lever selections (delay or immediate), only analysis of the delayed lever responses has been presented. For the rats treated with DA receptor antagonists there were four levels of the within subjects factor, ‘treatment’ (VEH, SCH3, RAC3, and RACH6), five levels of the within subjects factor, ‘delay block’ (1–5) with a between subjects factor, ‘average delay level’ for each region. For the rats treated with NE receptor agonists there were five levels of the within subjects factor ‘treatment’ (VEH, PHENL.1, PHENH.3, GUANL1, and GUANH3), five levels of the within subjects factor, ‘delay block’ (1–5) with a between subjects factor, ‘average delay level’ for each region. Planned contrasts were conducted to compare the effect of each drug to VEH within each region of interest using a Fischer’s least squared difference adjustment.</p>

<title>Effect of dopamine receptor antagonists on delayed reinforcer choice</title>
<p>Of the rats that received bilateral PFC microinjections, one rat was lost due to unstable responding following sham microinjection and two were lost due to blocked cannulae. In total, six rats were removed from the analysis due to misplacement of one or both of their cannulae. As a result, the mPFC and OFC groups each had 10 rats, see cannulae placement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881112465497">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study was conducted to assess the role of DA and NE receptors in impulsive choice as mediated by two sub-regions of the PFC. The results indicate that blockade of the DA D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors differentially increased impulsive choice, depending upon their location in the PFC. However, in the current study NE receptor agonism had no effect on impulsive choice in either brain region.</p>
<p>Antagonism of either the DA D<sub>1</sub> or the D<sub>2</sub> receptor type in the mPFC increased impulsive choice. The effect on impulsive choice of administration of the D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist, raclopride, was dose-dependent, with only the high dose producing a significant increase in impulsive choice. With respect to responding following infusion into the OFC, D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism increased impulsive choice at either dose, with no effect of the local infusion of the D<sub>1</sub> antagonist SCH23390.</p>
<p>In line with previous research reporting increased impulsive choice of OFC lesioned rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112465497">Mobini et al., 2002</xref>), the current study observed elevated impulsive choice following blockade of the D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the OFC. The involvement of both D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors in impulsive choice mediated by the mPFC is also consistent with reports of increased impulsive choice with systemic administration of D<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112465497">Van Gaalen et al., 2006</xref>) and D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269881112465497">Wade et al., 2000</xref>). The current findings also agree with the recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112465497">Loos and colleagues (2010)</xref> demonstrating impulsivity following mPFC infusion of the D<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist SCH23390. However, our current findings are inconsistent with previous lesion studies of the mPFC which report no effect on impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112465497">Cardinal et al., 2001</xref>) and those reporting reduced impulsivity following OFC lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269881112465497">Winstanley et al., 2004</xref>). This disparity likely reflects the neurobiological differences between using excitotoxic lesions which non-selectively remove cell functioning, compared to the current study which served to directly modulate DA receptors in the PFC subregions on measures of impulsive choice.</p>
<p>Similar regional specificity of the DA D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptor function has been reported following repeated psychostimulant administration. Chronic treatment with cocaine has been shown to impair the PFC mediated task of reversal learning which has been associated with impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112465497">Jenstch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112465497">Jentsch and Taylor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881112465497">Schoenbaum et al., 2004</xref>). Cocaine sensitization has also been associated with reduced functioning of postsynaptic DA D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881112465497">Steketee, 2003</xref>). Under normal circumstances, stimulation of mPFC DA D<sub>2</sub> receptors has been reported to directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881112465497">Law-Tho et al., 1994</xref>) and indirectly via gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112465497">Grobin and Deutch, 1998</xref>) inhibit output pyramidal neurons. When DA D<sub>2</sub> receptor function is reduced, in the case of cocaine sensitization, there is a decrease in the inhibition of the pyramidal neurons resulting in an increase in excitatory output to the NAc. Together with the current study, these data suggest that reductions in the function of DA D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the mPFC and OFC contribute to increased impulsive choice. Moreover, the increase in impulsive choice following DA D<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonism in the mPFC, but not the OFC is consistent with findings reporting regional specificity in the role of the D<sub>1</sub> receptor in subregions of the PFC in cocaine sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112465497">Beyer and Steketee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881112465497">Sorg et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>An unexpected finding of the present study was the lack of effect of NE receptor agonist administration into either subregion of the PFC on impulsive choice. This finding is inconsistent with increased impulsive choice following systemic administration of the α<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist clonidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112465497">Van Gaalen et al., 2006</xref>). Task differences are an unlikely explanation for these inconsistent results as very similar DR tasks were employed in both studies. The differences in these results may be due to the receptor selectivity of each drug, as guanfacine is highly selective for the α<sub>2A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112465497">Arnsten et al., 1996</xref>). Activation of the α<sub>2A</sub> receptor occurs during periods of optimal PFC functioning, with stimulation of the α<sub>2A</sub> receptor strengthening appropriate connections and increasing the ‘signal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881112465497">Li et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269881112465497">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). As clonidine stimulates both α<sub>2</sub> and imidazoline receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112465497">Van Zwieten, 1999</xref>), the increased impulsive choice observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112465497">Van Gaalen and colleagues (2006)</xref> may have resulted from stimulation of the imidazoline receptors. Moreover, clonidine has been shown to inhibit DA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881112465497">Sica, 2007</xref>), a property not observed with guanfacine. This interpretation is also consistent with the integral role of DA in impulsive choice observed in the current study. The local administration of α<sub>2</sub> receptor agonists may also have reduced any side effects, such as sedation, that may have contributed to the systemic drug effect on impulsive choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112465497">Buerkle and Yaksh, 1998</xref>). In the current study, pretreatment with NE receptor agonists directly into either the mPFC or OFC did not alter the time for animals to complete the DR task.</p>
<p>Lesions of the PFC can alter motor inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112465497">Muir et al., 1996</xref>), and here we show that the administration of SCH23390 to either the mPFC or OFC also significantly delayed the time to completion of the test session, suggesting a level of motor inhibition. However, our findings on impulsive choice are not likely to be attributed to motor deficits as the rats were not required to delay or inhibit responses, all 30 trials had to be completed and activation of either lever required the same motor response. Therefore the increased impulsive choice following infusion of DA receptor antagonists into the mPFC shown here likely reflects altered choice/decision making. The DA antagonists used in this study are selective for either DA D<sub>1</sub> or DA D<sub>2</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881112465497">Millan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112465497">Millan et al., 2001</xref>), yet SCH23390 also has agonist affinity at serotonin 5HT<sub>2</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112465497">Millan et al., 2001</xref>). Serotonin is known to play a role in impulsivity, however Loos and colleagues demonstrated that the effect of SCH23390 to increase impulsive choice in the mPFC was not affected by the co-administration of a serotonin 5HT<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112465497">Loos et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study was unable to determine whether the drug administration produced altered sensitivity to the increasing delay or the value of the reward. By analyzing the effect of treatment at different delay blocks, it appears that SCH23390 and high dose raclopride administration to the mPFC significantly inhibited delay responding in the earlier block 2. This may suggest that DA receptor antagonism alters the sensitivity to delay, which is mediated by the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112465497">Izaki et al., 2007</xref>) as it has previously been shown that mPFC infusions of SCH23390 does not impair the discrimination between larger and smaller rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269881112465497">St Onge et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, altered DA levels in the OFC influence how much value is attributed to a reward, and therefore whether that particular reward is worth the wait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112465497">Kheramin et al., 2004</xref>). Following administration into the OFC, higher dose raclopride was more effective in reducing delay responding at an earlier delay block than low dose raclopride, indicating that the choice for larger delays are more easily disrupted and may be due to altered value of the reward. Together with previous research, our findings contribute to the differentiation of DA function in each of these PFC subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112465497">Izaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112465497">Kheramin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269881112465497">St Onge et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the results of the current study, DA dysfunction within the PFC has been reported in disorders in which impulsivity is a feature. Impulsivity is an important feature of vulnerability to substance use and can contribute to relapse to drug-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112465497">Jentsch and Taylor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881112465497">Moeller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881112465497">Volkow and Fowler, 2000</xref>). A significant neurobiological mechanism underlying substance use and addiction is reduced DA function in the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881112465497">Koob and Volkow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269881112465497">Volkow et al., 2009</xref>). Deficits in PFC DA function have also been reported in schizophrenia and ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881112465497">Russell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881112465497">Volk and Lewis, 2010</xref>), disorders that are also characterized by impulsive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112465497">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112465497">Kaladjian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881112465497">Nolan et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The DA system is greatly involved in regulating responses to reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881112465497">Schultz, 1998</xref>) and has been proposed to be integral in ‘fine tuning’, or adjusting the ‘noise’ of the neural signal based on task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112465497">Arnsten, 2007</xref>). Low levels of D<sub>1</sub> stimulation would be optimal for a low level task, allowing for broad tuning, while in a more demanding high level cognitive task requiring narrow tuning, higher levels of D<sub>1</sub> receptor stimulation would be appropriate. This suggests that some PFC tasks may be more sensitive to alterations in DA levels than others. The DA receptor antagonist-induced impulsive choice in the current study is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112465497">Arnsten’s (2007)</xref> hypothesis of DA’s involvement in ‘fine tuning’ PFC neurons. Persistent high levels of tuning are integral for overcoming distractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881112465497">Miller et al., 1996</xref>) and inhibiting inappropriate behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112465497">Funahashi et al., 1993</xref>). The inhibition of DA receptors in the current study may have increased the ‘noise’ of the signal and therefore altered the rats’ responses to reinforcement.</p>
<p>The NE system is well described for mediating perception and interest in stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881112465497">Solanto, 1998</xref>). Consistent with the role of NE in the maintenance of interest, well trained rats performing a five-choice serial reaction time task show no marked increase in NE efflux in the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112465497">Dalley et al., 2001</xref>). The rats in the current study were very well trained by the time the drugs were administered. Therefore, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112465497">Dalley and colleagues (2001)</xref> findings, NE levels may not have been fluctuating as a result of task completion. This provides a possible explanation as to why stimulating NE receptors had no effect on task performance, since the task may have become independent of NE efflux. It is well described that impulsivity is not a unitary construct and can be divided into impulsive choice and impulsive action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269881112465497">Winstanley et al., 2006</xref>). While the results of this study suggest that NE efflux within regions of the PFC is not involved in impulsive choice, a recent study has shown that NE within the PFC is integral in modulation of impulsive action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112465497">Bari et al., 2011</xref>). Using a stop signal task, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112465497">Bari and colleagues (2011)</xref> found that local infusion of the NE transporter inhibitor, atomoxetine, into the OFC or dorsal prelimbic cortex reduced impulsive action. Furthermore, although local infusion of guanfacine into subregions of the PFC had no effect on impulsive choice in the current study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112465497">Bari and colleagues (2011)</xref> found that infusions of guanfacine into the dorsal prelimbic cortex increased impulsive action. While these disparate results highlight the dissociable role that NE plays within the construct of impulsivity, it is also important to note that subjects receiving noradrenergic treatments in the present study generally had a steep response curve to vehicle treatment across delay blocks which may have limited the sensitivity of the assay to changes in impulsive choice.</p>
<p>The role of DA and NE in impulsive choice, as measured by the DR task in the current study, is consistent with the different functions of these catecholamine systems within the brain. The significance of PFC DA in impulsive choice corresponds with the PFCs direct and indirect connections with the NAc and the role of DA in expectation of reward. DA in the PFC regulates glutamatergic efferents to the NAc as well as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which in turn has significant dopaminergic projections to the NAc. The NAc is integral for processing rewarding stimuli: however, the core but not the shell has been implicated in impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112465497">Cardinal et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881112465497">Pothuizen et al., 2005</xref>). The NAc shell has been shown to influence unlearned behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112465497">Kelley, 1999</xref>). This role of the NAc shell is consistent with findings that the NAc shell receives noradrenergic innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112465497">Berridge et al., 1997</xref>) and that well trained rats performing a task do not show NA efflux in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112465497">Dalley et al., 2001</xref>). Together this suggests that the dopaminergic NAc core is associated with impulsive choice, while the noradrenergic system has a less significant role.</p>
<p>Our study has shown that DA receptors play a distinct role in impulsive choice depending upon their location in the PFC. This is the first study to investigate the role of DA and NE receptors located in the OFC and mPFC in impulsive choice. The results highlight the importance of DA receptor function in impulsive choice and suggest future directions for treatments of disorders with impulsivity as a core feature. Future research would benefit from assessing impulsivity using multiple tasks, including those assessing impulsive action, to distinguish between the role of these neurotransmitters in the aversion to delay and sensitivity to reward.</p>
