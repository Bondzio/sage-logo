<p><italic>In the Days of Caesar: Pentecostalism and Political Theology</italic></p>
<p>Amos Yong</p>
<p>Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2010. 377 pp. $30.00</p>
<p>In this significant volume of the <italic>Sacra Doctrina’s Christian Theology for a Postmodern Age Series</italic>, Amos Yong (J. Rodman Williams Professor of Theology at Regent University) offers a compelling proposal towards developing a globally representative Pentecostal political theology. Moving beyond the boundaries of North American classical Pentecostalism, Yong builds his argument while utilizing insights from the socio-political practices and theological reflections of the global south—the location of over two-thirds of the contemporary Pentecostal movement.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the rich diversity and heterogeneity of the movement, the author introduces the provisional thesis that Pentecostalism “invites not one but many forms of political, economic, and social postures and practices” (37). He suggests that this distinctly Pentecostal polyphony of “many tongues, many political practices” (109) can make a viable contribution to the wider Christian discussion of political theology and aid the ecumenical Church’s engagement at the pluralistic space of the global public square.</p>
<p>The volume is organized in two parts. Part I lays down the conceptual groundwork of the text, starting with an overview of the diverse theologies and practices of Pentecostal Christianity, while correcting prevailing theological and political stereotypes of Pentecostalism. The text unveils the plurality of Pentecostalisms among which we discover some unique paradigms of alternative socio-economic patterns, advocating a progressivist stand towards society, politics, and culture. Chapter 2 provides a survey of the field of political theology by reviewing its biblical foundations and highlighting the fundamental voices of the discipline, starting with the patristic period and concluding with the most influential contemporary contributors. Chapter 3 concludes the section by sketching the thesis that the polyglotism of Pentecostal politics and the multiplicity of political theologies can converge in a productive, mutually beneficial dialogue.</p>
<p>Facilitating such a dialogue while constructing a globally applicable Pentecostal political theology becomes the task of Part II, where Yong utilizes the distinctly Pentecostal theological pattern of “the Five-fold Gospel” (the confession of Christ as a Savior, Sanctifier, Baptizer with the Holy Spirit, Healer, and Returning King) as the fundamental template for his theological undertaking. The christocentricity of this landmark of Pentecostal spirituality provides the framework of the next five chapters. Each chapter begins with an interface of one of the five christological themes with Pentecostalism and politics, continues by engaging various non-Pentecostal traditions, and concludes by proposing an ecumenically appealing set of Christian socio-political practices and beliefs.</p>
<p>The author selects a broad range of prominent dialogical partners whose voices continue to dominate the arena of contemporary political theology. In chapter 4, Yong suggests that Abraham Kuyper’s social ontology can provide a framework for understanding “the biblical language of powers related to the public realm” (162) in articulating a gospel of comprehensive socio-political redemption. In chapter 5, John Howard Yoder’s political ecclesiology, Stanley Hauerwas’s community of resident aliens, and prominent thinkers of the New Monasticism movement are engaged in a dialogue towards developing “a sanctified politics and theology of culture” (166). Chapter 6 invites the post-secular theology of Radical Orthodoxy into a constructive conversation towards proposing a “politico-prophetic theology of mission and socio-cultural evangelization” (211). In chapter 7, the Roman Catholic Church’s tradition of social teaching informs a viable Pentecostal theology of economics of healing and shalom. Finally, chapter 8 brings Jewish political theology, liberation theology, and political theology of the environment into a conversation with progressive Pentecostal perspectives, shaping a hopeful political theology of history and the eschaton.</p>
<p>With erudition and finesse, Yong undertakes the monumental task of surveying the complex terrain of global Pentecostal political practices and often informal theological reflections, weaving a net of meaning and cohesion that celebrates the beauty of Pentecostal diversity while anchoring its constructive and creative argument into unifying distinctives of Pentecostal spirituality. Starting with the Pentecostal kaleidoscope of perspectives, the text evolves into a skillfully structured ecumenical dialogue, which (in continuity with the Pentecostal openness to the language of the other) shapes the many tongues of political theology into an imaginative and inspiring proposal for Christian socio-political praxis in the global village.</p>
<p>The method of the argument accommodates a broad audience. On the one hand, the straightforward and clear articulation of the project provides non-Pentecostal readers with the necessary tools to navigate through the unfamiliarity of the overwhelming Pentecostal polyphony through the dialogical lenses of other traditions. On the other hand, the plurality of non-Pentecostal political theologies and voices that Yong invites into the conversation deconstructs the boundaries of sectarian isolationism that has often kept Pentecostal theology in exile beyond the picket fences of the academy. The outcome is a viable Pentecostal theology of global cosmopolitan civil society and economics that seeks the welfare of all of its citizens in a hopeful recasting of its eschatological destiny. We cannot overstate the importance of this vision. While some may object that Yong’s methodology is overreaching in accommodation of premature optimism, others will look at its constructive hope as a welcome gift of Pentecostal hospitality—the hospitality of a movement that has made the entire globe its home.</p>
