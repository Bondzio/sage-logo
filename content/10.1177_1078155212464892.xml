<abstract>
<sec><title>Purpose:</title>
<p>There is no consensus in the oncology community about the optimal model for anticoagulation management of ambulatory cancer patients. To understand oncologists’ preferences regarding anticoagulation management, we compared the characteristics of patients referred to an oncology-oriented anticoagulation management service with “usual care” patients managed by the patient’s primary oncologist.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Methods:</title>
<p>We performed a retrospective medical record review of ambulatory oncology patients’ anticoagulation care at a comprehensive cancer center. We examined the characteristics of 33 patients anticoagulated before implementation of a dedicated oncology anticoagulation management service. We compared this group with 33 patients managed by the anticoagulation management service and with 39 usual care patients managed by the primary oncologist after the anticoagulation management service was created. We also examined differences in laboratory test utilization, time in the therapeutic range (for patients anticoagulated with warfarin), and anticoagulation-related adverse events during a 3-month assessment period.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Results:</title>
<p>Anticoagulation management service patients were more likely to be treated for hematologic malignancies, use erythropoietin stimulating agents, and require warfarin management for previous venous thromboembolic disease compared to usual care patients. In contrast, oncologists were more likely to manage anticoagulation care of patients with advanced solid tumors undergoing active chemotherapy. Anticoagulation management service and usual care patients on warfarin therapy had comparable time in the therapeutic range and complication rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Oncologists selectively referred patients to the anticoagulation management service. Anticoagulation management service patients’ warfarin control and complication rates were comparable to care provided by the primary oncologist, suggesting that an oncology-specific anticoagulation management service may be a feasible and effective option for anticoagulation management of ambulatory oncology patients.</p>

<body>
<p>Anticoagulation management in oncology poses several challenges that are not present in the general medical population including a higher risk of bleeding (due to qualitative and quantitative platelet deficiencies) and thrombosis (due to disease-related thrombophilia).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212464892">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212464892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212464892"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212464892">4</xref></sup> Many chemotherapies result in bone marrow suppression, with resulting anemia and thrombocytopenia. Others antagonize blood vessel proliferation or promote vessel fragility (due to radiation therapy), directly increasing the risk of bleeding and thrombosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212464892">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212464892">6</xref></sup> Underlying disease processes, including tumor invasion and metastases of vital structures, can increase patients’ vulnerability to catastrophic bleeding events. These challenges are dynamic, evolving quickly with disease progression and treatment.</p>
<p>Given these challenges, the anticoagulation care of ambulatory oncology patients necessitates careful monitoring and clinical judgment. Anticoagulation management of cancer patients requires the clinician to select the appropriate indication, assess the level of risk, choose the optimal anticoagulant (warfarin, low molecular weight heparin, or newer agents), and define the duration of therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212464892">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212464892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212464892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212464892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212464892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212464892"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212464892">13</xref></sup> Several compelling studies demonstrated the superiority of low-molecular-weight heparin for outpatient secondary prophylaxis of venous thrombosis in cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212464892">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212464892">15</xref></sup> But this is an evolving area of practice. Recent studies have shown the safety and efficacy of direct thrombin inhibitors and Factor Xa antagonists for prophylaxis and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and atrial fibrillation, but the applicability of these findings to oncology care is unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212464892">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212464892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212464892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155212464892"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155212464892">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some clinicians favor warfarin as a low-cost, first-line therapy in low-risk cancer patients treated for non-cancer indications, such as atrial fibrillation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078155212464892">21</xref></sup> Although there is substantial evidence from primary care and ambulatory cardiology programs that centralized warfarin management is less expensive than standard care of patients with deep vein thrombosis and atrial fibrillation, produces tighter therapeutic control, and results in fewer adverse events, few cancer centers offer centralized anticoagulation management services (AMSs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155212464892">22</xref></sup> This may reflect oncology practitioners’ inclination to customize and manage their own patients’ anticoagulation care.</p>
<p>To understand oncologists’ preferences and judgments regarding anticoagulation management, we set out to study referral decisions of oncologists at our cancer center after the implementation of an oncology-oriented AMS. Specifically, we sought to understand the characteristics of patients whom clinicians referred to the service compared to patients whom they managed themselves. A secondary aim was to assess the quality of anticoagulation management and the type and rate of care-related complications.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1078155212464892" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec2-1078155212464892"><title>Setting</title>
<p>We studied patients treated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), a Boston-based comprehensive cancer centre serving 299,202 adult and pediatric ambulatory care patients in 2009. DFCI clinical care is organized into disease-specific programs that work in interdisciplinary teams. Clinicians use electronic order-entry systems to prescribe chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy medications. Two-thirds of Dana-Farber patients were women. Eighty-five percent self-identified as white, 3.7% black, 2.5% Hispanic, and 1.8% Asian. Nineteen percent of patients were at least age 70.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1078155212464892"><title>Intervention</title>
<p>Dana-Farber created an AMS in November 2007 in order to reduce the risk of adverse drug events related to anticoagulants. The service grew from a small, existing program in which a nurse practitioner and hematologist managed patients with coagulopathies. This group accepted occasional anticoagulation management referrals from local oncologists, but there was no formal service.</p>
<p>The new service accepted referrals from all DFCI staff oncologists. It consisted of a part-time hematologist medical director, 1.0 FTE nurse practitioners, and 0.5 FTE administrative support. The service accepted patients with newly diagnosed anticoagulation management needs as well as those who were already receiving anticoagulation care by DFCI oncologists. Management consisted of an intake assessment, educational outreach, laboratory monitoring at the hospital or via labs collected at local facilities and faxed to the AMS. Onsite phlebotomy was available and samples were run on a STAR Evolution (Diagnostica Stago, Asnières sur Seine, France) device. Laboratory turnaround times averaged about 95 minutes from specimen receipt to report, which was generally sufficient to allow management during the course of patients’ office and infusion appointments. Patients also used offsite labs when INR testing was required that did not coincide with scheduled cancer care appointments. Results from outside labs were faxed to the DFCI AMS staff. Point-of-service testing was considered initially but was eventually judged not to be economical. Although we had anticipated an initial in-person nurse practitioner or physician consultation, this occurred infrequently for routine care of patients with thromboembolic disease. Most (about 90%) of the counseling and anticoagulation management was performed by a nurse and was not charged or reimbursed. The service used a commercial software program (Standing Stone, Westport, CT) for tracking test results, doses, and dose adjustments, with prompts for overdue laboratory tests. AMS actions were available to DFCI providers directly in the electronic medical record. AMS providers advertised their service through email messages, plasma screen displays in well-trafficked areas, and visits to meetings of various clinical groups.</p>
<p>The service grew rapidly after its inception, from 30 patients in late 2007 to 76 patients in early 2009. By late 2010, the program served 114 active warfarin patients and had a total caseload of 259. Contrary to expectation, most of the program growth was of patients with newly diagnosed thrombotic events in cancer patients, with or without known thrombophilia, rather than transition of long-term anticoagulation patients from existing providers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1078155212464892"><title>Evaluation design</title>
<p>We conducted a retrospective evaluation to examine the characteristics of anticoagulation patients and their care during the baseline period (from 1 January 2007 through 31 October 2007, before implementation of the AMS) with those in the year after AMS implementation (from 1 November 2007 through 31 December 2008). We also compared the characteristics of patients who were managed by the AMS service with a group of cancer patients who received anticoagulation management from their usual oncology provider during the period when the AMS was available (from 1 November 2007 through 31 December 2008).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1078155212464892" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title>
<p>We identified subjects as follows. We selected all 430 adult ambulatory patients who received at least two prescriptions written by a DFCI provider in the electronic medical record from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2008 for any of the following medications: warfarin, heparin, enoxaparin, dalteparin, and fondaparinux. These drugs were the most commonly ordered anticoagulants at the cancer center.</p>
<p>We selected 50 (26%) patients at random from among 194 who received prescriptions from 1 January 2007 to 31 October 2007 (baseline group); 1 of the 50 patients selected was later found to be ineligible and was excluded from the analyses. Of the patients who received at least two prescriptions by a DFCI provider from 1 November 2007 to 31 December 2008, 50 patients (66%) were selected at random from the 76 who received AMS and another 50 (31%) were selected at random from the remaining 160 non-AMS patients (concurrent usual care).</p>
<p>We found that about one third of AMS patients had non-malignant hematologic disorders. These thrombophilic patients represent a high-risk sub-population that was managed historically by hematologists who later led the new AMS program. To focus on cancer-related anticoagulation services, we excluded patients with non-malignant hematologic diagnoses from the analyses. In all, 14 patients from the baseline group, 7 patients from the usual care group, and none of the AMS patients experienced a hospitalization during the study period. We included patients with hospital admissions but excluded laboratory tests obtained during the hospitalization since these admissions were unrelated to anticoagulation management. None of the hospitalizations was due to thrombosis, bleeding, or other complications of anticoagulation management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1078155212464892"><title>Measures</title>
<p>We developed a chart abstraction instrument based on drug utilization review tools used previously by the DFCI pharmacy department for routine assessment of medication use and safety. The instrument was updated for the purpose of this evaluation, informed by a review of the literature and input from staff hematology consultants.</p>
<p>We abstracted patient characteristics including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and insurance type. Clinical variables included height and weight, cancer diagnosis and stage, number of medications, and the use of concurrent chemotherapy. We noted the type of anticoagulant, duration of therapy, and the usual anticoagulation provider. The indication for therapy was recorded (treatment vs. prophylaxis) and concurrent medications that increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis (e.g., thalidomide, lenalidomide, bevacizumab, etc.). We also recorded the dates of laboratory tests used for anticoagulation monitoring during the 3-month chart review period: international normalized ratio (INR), serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and platelet count. We abstracted information about complications including venous thromboses and bleeding episodes. We defined a major bleed as one that resulted in a drop in the hemoglobin by at least 1 gram/dL or that required hospitalization or transfusion.</p>
<p>Advanced pharmacy students, trained and supervised by a member of the evaluation team, performed electronic chart reviews. They examined progress notes, medication and allergy lists, laboratory test values, and radiology reports for a 3-month evaluation period. For patients managed before the anticoagulation service began (baseline group), the study period extended 3 months from the date of the first anticoagulant prescription written after 1 January 2007. For patients managed after the anticoagulation service was established, the evaluation period extended 3 months from the date of the first anticoagulant prescription written after 1 November 2007. Chart abstraction information was recorded on paper forms that were then entered into a secure electronic database for analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1078155212464892"><title>Analyses</title>
<p>We tabulated patient characteristics, stratified by care group. We then calculated the mean number of anticoagulation-related laboratory tests (hemoglobin, platelet count, serum creatinine, and INR) performed per patient. The percent of time in the therapeutic range (TTR) was calculated for those on warfarin therapy using the Rosendaal method, along with the mean percent of days within the therapeutic range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078155212464892">23</xref></sup> INR values in the first 30 days of warfarin therapy were excluded from TTR calculations, following common practice, due to labile values during the initiation of therapy. The presence and types of complications was tabulated as well. We calculated <italic>t</italic>-tests to examine differences between groups.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1078155212464892" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient characteristics</title>
<p>Patients in the baseline, AMS, and post-AMS usual care groups were similar in terms of age, race, ethnicity, and body mass index (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155212464892">Table 1</xref>). A smaller percent of men received usual compared to AMS care. A greater proportion of AMS patients had private insurance. The cancer diagnoses were similar, except that patients with hematologic malignancies were over-represented among those in the AMS, while solid-tumor patients and those with metastatic disease were over-represented in the usual care group. AMS patients were also more likely to have received warfarin, to be treated for prophylaxis, and to have had prior thromboembolic events.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078155212464892">Table 2</xref> displays the number and type of laboratory tests used to monitor anticoagulation care among the three groups. Among the three laboratory parameters hemoglobin, platelet count, and serum creatinine, AMS patients had less than half as many parameters measured compared to patients at baseline and those in the usual care group. This likely reflects the greater number of active-treatment patients in those groups. However, AMS patients had substantially more INR tests performed compared to the other groups (controlling for the number of warfarin recipients). AMS patients had more days with the INR in the therapeutic range (56.5% AMS vs. 46.1% usual care), although this difference was not statistically significant. The number and rate of treatment-related complications, however, was higher among AMS and usual care groups compared to patients at baseline, although the differences were not statistically significant.

<p>In this retrospective evaluation of anticoagulation care of ambulatory oncology patients at a cancer center, clinicians referred a subset of their patients to the AMS. AMS patients were often being treated for hematologic malignancies, used erythropoietin stimulating agents, and required warfarin management for previous venous thromboembolic disease. In contrast, oncologists were more likely to manage on their own the anticoagulation care of patients with advanced solid tumors undergoing active chemotherapy. Oncologists were also more likely to manage on their own non-warfarin anticoagulants and those on limited-duration therapy. In sum, oncologists seemed more likely to use the AMS to avoid the complexity and effort of long-term management of warfarin among patients with a history of thrombophilia and who were generally not receiving concurrent chemotherapy.</p>
<p>AMS care resulted in more time in the therapeutic range (56.5%) compared to the usual care group (46.1%), although the difference was not statistically significant. A sample of over 400 patients in each group would be needed to demonstrate a 10% absolute difference in this measure, assuming 80% power, a two-tailed test, and alpha = 0.5. However, these rates are similar to those reported in clinical trials comparing warfarin with low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulation in cancer patients and in an assessment of anticoagulation management of cancer patients within community-based anticoagulation programs. TTR values from 41% to 54% have been reported in oncology patients, with most centers reporting TTR of approximately 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212464892">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212464892">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078155212464892">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078155212464892">25</xref></sup> The results of a prospective case comparison study of community-based warfarin management services revealed that the subset of patients with cancer had a TTR of 54% compared with non-cancer control patients (66%) despite management by the same clinical AMS staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078155212464892">25</xref></sup> These findings highlight the difficulty of managing warfarin in cancer patients. Chemotherapy, antibiotic use, and variable diet during chemotherapy treatment are believed to contribute to the greater variability in INR values in this population.</p>
<p>The complication rates were similar in the AMS and usual care groups and higher than during the baseline period – a non-significant difference. The change from baseline may be an artifact of the small number of complications. It may also reflect a general increase in the use of thrombosis-prone therapies. Of 46 patients in the baseline group, 26 (57%) received at least one thrombosis-related medication, compared to 36/46 (78%) of usual care and 23/33 (70%) of AMS patients. Our complication rates are similar to rates of bleeding (8% minor, 2% major) and thrombosis (3%) among anticoagulation clinic patients reported in a general medical population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078155212464892">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>These results offer a reassuring picture of centralized anticoagulation management in ambulatory oncology. An AMS can safely and effectively manage the anticoagulation care of a subset of oncology patients without the intimate, daily involvement of the primary oncologist. This resource frees the oncologist’s time for other professional activities. Oncology patients require more intensive warfarin monitoring than non-cancer patients, particularly during concurrent surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy treatment. As a result, the patient caseload per oncology AMS provider is about 100 active cases per practitioner, at the lower end of the ratio of 100–300 patients per practitioner in other Boston AMS programs serving non-oncology patients. Over time, we hope that the expense of approximately $1000 per patient per year will be offset by a reduction in the number of anticoagulation-related adverse events and admissions, and by enhanced productivity of the referring oncologist. Previous studies in non-oncology settings have demonstrated per-patient savings of up to $1600 per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078155212464892">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078155212464892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078155212464892"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078155212464892">29</xref></sup> However, these savings typically accrue to third-party payers rather than to the healthcare organizations that sponsor the service. Since much anticoagulation management care is provided by telephone to patients in the community, few of these encounters are reimbursable.</p>
<p>This project’s limitations include its small sample, which affects the statistical power to identify small differences across groups. The program was created at a single cancer center, which limits the generalizability of the experience to other similar settings. It is possible that oncologists with less experience, expertise, or confidence managing anticoagulation preferentially refer patients to the AMS compared to other practitioners. This would tend to diminish the magnitude of any observed benefit from AMS, as the most skilled oncologists (with respect to anticoagulation management) would comprise the usual care group. Similarly, if providers refer the most challenging and difficult-to-control cases to AMS, this would also bias results toward the null. In both cases, the magnitude of the difference between AMS and usual care groups would tend to underestimate the true effect. However, we believe that the observed referral pattern was more likely based on clinic proximity and familiarity with AMS providers. Finally, the program evaluation reported here is not a controlled trial that randomized patients or providers into intervention and control groups. It is a retrospective attempt to capture the early experience of a new clinical service, so that others might learn from this evolving area of practice.</p>
<p>In conclusion, an AMS for oncology patients is a feasible and effective model for ensuring the safe use of anticoagulants in a set of cancer patients. Oncologists use the program selectively for long-term warfarin management of complex patients, while continuing to manage many active-treatment patients themselves. Additional experience and clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the generalizability of this approach, to better understand its clinical benefit and cost effectiveness, and to examine clinicians’ preferences and assessments of the value of the service.</p>
