<sec>
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>To examine whether a diverse range of both structured and unstructured routine activities is associated with offending, and whether activities have crime-specific effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Data on 15-year-olds from the fourth wave of the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime were analyzed (minimum <italic>n</italic> = 3,064). Principal components analyses identified core routine activities. Random intercepts logistic regression models examined their associations with assault, fare evasion, shoplifting, vandalism, and drug use.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Core routine activities identified were hanging around with friends locally, hanging around away from home, nightlife, cultural and consumer activities, and involvement in youth clubs and sports. All had associations with offending, though effects varied by offense. For example, involvement in youth clubs and sports was positively associated with assault and fare evasion; involvement in nightlife was positively associated with assault and drug use; and hanging out with friends locally was positively associated with assault, shoplifting, and vandalism.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>It is theorized that the varied targets and facilitators present in different activity settings help account for study results. Findings are limited by the cross-sectional character of data analyzed and may be influenced by selection effects. They would benefit from further testing with longitudinal data.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent decades, theories that focus on situations and opportunities as causes of crime have edged toward the mainstream of criminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811432641">Birkbeck and LaFree 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427811432641">Brantingham and Brantingham 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811432641">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811432641">Clarke 2009</xref>, 1997, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427811432641">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811432641">Cohen and Felson 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811432641">Cornish and Clarke 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811432641">Cullen 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811432641">Horney 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022427811432641">Wortley and Mazerolle 2008</xref>). These theories see crime as rooted in the daily activities of actors, their intersection with one another, and their interactions with the social and physical structures around them. Together, these elements create opportunities for crime and, in turn, patterns of crime that are distributed unevenly through space and time. Under the banner of “environmental criminology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427811432641">Brantingham and Brantingham 1981</xref>), these theoretical developments have spawned an impressive body of scholarship. However, its focus on criminal events distances environmental criminology from the traditional criminological enterprise of explaining individuals' offending with reference to their characteristics or social and economic circumstances (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427811432641">Agnew 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811432641">Cloward and Ohlin 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811432641">Cohen 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811432641">Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427811432641">Hirschi 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022427811432641">Merton 1938</xref>). As well as drawing on quite different independent variables, the two approaches also have different dependent variables—one concerned with <italic>crime</italic>, the other with <italic>criminality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427811432641">Eck 1995</xref>). Efforts to unite these perspectives have been limited and remain an important challenge for criminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811432641">Cullen 2011</xref>). The ideas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Osgood et al. (1996)</xref> present one of the most significant attempts to bridge the divide, using concepts from environmental criminology to help explain individual offending (though see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022427811432641">Wikström et al. 2010</xref>). Adapting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811432641">Cohen and Felson’s (1979)</xref> routine activity theory, they theorize—and empirically demonstrate—that rates of individual offending can be explained in part by the amount of time they spend engaged in unstructured socializing with peers in the absence of authority figures.</p>
<p>The current article builds on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Osgood et al.’s (1996)</xref> ideas, but argues that further insights from environmental criminology, not considered by Osgood and colleagues, help provide a more adequate explanation of the impacts of routine activities on individual offending. Not only is it argued that activities other than those highlighted by Osgood and colleagues may increase offending, but that there are important variations in the types of crime supported by different activities. This is because the specific settings in which activities take place vary in the quantity and type of crime targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811432641">Cohen and Felson 1979</xref>) and the facilitators or precipitators of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811432641">Clarke 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811432641">Clarke and Eck 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427811432641">Wortley 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022427811432641">2008</xref>). This takes us beyond a theory concerned with a single type of routine activity as an independent variable, or general classes of offending behavior as dependent variables.</p>

<title>The Routine Activity Theory of General Deviance (RATGD)</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811432641">Cohen and Felson’s (1979)</xref> “routine activity theory” provides a key foundation to the environmental perspective: direct-contact, predatory crime occurs when a motivated offender meets a suitable target in the absence of a capable guardian. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811432641">Felson (1995)</xref> has, since, extended the concept of guardianship to include also “handlers”—the supervisors of a potential offender (e.g., parents or school principals) and “place managers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427811432641">Eck 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811432641">Felson 1995</xref>) who control or monitor a specific location (e.g., landlords, bus drivers or restaurant owners). The patterns of daily life, and the “routine activities” they involve, affect the chances of these factors converging in space and time to produce crime.</p>
<p>Cohen and Felson’s theory has been used to explain variations in group patterns of victimization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427811432641">Jensen and Brownfield 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427811432641">Maxfield 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022427811432641">Sampson and Wooldredge 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022427811432641">Tseloni et al. 2004</xref>) and crime rates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427811432641">Bennett 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022427811432641">Messner and Blau 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Roncek and Maier 1991</xref>) but far less individual offending. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Osgood et al. (1996)</xref> were among the first to do so, offering a “routine activity theory of general deviance” (p. 636; referred to hereafter as RATGD). Their theory is concerned with a broader range of deviance than the direct contact predatory crime addressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811432641">Cohen and Felson (1979)</xref>, and considers all “situations in which a deviant act is possible or rewarding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Osgood et al. 1996</xref>:649). They argue that unstructured socializing with peers in the absence of authority figures represents the principal routine activity associated with general deviance: friends may supply drugs, provide support in a fight, or act as a ready look-out, while directly rewarding deviance; the absence of an authority figure willing to respond delinquent behaviors makes deviance more likely; and, unstructured activities involve fewer actors responsible for social control (such as athletics coaches or cinema ushers) while providing more time available for deviance. They test their theory on five waves of longitudinal self-report data for 18–26-year-olds and mostly find that general criminal behavior, measures of drug and alcohol use, and dangerous driving associate with riding around in a car for fun, getting together with friends informally, going to parties, and spending evenings out for fun and recreation. The latter also accounted for a substantial part of the variation in deviance associated with age, sex, high school grades, and parents' education.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427811432641">Osgood and Anderson (2004)</xref> have since extended Osgood et al.’s (1996) analysis by showing associations between both individual- and group-level measures of unstructured, unsupervised socializing with individual rates of delinquency. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811432641">Anderson and Hughes (2009)</xref> have also shown effects of indirect measures of unstructured, unsupervised socializing—income and access to private transportation—on property and violent crime. The theory has also been tested in the context of other theoretical models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811432641">Bernburg and Thorlindsson (2001)</xref> examine Osgood and colleagues' deviance predictors after controlling for social bond and differential association variables on an Icelandic cross-sectional survey of youth. Effects of routine activities on property and violent offending are reduced, but remain, after controls are introduced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811432641">Hay and Forrest (2008)</xref> use cross-sectional data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth to test effects of unsupervised socializing alongside self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811432641">Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990</xref>). They find it is a greater predictor of general offending for those with lower self-control. Meanwhile, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427811432641">Maimon and Browning (2010)</xref> use data from Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods to integrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Osgood et al.’s (1996)</xref> theory with theories of social disorganization. Unstructured socializing with peers in the absence of authority figures was a powerful predictor of violence, with neighborhood collective efficacy increasing these activities, but attenuating their impact on violence.</p>

<sec id="section4-0022427811432641">
<title>The Influence of Activity Settings on Offending</title>
<p>According to the evidence, RATGD shows consistent predictive effects on offending, even when tested alongside other, potentially competing, theories. However, this article argues that the theory can be extended by drawing on principles of environmental criminology not fully addressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Osgood et al. (1996)</xref>. In making this argument, two observations are of note.</p>
<p>First, an individual’s activities, regardless of whether unstructured, with friends, or absent authority figures, are carried out in a variety of physical and social settings. These activity settings will vary in important ways, with implications for the levels of criminality they support. They will vary according to the concentration of suitable targets present—namely, the victims or objects that are the focus of criminal acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811432641">Cohen and Felson 1979</xref>). Additionally, factors that make particular types of offending easier will sometimes be present, other times not. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811432641">Clarke and Eck (2005</xref>:66) describe crime facilitators as situational characteristics that “help offenders commit crimes or acts of disorder.” Facilitators may influence the risks, efforts, rewards, provocations, or excuses associated with crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811432641">Clarke 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811432641">Clarke and Eck 2005</xref>). They include “physical facilitators,” that include tools or aspects of the physical environment that enhance an offender’s capabilities or serve to overcome prevention measures; “social facilitators,” that increase rewards from crime, or provide encouragement and legitimation; and “chemical facilitators” that increase the ability of offenders to ignore risks or moral constraints. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427811432641">Wortley (2008)</xref> has also described “situational precipitators,” including “prompts” that trigger criminal behavior by surfacing criminally motivating thoughts, feelings or desires, social “pressures” that promote inappropriate behavior, “permissions” that permit normally forbidden behavior, or “provocations” that create stress and provoke antisocial—often aggressive—responses. Wortley’s precipitators are largely subsumed within the categories of facilitators described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811432641">Clarke and Eck (2005)</xref>.</p>
<p>Second, different settings, because they encompass different situational factors, will tend to support different types of offending. It is only possible to carry out a particular predatory crime (burglary, robbery, car theft, etc.) when a suitable target for the crime is present (a house, a person, a car, etc.). The rational choice perspective and situational crime prevention approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811432641">Clarke 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811432641">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811432641">Cornish and Clarke 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811432641">2008</xref>) tell us that: “the factors weighed by offenders, and the variables influencing their decision-making, will…differ greatly with the nature of the offence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427811432641">Cornish and Clarke 2008</xref>:26). For example, they may differ with respect to the ease of the crime, the perceived risks, and the potential rewards. They will vary also according to facilitators present in a setting. For example, the presence of alcohol may be a facilitator for violence, but is unlikely to promote identity theft. Similarly, the social dynamics of a sports event, with rowdy supporters from opposite teams in close proximity, may provide encouragement and legitimation for violence between fans, but likely does little to augment local burglary rates.</p>
<p>The crime-specific character of settings is supported by empirical evidence. For example, individual hotspots show a notable degree of crime specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022427811432641">Weisburd, Maher, and Sherman 1992</xref>). Studies of youth delinquency show that patterns of variation through the day, or between school days and nonschool days (and by implication settings), are very different according to the offense type considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811432641">Gottfredson and Soulé 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427811432641">Jacob and Lefgren 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0022427811432641">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>Premised on the theoretical arguments presented, this article tests whether different routine activities are associated with different types of offending, according to the activity settings they involve. It is suggested that a range of activities, beyond unstructured socializing with peers in the absence of authority figures, may be predictive of offending. Two core hypotheses are proposed, with additional more specific hypotheses developed later in the article:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> A diverse range of routine activities are associated with offending. Effects are not conditional upon unstructured socializing with peers in the absence of authority figures.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2:</italic> Different routine activities are associated with different types of crime.</p>

<title>Research Design and Data</title>
<p>The study uses data collected by the longitudinal Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime (ESYTC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022427811432641">McVie 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022427811432641">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022427811432641">Smith 2004</xref>). The study tracks an entire cohort of over 4,000 young people who, in 1998, entered secondary school (aged 11) in Scotland’s capital city, home to nearly half a million residents from a diverse range of socioeconomic backgrounds. All 23 of Edinburgh’s public schools agreed to participate, along with eight out of 14 private and nine out of 12 special needs schools, providing 92 percent coverage of the city’s eligible children.</p>
<p>This article uses data primarily from self-report questionnaires administered in wave 4 of the ESYTC, administered when respondents were mostly 15 years old. Select variables are also used from wave 3, a year earlier. Analysis focuses on up to 3,454 (of 4,144) wave 4 participants who had provided residential information in wave 1, allowing statistical adjustment for clustering across 91 distinct neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022427811432641">McVie 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427811432641">Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls 1997</xref>). There were mostly small or negligible differences between included and excluded wave 4 participants across a range of measures, producing no meaningful differences between the full wave 4 sample and the subset analyzed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022427811432641">1</xref></sup> Descriptive statistics for research subjects are provided below in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427811432641">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811432641">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427811432641">3</xref>.</p>

<p>Multiple questionnaire items on routine activities are explored using principal components analysis to identify core activities. Drawing on literature and theory, further specific hypotheses relating activity variables to offending are then developed. Multivariate models then examine relationships between routine activity variables and five different offenses: assault, shoplifting, fare evasion, vandalism, and using drugs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while the ESYTC collects longitudinal data, considerable year-on-year variation in routine activity questions prevented a longitudinal analysis. The predominantly cross-sectional design therefore used involves ambiguities about causal order. For example, associations between particular activities and types of offending could reflect a pattern of self-selection, in which a youth motivated to carry out a particular offense is also more likely to participate in certain activities. These problems are endemic to most studies carried on the topic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811432641">Anderson and Hughes 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811432641">Bernburg and Thorlindsson 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811432641">Hay and Forrest 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427811432641">Osgood and Anderson 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, the ESYTC's focus on 15-year-olds probably means offending patterns tend to be more contingent on everyday activities than would be found among older respondents, for whom offending may often be more deliberate with growing experience (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427811432641">Brantingham and Brantinghan 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811432641">Cornish and Clarke 1986</xref>). More importantly, the study uses an extensive list of control variables that reduce the risk of spurious statistical findings. Control variables not only tap into major alternative theoretical explanations of delinquency, they also include measures of self-report offending from the prior year (wave 3) to capture aspects of underlying criminal propensity not captured by the theory-based measures.</p>

<title>Analyzing and Theorizing Routine Activities of Edinburgh Youth</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427811432641">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive statistics for all measured routine activities conducted away from home, school, or work. While diverse, many seem to overlap in meaning (e.g., going out with friends and hanging around), while others apparently describe similar activities and settings (e.g., going to pubs and going to discos or clubs). Activities related to seeing friends, hanging around parts of Edinburgh, going out shopping or eating, or attending sports centers, youth clubs or other groups, were generally more common than nightlife items, such as visits to pubs and discos or clubs, even though the latter were surprisingly common.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022427811432641">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>To identify core routine activity dimensions, principal components analysis was conducted. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427811432641">Table 1</xref> reports the factor loadings of the analysis. These represent the standardized multivariate regression coefficients produced when factors are regressed against questionnaire items.</p>
<p>The table indicates a five factor solution based both on a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022427811432641">Kaiser (1960)</xref> criterion (five factors had eigenvalues of 1.0 or more) and a scree plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811432641">Cattell 1966</xref>). Together, prerotated factors accounted for 54 percent of variance. Factors were rotated using a direct oblimin method, plausibly allowing their correlations between factors. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was .71 and the Bartlett's test of sphericity <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, indicating the data were suitable for principal components analysis. The meanings of routine activity factors are discussed below.</p>
<sec id="section8-0022427811432641">
<title>Hanging Around (Factors 1 and 2)</title>
<p>Items concerned with “hanging around” load onto the first two factors. Factor 2 best approximates RATGD’s unstructured, socializing in the absence of authority figures, although not all theoretical elements are explicit among high loading items (&gt;.4) which include: going to friends' houses, going out with friends, and hanging out where the respondent lives. Factor 1, though somewhat harder to interpret, also resembles the RATGD concept, with high loadings on time spent hanging around in other areas of Edinburgh, Edinburgh city center, and outside of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>It is hypothesized that these activities—factor 2 in particular—associate with a range of crime activities, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Osgood et al.’s (1996)</xref> emphasis on general deviancy. They will likely include crimes with targets in and around street settings, where these activities probably often take place. They would include most delinquency variables analyzed here, with the partial exception of fare evasion: travel would not be necessary for those hanging around locally.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022427811432641">
<title>Nightlife (Factor 3)</title>
<p>The third factor describes youth going to “pubs” and “discos, nightclubs, or raves” based on factors with higher loadings, though it also has a modest loading for going to “music concerts or gigs”. Involvement in nightlife does not fit neatly within RATGD. It is a social activity, though not really unstructured, and takes place in settings with authority figures, such as bar and door staff. The activity was not included in either <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Osgood et al.’s (1996)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427811432641">Osgood and Anderson’s (2004)</xref> analyses.</p>
<p>Yet, for theoretical and empirical reasons, it is hypothesized that these activities are associated with offending, specifically assault and drug use. Research shows a consistent association between bars (and clubs) and crime—notably violent crime—within and near premises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427811432641">Homel and Clarke 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022427811432641">Roman et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Roncek and Maier 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811432641">Scott and Dedel 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022427811432641">Sherman 1995</xref>). Recently, Wikstrom et al. (2010) also showed that time spent by youth in areas with concentrations of bars and nightclubs was associated with elevated rates of general delinquency. Though many factors may explain these associations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427811432641">Wortley (2008)</xref> describes how violence in a nightclub can be triggered by a range of precipitators, including unfriendly staff, crowding, alcohol consumption, or peer-group pressure. In the United Kingdom, clubs are also strongly associated with recreational drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427811432641">Deehan and Saville 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427811432641">Measham, Aldridge, and Parker 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022427811432641">O’Hagan 1999</xref>) with recreational drugs a central feature of the dance scene.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022427811432641">
<title>Cultural and Consumer Activity (Factor 4)</title>
<p>Time spent going to the “cinema or theater,” going “shopping or out for something to eat,” and, to a lesser extent, going to “music concerts or gigs,” are items with high loadings on factor 4. These activities primarily involve cultural events and economic consumption. They are examples of structured activities, in which authority figures will tend to be present (such as ushers, waiters, door staff, or shop keepers) that RATGD would not associate with offending.</p>
<p>Settings of cultural and consumer activity do not have obvious crime facilitators such as alcohol or peer-group pressure (“music concerts or gigs” could be an exception, though it has weaker loadings than the other items). Similarly, there are few obvious targets in settings implicated. Shopping, may be an exception, and it is hypothesized here to associate with shoplifting, though its effects are difficult to assess accurately because it is combined with going “out for something to eat” in a single item, confounding clear interpretation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022427811432641">
<title>Youth Clubs and Sports (Factor 5)</title>
<p>The final factor has loadings for going to “sports centers, youth clubs or groups” on one hand, and for going “to watch”… [soccer] … “or other sports” on the other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022427811432641">3</xref></sup> The combination of these two activities may be the least plausible of all principal components, with the 2 items involving quite different activity settings and types of activity. The first involves organized extracurricular activities in youth settings, the other being a spectator at sports events, likely alongside youth and adults. For this reason, the 2 items will be analyzed both together (as a single factor) and separately in the analysis that follows.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, the items do have sport as a common denominator, with 64 percent of youth going to “sports centers, youth clubs or groups” also indicating that sports featured among their activities in these settings. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Osgood et al. (1996)</xref>, participation in active sports is a structured activity, and we might infer the same for attendance at sports games. We would also expect authority figures to be present around these activities—club counselors, coaches, and perhaps facility staff or even police officers in the case of large sports events.</p>
<p>That said, it is hypothesized that this factor is associated with assault, given that sports may involve some risks for violence. Targets would include other people (either participant or spectators) whom, in sporting environments, are often in close proximity. The risk of conflict between opposing players or supporters in the competitive sporting environment could provide a context for violent escalations. This fits with Wortley’s descriptions of “frustrations” and “overcrowding” that constitute examples of criminogenic provocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427811432641">Wortley 2008</xref>). Empirical evidence has linked sports with violence among both participants and spectators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811432641">Dunning, Murphy, and Williams 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427811432641">Fields, Collins, and Comstock 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427811432641">Kreager 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022427811432641">Stott and Reicher 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811432641">Gottfredson and Soulé (2005)</xref> also provide evidence that crimes against persons are greatest at times youths tend to be congregated in space and most exposed to peers. Specifically, delinquent youth enrolled in after-school programs showed a substantially elevated rate of against person offenses in the after-school hours, when these programs tend to operate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022427811432641">
<title>Considering the Role of Travel (Factors 1, 3, 4, and 5)</title>
<p>Most activity items implicitly involve travel through space in order to arrive at activity settings. This is true for hanging around away from home, nightlife activities, cultural and consumer activity, and youth clubs and sports. It is less likely to be true, however, for time spent hanging around with friends locally (factor 2).</p>
<p>Travel often brings a youth into direct contact with public transport, a potential target for fare evasion. It is hypothesized, therefore, that these activity measures will tend to be associated with this offense.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0022427811432641">
<title>Modeling the Association of Routine Activities with Offending</title>
<p>In the second part of the analysis, models were constructed for each of five types of offending to assess their associations with routine activities, after controlling for other theoretically relevant variables.</p>
<sec id="section14-0022427811432641">
<title>Measuring Routine Activities</title>
<p>Routine activities were measured using the five estimated principal component factor scores produced by the analysis above (estimated and saved to the data using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 19 software). The alternative approach of summing high loading items to produce scales was not followed because it produced some Cronbach α scores that were too low to be considered reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427811432641">Nunnally 1978</xref>). Recognizing that principal component scores do not account for all variance in individual items, some alternative model specifications were constructed in which particular factors scores were replaced with their individual items. This was particularly relevant to the youth clubs and sports factor which, as noted, subsumes two activity items with quite distinct characteristics and settings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022427811432641">
<title>Offense Variables</title>
<p>The analysis examines some more common offenses measured by the ESYTC that also reflect a diversity of delinquent activity: assault, shoplifting, fare evasion, vandalism, and drug use. Binary measures for each of five offenses were modeled, reflecting whether or not respondents had committed the offense in the previous year. The prevalence of each the five offenses is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811432641">Table 2</xref>. Overall, 61 percent reported committing one or more of these offenses, while 37 percent reported at least two, and 22 percent three or more.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022427811432641">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>The ESYTC tracks detailed information on youth, and offers a rich variety of control variables that can help account for variation in respondents' propensity to offend. Variables relate to self-control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811432641">Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990</xref>), social bond theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427811432641">Hirschi 1969</xref>), subcultural theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811432641">Cloward and Ohlin 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427811432641">Miller 1958</xref>) and social learning theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811432641">Akers 1977</xref>) as well as broader sociodemographic variations. Additionally, delinquency variables from wave 3 were included to control for unmeasured criminogenic youth characteristics. Control variables used, and their derivations, are described below, and presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427811432641">Table 3</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section17-0022427811432641">
<title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p>Gender and ethnic minority status were both measured as binary variables, in the latter case reflecting the very small proportion of minority ethnic respondents in the survey (5 percent). Due to the fact that cohort members were the same age (about 15 years old at the time fourth survey), no age controls are appropriate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0022427811432641">
<title>Self-control</title>
<p>A 10-item scale (α = .83) was constructed from two subscales measured in wave 3 of the survey. These included a 6-item measure of impulsivity, including whether respondents feel that “having to plan things makes them less fun to do,” they “get into trouble because I do things without thinking,” or they “put down the first answer that comes into my head on a test, and often forget to check it later.” They also included a 4 item risk-taking subscale that asks respondents whether they agree with statements: “I like to test myself by doing something a bit risky,” “sometimes I take a risk just for the fun of it,” “I find it exciting to do things that get me into trouble,” or “excitement/adventure are more important than feeling safe.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0022427811432641">
<title>Parental supervision</title>
<p>A 4-item scale (Cronbach’s α of .79) was derived from 4 items asking respondents how often, when they went out during the last year, parents knew: “where you were going,” “who you were going out with,” “what you were doing,” and “what time you would be home.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0022427811432641">
<title>Delinquent peers</title>
<p>A 17-item scale combined responses to questions asking respondents whether their friends were involved in each of 17 different types of delinquency (α = .90).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0022427811432641">
<title>Social bond variables</title>
<p>A school attachment scale was built from eight attitude items, for example: “school is a waste of time,” “working hard at school is important,” “my school has a good atmosphere,” “I don’t feel that I fit in at school” (α = .72). A family attachment measure (α = .75) summed 2 items measuring how much time spent with parents on evenings, and how much time spent with parents on weekends, premised on the idea that a more cohesive, attached family will spend more time together.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0022427811432641">
<title>Moral values</title>
<p>To capture respondents' values regarding delinquent acts, responses to 12 items were summed (α = .81) asking respondents whether or not they thought it was okay to fight (4 items), lie (4 items) or steal (4 items), under a range of different circumstances.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0022427811432641">
<title>Prior delinquency</title>
<p>Historical measure of delinquency was calculated by combining each of 11 delinquency items from wave 3 of the ESYTC, measuring delinquency when the youth were approximately 14-years-old (α = .76). Additionally, binary measures were created for each of the dependent variables modeled, indicating whether the respondents had committed the same offense in the prior, wave 3 survey. This addressed the possibility that there were underlying tendencies, stable over time, in offense preference that were not otherwise captured by the independent variables included.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0022427811432641">
<title>Models and Results</title>
<p>Random intercepts mixed-effects logistic regression models of binary offending measures were used (with <italic>xtlogit</italic> in Stata 10.0). This allowed for the clustering of respondents within each of the 91 Edinburgh neighborhoods recognized in the ESYTC. Counts models were not used because count-based response categories in the questionnaire involved broad groupings on some values (i.e., 6 to 10 times, more than 10 times) preventing the calculation of a pure count measure.</p>
<p>Separate models were constructed for each of the five dependent variables, reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022427811432641">Table 4</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022427811432641">4</xref></sup> All models have highly significant Chi-square values (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and high McFadden pseudo-<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> values (between .32 and .42) indicating good fit. Independent variables are either in a binary or standardized form. In the former case, the presence (compared to the absence) of a characteristic corresponds to the odds ratio reported. For example, the odds of perpetrating assault for females are .55 of (i.e., 45 percent less than) the odds for males, other things being equal. In the case of standardized variables, the odds ratio compares a respondent with an otherwise similar youth who is a standard deviation apart on the measure of interest. Thus, for the measure of hanging around with friends locally, the respondent with the higher of the two scores has an odds of assaulting somebody that is 1.13 of (i.e., 13 percent higher than) the respondent with the lower score.</p>

<p>A number of control variables were consistently significant across most or all models: delinquent peers, moral values, and the same offense in wave 3. Others—gender, ethnic minority status, previous delinquency, self-control, family attachment, and parental supervision—have statistically significant relationships in one or more models, but lack significance in others. Only school attachment lacked any statistical associations across models. It is notable, in passing, therefore, that subcultural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811432641">Cloward and Ohlin 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811432641">Cohen 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427811432641">Miller 1958</xref>) and social learning theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811432641">Akers 1977</xref>) find considerable support from these results, given the strong and consistent association of delinquent peers with offending. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022427811432641">Meanwhile, Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990)</xref> self-control theory does not, given the modest effects for the self-control variable, while social bond theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427811432641">Hirschi 1969</xref>) finds limited support from measures of family or school attachment or parental supervision. The single most important predictor of offending for a particular crime is the commission of the same crime in the prior year, providing evidence for a pattern of enduring specialization in offending choices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427811432641">McGloin et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>More central to this analysis, however, are the relationships between routine activities and categories of delinquency. Overall, the various models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022427811432641">Table 4</xref> mostly confirm the general and specific hypotheses posed. First, there is a range of routine activities that are associated with at least some types of individual offending, and these extend beyond the unstructured socializing with peers in the absence of authority figures highlighted by the RATGD. Hanging around locally with friends, hanging out away from home, nightlife, cultural and consumer activity, and youth clubs and sports show at least some statistically significant positive associations with one or more of the delinquency measures. It is also useful to review <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022427811432641">Table 5</xref>, which uses 2 items in place of the summary factor score for youth clubs and sports, namely, going to “sports centers, youth clubs or groups” and going “to watch”…[soccer]…“or other sports.” The table, which reports only selected odds ratios, indicates that it is the youth extracurricular activities described by the first of these items that that have positive associations with crime, rather than attendance at sports events.</p>

<p>Supporting the second hypothesis, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022427811432641">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022427811432641">5</xref> shows important differences between different routine activities in the offenses they predict, based on the size and significance of individual coefficients. Additional, more specific, hypotheses that emerged from theorizing about the individual routine activities of Edinburgh youth were mostly supported. Specifically, models found statistically significant effects of nightlife with both assault and drug use, of hanging around (locally with friends or away from home) with a range of crime variables, of time spent at sports clubs, youth clubs and groups with assault, and of a range of activities involving travel with fare evasion. However, some findings were less consistent with specific hypotheses: going to soccer and sporting events was not associated with assault or fare evasion, and nightlife failed to predict fare evasion. While it was speculated that shopping might be associated with shoplifting, the former was combined with eating out in a single questionnaire item making this difficult to assess. Notwithstanding, an alternative model substituting individual items for the cultural and consumer activities factor score revealed no statistical association between going “shopping or out for something to eat” and shoplifting (the standardized item had a nonsignificant odds ratio of .97).</p>
<p>Finally, there was an unanticipated large and significant <italic>negative</italic> relationship between drug use and certain structured activities: involvement in youth clubs and sports and cultural and consumer activities. It is possible that time spent in these activities is time spent away from settings where opportunities for drug use are present, consistent with the theory presented here. It is also possible that selection effects play a role: people who choose to spend their time participating in these activities are also the kinds of people who avoid drugs anyway, perhaps as part of a healthier lifestyle. A significant negative association of cultural and consumer activities with assault might have similar kinds of explanations.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Environmental criminology has tended to distance itself from the concerns of traditional criminology—in particular, theories that try to explain individual patterns of offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427811432641">Wortley and Mazerolle 2008</xref>). This article sits within a more marginal tradition of scholarship seeking to bridge the gap between the two approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811432641">Birkbeck and LaFree 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Osgood et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022427811432641">Wikström et al. 2010</xref>). It has considered both offender characteristics and the contingent nature of criminal events. It is staked on the idea that environmental theories can be applied to concerns of traditional criminology by asking the question: what lifestyle characteristics of individuals place them in situations where opportunities for crime, and in turn their rates of offending, are greater?</p>
<p>In doing so, the article has re-examined the existing RATGD approach that has applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811432641">Cohen and Felson’s (1979)</xref> routine activity theory to individual offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Osgood et al. 1996</xref>) and has highlighted unstructured socializing with peers in the absence of authority figures as a core criminogenic activity. While confirming, in broad-brush terms, the generalized predictions of RATGD, the article has drawn on additional theoretical ideas developed from environmental criminology to extend the explanatory scope of the RATGD approach. The article has argued that the presence of crime targets and facilitators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811432641">Clarke and Eck 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427811432641">Wortley 2008</xref>) in settings where routine activities take place may also help account for offending behavior and, furthermore, that these characteristics will tend to vary substantially between settings in the types of offending they support. Thus, a range of discrete routine activities of youth that take them away from their home, school, or workplace were hypothesized to have varying effects on offending. Hypotheses were mostly confirmed: hanging around locally with friends was associated with a range of street crimes, nightlife was associated with assault and drug use, sports and other youth club involvement were associated with assault, and some, though not all, activities involving travel were associated with fare evasion. While specific conclusions found might show variations with other contexts or respondent characteristics, the general conclusion—that routine activities vary in their relationships with offending behavior—is probably robust.</p>
<p>While the research confirms the value of RATGD, it also supports theory that involves some divergent or contrary predictions to the original RATGD perspective. In particular, it provides evidence that structured activities are not necessarily an improvement over unstructured activities in their effects on crime. Thus, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811432641">Osgood et al.’s (1996)</xref> original theory is consistent the idea that after-school programs reduce offending by reducing the time spent in unstructured, unsupervised socializing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022427811432641">Osgood, Anderson, and Shaffer 2005</xref>), the current research, like that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811432641">Gottfredson and Soulé (2005)</xref>, provides evidence that these same settings are associated with greater risks of violence.</p>
<p>Though beyond the core conclusions of this article, it is interesting to contemplate how lifestyles, and associated routine activities, may have explanatory power with respect to short-term changes in offending patterns over time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811432641">Horney, Osgood, and Marshall (1995)</xref> have demonstrated that changes in “local life circumstances” such as involvement in relationships, substance use, employment and criminal justice supervision produce changes in rates of offending and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427811432641">McGloin et al. (2007)</xref> have shown how these variations in produce changes in levels of offender specialization. Short-term changes in lifestyles—particularly recreational lifestyles—may also be forms of local life circumstances that could help account for changes in rates and patterns of offending. This plausibly presumes that these lifestyles are subject to short-term variation through time, perhaps as people’s membership in sports clubs, taste for nightlife, friendships, and so on, evolve.</p>
<p>The policy implications of this article also warrant comment. As noted already, they place a question mark over the effects of after-school programs, often considered a useful intervention to reduce youth delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022427811432641">Osgood, Anderson, and Shaffer 2005</xref>), given their associations with assaults (see also Gottfredson and Soulé 2004). More generally, conclusions caution against the uncritical connection of apparently constructive, structured activities with crime prevention benefits. There may also be useful implications for the management of offenders under correctional supervision. In addition to conventional risk and needs assessment of offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811432641">Gottfredson and Moriarty 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022427811432641">Miller and Lin 2007</xref>), an analysis of routine activities and their intersection with situational risks, could provide a foundation for more sophisticated patterns of monitoring, supervision, and intervention. This idea is in line with a vision of “environmental corrections” outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427811432641">Cullen, Eck, and Lowenkamp (2002)</xref> that argues for the use of environmental theories as a basis for effective interventions within community corrections.</p>
<p>Finally, research to build on the ideas presented here could follow a number of directions. It could test conclusions on samples from different locations and population characteristics. Statistical relationships could be studied longitudinally to provide stronger validity to causal inferences, and allow for an examination in changes in lifestyles and delinquency over time. Perhaps more profoundly, new directions for research could couple survey research with contemporary crime analysis approaches, including the mapping of specific crimes and environmental features to locations in space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811432641">Caplan, Kennedy, and Miller 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811432641">Chainey, Tompson, and Uhlig 2008</xref>). Specific answers to survey questions regarding time spent in specific locations (e.g., specific pubs, discos, sports centers, or street corners) could be linked to the characteristics of those locations that emerge from crime analysis. This is ambitious, though some scholars have already developed approaches that, in part, resemble this framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427811432641">Bichler, Christie, and Sechrest 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022427811432641">Wikström et al. 2010</xref>). Such an approach could add substantially to the explanatory power of a routine activities approach and further develop the themes pioneered in this article. This line of inquiry promises to make important contributions to our understanding of the nexus between crime propensity and opportunity, representing an important challenge for criminology in the years ahead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811432641">Cullen 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>For example, 50 percent of both included and excluded cases were female, 32 percent in each group reported assaulting somebody in the prior last year, while 50 percent of included cases reported going out with friends most days, compared to 41 percent of excluded cases. Ethnicity showed the largest difference, atypical compared to all other variables compared: 11 percent of excluded cases were ethnic minorities, compared to 5 percent of included cases. However, here as elsewhere, differences translated into small effects on the participant pool, with exclusions taking the proportion of ethnic minority youth from from 6 percent for the whole wave 4 cohort to 5 percent in the analysis subset.</p>

<p>A sizable minority of the 15-year-olds in the study go to pubs or over 18 discos and clubs contrary to the law. While UK licensing restrictions restrict the purchase and consumption of alcohol to those aged 18 and above, in practice these are less rigorously enforced than in the United States, with personal identification not routinely required to buy alcohol. This means that underage teenagers can typically find pubs or bars that will serve them. For example, in 2004, a UK police sting operation, that used 13- to 14-year-old volunteers who tried to get served in 650 establishments, found that 51 percent of bars and pubs served the underage drinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811432641">Just Drinks 2004</xref>).</p>

</disp-formula>The conditional intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs; representing the proportion of overall variance accounted for within neighborhoods, conditional upon covariates) reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022427811432641">Table 4</xref> ranges from .01 to .06 (i.e., 1 percent to 6 percent), with drug use showing the highest ICC. Though somewhat modest in size, these ICCs in combination with the quite large cluster sizes (average 34) present risks of Type I error if clustering is not accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427811432641">Muthen and Satorra 1995</xref>).</p>
