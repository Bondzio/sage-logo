<p>The multispecies commons is the kind of place in which human–animal entanglements are made most explicit. It is where social, biological and historical processes are so inextricably entwined with wider ecological processes as to be inseparable. Here I describe one such place: the area outside a gate in the ancient, defensive wall around the historic city of Harar, Ethiopia. It was at this place that a solitary, poisoned hyena set in motion a series of events which culminated in a conflict between two hyena clans; a conflict in which the local humans were participants. To gain an understanding of the events I follow the threads of histories, landscapes, territoriality and social engagement between species to reveal how this place demands interdisciplinary study. It dramatically exemplifies the ways in which humans and non-humans are entangled in more-than-social processes through which they co-shape each others’ worlds. The multispecies commons explicitly deconstructs limited conceptions of the social and weaves them back together with multiple other threads that coalesce to create a greater, tangled web of ecological processes.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>Les communautés multi-espèces sont des lieux où l’enchevêtrement humain–animal est le plus explicite. Ce sont des lieux où les processus sociaux, biologiques et historiques sont si inextricablement liés aux processus écologiques plus larges qu’ils en sont inséparables. L’auteur décrit ici un tel lieu: l’espace extérieur devant une porte dans l’ancien mur de défense qui entoure la ville historique de Harar, en Ethiopie. A cet endroit même une hyène solitaire qui avait ingéré du poison déclencha une série d’évènements dont le point culminant fut un conflit entre deux clans de hyènes, conflit dont les humains présents en ce lieu devinrent partie prenante. Pour essayer de comprendre ces événements, l’auteur dévide le fil des histoires, des paysages, de la territorialité et des imbrications sociales entre les espèces afin de montrer l’urgence d’une étude interdisciplinaire de ce lieu. Il est un exemple dramatique de la manière dont les humains et les non-humains sont enchevêtrés dans des processus au-delà-du-social au travers desquels ils co-modèlent leurs mondes réciproques. Les communautés multi-espèces déconstruisent explicitement les conceptions limitées du social et les re-tissent entre elles et avec de multiples autres fils qui s’entremêlent pour créer un réseau plus vaste et complexe de processus écologiques.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is a broad commons in front of a gate in the defensive wall around the Old Town of Harar in Ethiopia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0539018413477521">Figure 1</xref>). The gate is named ‘Argobberi’, after the people who live in the hills surrounding Harar and come to the town to trade: the Argobba. On any given day people converge on the commons in front of Argobberi to buy and sell. The traders – mostly women – drive their donkeys loaded with produce to the town and lay the goods out on the ground. The donkeys wait patiently, parked in a space below the commons, while the women sit on the ground with their produce, calling to passers-by, reprimanding children, talking amongst themselves. They raise their voices in competition with the loud ‘tuk tuk tuk’ of the three-wheeled taxis taking on passengers. It is a noisy, busy, social place. In the photograph below, the long shadows on the ground indicate that it is late afternoon. The firewood sellers have arrived; they have set up in the middle of the road. If a truck comes, the women will push their bundles to one side to let the truck pass and then push them back again until another comes along. To the left of the wooden gate, beside the modern road that passes through the wall, some women are selling <italic>chat.</italic> The leaves of the <italic>chat</italic> plant are popular in Harar among most ethnic groups. When chewed, they provide a stimulant effect, a focusing of attention and a feeling of wellbeing. The cut leaves soon lose their potency when exposed to the sun; hence the <italic>chat</italic> sellers trade in the shadows cast by the wall. The people buying <italic>chat</italic> will take their bagsful home and chew the leaves well into the evening. Meanwhile, as the sky darkens, the traders at Argobberi will light paraffin lamps and torches so that the place will shimmer with flickering flames and an orange glow. Most of them will pack up and leave at around 9pm. Some of the <italic>chat</italic> sellers and the women who sell bread rolls will remain until about 10pm, after which they will pack up and go to their homes. Darkness and silence will envelop the place. Indigents will make their beds in the shelter of the gateway, the occasional <italic>chat</italic>-affected man will lean against a post in deep contemplation; and dogs will lie down in the road. As the night unfolds, spotted hyenas will pass through the gate on their way into and out of the Old Town, their movements concealed by darkness and a maze of narrow laneways.</p>

<title>A found subject</title>
<p>On the night of 12 June 2010, I was walking up the hill towards Argobberi when I encountered a sub-adult spotted hyena lying in the road outside the gate. It was early in the night – 9.30pm – so there were still many people at the place; a crowd of about a dozen people gathered around the hyena who was writhing, squealing and twitching, apparently suffering the effects of poison. One man directed his flashlight at the hyena; some girls were giggling; a sheikh was standing over the hyena, reciting a verse from the Quran. Someone had gone to fetch a man named Yusuf from a place further down the road. Yusuf arrived and turned the hyena over with his foot before calling for a box of matches. He lit several matches in front of the hyena’s nose, each of which was extinguished by the breeze. He then tore up some rags, which he lit with a match before deliberately extinguishing the flames and holding the smouldering rags under the hyena’s nose. Someone arrived with some limes. Yusuf took a lime and bit it in half. He held the hyena’s mouth in one hand and squeezed the lime so that juice drizzled in. He was having difficulty so he asked for the assistance of a young man, who squeezed the lime while Yusuf prised open the hyena’s mouth. Meanwhile, another man arrived with a rickety wheelbarrow, and Yusuf and two others lifted the hyena into it. The poisoned hyena was squealing and writhing spasmodically as they wheeled it down the hill. About halfway down, the wheelbarrow collapsed under the hyena’s weight. The men resorted to carrying both wheelbarrow and hyena down the road to the space outside Yusuf’s house. Following the group was the sheikh, still reciting Quranic verses.</p>
<p>On arrival at the place in front of Yusuf’s house, the squealing of the poisoned hyena attracted the attention of some other hyenas who were lying around in the dark. They stood up and began to growl and whoop in the fashion of agitated hyenas. Yusuf’s family came out of their house, and his wife was asked to fetch some milk. Meanwhile the whooping and growling of the hyenas had attracted others of the clan so that there were at least twenty agitated hyenas present and more arriving by the minute. The milk arrived and Yusuf held the poisoned hyena’s mouth open while the white liquid was poured in. There was no immediate effect, and the hyenas had by that stage worked themselves up into a frenzied state. Yusuf decided to lift the hyena out of the tub of the wheelbarrow and place it on the ground. By that time, most of the people present had retreated to the stone step in front of the shrine at the side of the open space. The hyenas were creating a considerable din, which was echoed by the nearby hills. Yusuf and his son were the last to retreat, and, as they too stood up on the step, the hyenas approached. One large female was at the front of the group. She was in what could only be described as a state of rage. However, she was hesitant in coming forward. A smaller, sub-adult hyena stepped past the large female and approached the poisoned hyena. The sub-adult bit the skin of the poisoned hyena’s back and dragged him backwards to where the other hyenas were waiting. At that point, the large female picked up the hyena in her mouth and marched off into the darkness with him. She was followed by thirty-one other hyenas, growling and whooping; their manes and tails bristling. The people began to disperse. The sheikh was one of the last to leave; he finished his recitations and walked down the road, disappearing into the darkness.</p>
<p>On the second night after this incident, there was some unusual activity at the place outside Yusuf’s house. One hyena was uttering a series of low groans while the other hyenas present were agitated. They were scratching at the ground and gathering around at various places, sniffing together. As more hyenas joined in they became more and more vocal. Then a group of four hyenas broke off from the activities and went running up towards the gate at Argobberi. As soon as these hyenas reached the top of the hill, they turned and went running back down; two hyenas ran down in the lead while another two marched back down the hill with their manes bristling and tails erect. Before the last two had reached Yusuf’s house, the first two came running back with another two hyenas following. The now larger group of six hyenas ran up the hill towards Argobberi, ignoring the people on the road as they ran past them.</p>
<p>At the top of the hill, under the streetlight outside the gate at Argobberi, there stood another six hyenas. Their manes and tails were bristling as they scratched at the road, creating a cloud of dust within which they were but silhouettes under the streetlight. All of the people who had been walking through the gate had vacated the road and were standing under the verandas of the nearby shops, watching the hyenas. The six hyenas who had run up the road from Yusuf’s house arrived in front of the gate. They stood no more than 10 metres from the other agitated hyenas and there began a cacophony of growling and whooping. The two groups of hyenas appeared to be about to attack each other, but neither group approached close enough for there to be physical contact. Instead, each group remained cohesive and took turns lunging at their opposites. All of the humans present, transfixed by this coming together of hyenas, stood and stared. Then, before any physical contact had been made between the two groups, the ones who had run up the hill broke away from the stand-off and hustled back towards the place beside Yusuf’s house, growling as they went. The others remained beneath the streetlight for some time, watching their opposites retreat back down the hill. Then one by one they turned and marched back in the other direction along the road that encircles the Old Town of Harar. The people present collected their things together and went their respective ways. It was 10.15pm, and human activities at the Argobberi gate were winding down for the night.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>To the uninitiated, the events described above must be somewhat perplexing. The Old Town of Harar is a densely populated urban centre – there are 21,000 people concentrated in an area of 0.6 square kilometres, and beyond the Old Town, another 78,000 people occupy the suburbs of Harar’s New Town. The appearance of a spotted hyena on a crowded road is unusual for an African town of those proportions. Moreover, a sheikh standing over such a hyena, reciting verses from the Quran, is unheard of. Yusuf’s actions too demand an explanation. The question why he waved smoking matches and rags under the nose of the hyena, and squeezed lime juice and poured milk into its mouth arises in tandem with why a large number of hyenas were lying around outside his house. And as with the actions of the humans, the actions of the hyenas demand an explanation. Why did the hyenas become so agitated on the arrival of their young, poisoned conspecific? What was the significance of the aggression between two groups of hyenas two nights later on the road where the poisoned hyena was found?</p>
<p>Here, I want to address these questions because they speak of something beyond the sum of two species. I want to follow the threads of (pre)history, landscape, species and society, and argue that these are all elements of a shared ecology of humans and hyenas. The threads come together at the gate at Argobberi and express most dramatically the theme of this special issue: the Shared Life. I begin with the most obvious question: Why were hyenas and humans together at that place and time?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0539018413477521">
<title>The multispecies commons untangled</title>
<p>Our two genera, <italic>Homo</italic> and <italic>Crocuta</italic>, have such a long history of coexistence that we could be considered ecologically related. Throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene, ancestral hyenas occurred with ancestral humans across both Africa and Eurasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0539018413477521">Rohland et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0539018413477521">Schreve, 2006</xref>). The two groups competed over scavengeable carcasses, and occasionally humans fell victim to hyena predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0539018413477521">Boaz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0539018413477521">Lee-Thorpe, Thackeray &amp; van der Merwe, 2000</xref>: 572). However, it was humans who gained the ascendancy. Hyenas disappeared from Eurasia at the end of the Pleistocene and have been exterminated or excluded from much of Africa in historical times. Yet they have persisted in Ethiopia and in relatively high numbers. One possible reason for this is that Ethiopia was never settled by Europeans. In South Africa the arrival of settlers and the introduction of sheep engendered conflict between spotted hyenas and pastoralists. The inevitable consequence was the extermination of hyenas in the southern part of the continent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018413477521">Beinart, 1998</xref>: 180). Ethiopia, on the other hand, was colonized from within. Under Menelik II, the Abyssinians annexed much of the land that constitutes modern Ethiopia. However, unlike colonization in other parts of Africa, the Abyssinians did not bring radically new ways of managing the landscape, nor did they bring ideologies of extermination. The established farmers maintained their traditional practices, and relations between humans and hyenas continued as before. Indeed, early historical accounts of Ethiopia paint a picture of hyenas as abundant as sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0539018413477521">Gade, 2006</xref>: 612).</p>
<p>Yet the conditions for hyenas in Ethiopia have not remained unchanged. Whereas previously hyenas competed with lions over wild prey, massive deforestation in the country reduced the availability of prey species, and the lions have largely disappeared. This has in fact benefited the hyenas in the region. The absence of lions has reduced one possible cause of mortality. Furthermore the forests have been largely replaced with agricultural production. In the Harerge region, the most abundant crop is <italic>chat</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018413477521">Gebissa, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0539018413477521">2008</xref>) to which the hyenas do no harm. In fact, the presence of hyenas is believed by farmers to deter <italic>chat</italic> thieves as well as Salt’s dik-diks who would otherwise take the leaves.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, spotted hyenas are also sufficiently flexible in their feeding habits to be able to adapt to a landscape from which wild species have all but disappeared. Nowadays, hyenas in Ethiopia rely largely on anthropogenic foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0539018413477521">Abay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0539018413477521">Gade, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0539018413477521">Yirga et al., 2012</xref>). They scavenge from dumps where they obtain skin and bones, they consume livestock dead from diseases, they occasionally prey on unguarded animals or break into huts and take sheltered livestock. In Harar, the food preferences of the people benefit the hyenas greatly; as in much of Ethiopia, people in Harar consume a lot of meat. Two slaughter-yards in Harar – one providing meat for Christians, the other for Muslims – produce and discard great quantities of skin, bones and entrails. So, too, do households, and a lot of their leftover bones and bits of fat are thrown into the streets in the knowledge that they will be consumed by hyenas during the night. Any uneaten part of an animal in Harar ends up either at the garbage dump, in the streets or in open garbage containers, all of which are accessible to hyenas.</p>
<p>Possibly more important for hyenas in Harar is the kind of meat that the locals do not eat: donkeys. These pack animals are ubiquitous in the landscape; they are an invaluable means of transporting goods and materials. The number of donkeys in Ethiopia is estimated to be four to five million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0539018413477521">Gebreab et al., 2005</xref>: 46). In combination with the estimated number of hyenas (1000–2000, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0539018413477521">Mills &amp; Hofer, 1998</xref>: 74), this makes for a ratio of 2000–5000 donkeys for every single hyena.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0539018413477521">1</xref></sup> And each and every one of those donkeys is inedible to the human population because both Muslims and Christians observe a prohibition against eating hoofed animals. The Oromo have a saying – ‘whether in life or death, it is inevitable: a donkey will be eaten by a hyena’ – which alludes to the fact that regardless of whether a donkey falls prey to hyenas, dies of disease or of old age, it will inevitably end up as food for hyenas.</p>
<p>In Harar, the local hyenas are also directly provisioned by people. The man named Yusuf, who arrived at Argobberi and attended to the poisoned hyena, is one of two men in Harar who feed hyenas on a nightly basis for the entertainment of tourists. This practice began in the 1950s or 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0539018413477521">Kruuk, 1968</xref>: 51). According to some informants, a man who worked at the old tannery on the east side of the town began throwing flesh scrapings to the hyenas who congregated outside. Before long he was doing so on a regular basis, and tour guides began taking tourists to see the feeding. Wider, global processes have fostered increasing numbers of tourists in Harar, and the majority of these are taken to see the hyenas being fed. At present there are two government-sanctioned places where hyenas are fed for tourism purposes, and several others where enterprising individuals are trying to establish feeding relationships with hyenas. This provisioning does not contribute significantly to the available resources of the Harar hyenas; if the scraps were not handed to the hyenas, they would end up in the streets or at the garbage dump, and hyenas would eat them regardless. However, it does embolden the hyenas in the presence of people and prepares them for their food searches in the Old Town, where the narrow laneways foster close proximity to humans.</p>
<p>Yusuf feeds hyenas in an open space in front of a shrine beside his house. From about 7pm, tourists arrive at the shrine. Yusuf takes a bucket of scraps, sits on a rock in front of the hyenas, and drapes scraps of skin and meat over a stick from which the hyenas take the food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0539018413477521">Figure 2</xref>). This explains why there were several hyenas already present when Yusuf arrived with a poisoned hyena in the wheelbarrow. The hyenas he feeds spend the early part of the evening outside his house and linger there for a couple of hours after the tourists have gone, waiting for the Old Town to become quiet so they can pass through openings in the town wall and search for more food. The feeding place is one of the core areas for that hyena clan, and I discuss the importance of its relationship to Argobberi below; but first I want to address the matter of why there is a gate at Argobberi (although it is more pertinent to explore the reasons why there was a wall, as the reason for the existence of the gate follows from that).</p>

<p>In the 16th century, Harar became the capital of the Adal Sultanate. The charismatic Muslim leader Ahmed ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi married a Harari and moved his base of operations to the town (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0539018413477521">Abbink, 1998</xref>: 114; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0539018413477521">Davis, 1963</xref>: 571). From there, he waged war against the Christian Abyssinians in the west until he was killed during the battle of Wayna Daga. As a consequence of the war, the Adalites and the Abyssinians were so politically and militarily weakened that a power vacuum was created in the south. This was soon filled by new players on the scene: the Oromo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0539018413477521">Levine, 1974</xref>: 76). With no centralized government and a system of age sets which required that each community wage war against a neighbour every 8 years, the Oromo played to a different set of rules than the Muslims and Christians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0539018413477521">Legesse, 1973</xref>: 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0539018413477521">Waldron, 1984</xref>: 23). The boundaries of their territories expanded organically and rapidly; they simply absorbed other peoples as they ‘broke like a tidal wave over Ethiopia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0539018413477521">Trimingham, 1965</xref>: 187). Within decades, the Oromo had taken over much of the former Christian and Muslim territories and increased their numbers with the peoples they assimilated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0539018413477521">Keller, 1995</xref>: 624). Ahmed ibn Ibrahim’s successor in Harar, Amir Nur, foresaw the danger that the Oromo expansion posed to an undefended Harar and began the construction of a defensive wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0539018413477521">Pankhurst, 1982</xref>: 52; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0539018413477521">Waldron, 1984</xref>: 24). When the Oromo came, they failed to take the town behind the wall; however, they occupied all of the land around Harar. They brought with them their own belief system and pastoral ways so that all that remained of the once-vast Harari dominion was less than a square kilometre of stone dwellings behind a 4-metre-high wall. Harar became an island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0539018413477521">Braukämper, 1977</xref>: 34).</p>
<p>The gate at Argobberi is built into the wall at the place where traders enter Harar. Historically, caravans entered through Argobberi after trekking across the Somali plains from the Red Sea ports of Zayla and Berbera. These places connected Harar with the Middle East, India and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018413477521">Hecht, 1987</xref>: 1). Indeed it was through Argobberi that the English explorer Richard Burton passed when he visited Harar in 1855 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0539018413477521">Burton, 1856</xref>: 293). He was the first European to visit Harar. The trade from the east has since declined and now it is mostly local farmers from the adjacent Erer valley who pass through the gate. Meanwhile, Hararis pass through the gate in the opposite direction as they go out to their farms in the surrounding countryside. And almost every Harari passes through Argobberi after death, as it is through that gate that the road leads to the cemetery. Yet, the history of the gate at Argobberi is not restricted to the affairs of humans; the hyenas of Harar have a history at Argobberi as well.</p>
<p>There are three hyena clans in the vicinity of Harar and two of those clans’ territories include the Old Town (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0539018413477521">Figure 3</xref>). One of these is the Aboker clan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0539018413477521">2</xref></sup> Their dens are located just north of the suburbs of the New Town, overlooking farmland. They are regularly provisioned at one of the two official hyena-feeding operations and they also obtain a lot of scraps from a butcher’s shop at the sportsground northwest of the Old Town. The Aboker hyenas normally enter the Old Town through Assumberi, the gate on the north side of the wall, or through two ‘hyena holes’, which facilitate entry for hyenas and people prepared to stoop on entry. The other is the Sofi clan. The Sofi dens are located in dense vegetation about one kilometre east of Harar. These hyenas are the ones provisioned by Yusuf and they also obtain a lot of food from the garbage dump, which lies within their territory. The Sofi hyenas normally enter the Old Town through the gate at Suqutatberi, two hyena holes and several drains. Both clans converge on the Main Market in the Old Town after about 10pm. They travel via the maze of narrow laneways towards the centre of the town where several butcher’s shops leave bones and scraps out for enterprising hyenas. And this is where some interesting things happen.</p>

<p>In other studies, hyenas have been found to maintain exclusive territories, which they mark and aggressively defend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0539018413477521">Boydston, Morelli &amp; Holekamp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0539018413477521">Kruuk, 1972</xref>: 256; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0539018413477521">van Lawick-Goodall &amp; van Lawick-Goodall, 1970</xref>: 149). Hyenas mark and recognize the boundaries of these territories in several ways: pasting, defecating, scratching and enacting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0539018413477521">Kruuk, 1972</xref>: 259). When pasting, a hyena protrudes its anal pouch and secretes a scented paste on a long grass stalk that it straddles. This paste carries a signature that identifies the hyena and by extension the clan to which it belongs. These scent marks are often deposited at clan boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018413477521">Burgener et al., 2009</xref>). Another way in which hyenas delineate their boundaries is by creating latrines. They deposit clusters of conspicuous white droppings at places along the outer perimeters of their territories (although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0539018413477521">Mills &amp; Gorman, 1987</xref>). They also mark boundaries with scent from their interdigital glands when they scratch at the ground. Presumably the scent carries a distinctive signature, as with the paste. Lastly, hyenas recognize boundaries by simply observing their clan-mates engaging in inter-clan disputes along boundaries or witnessing clan-mates pull up short when prey they are pursuing crosses a territorial boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0539018413477521">van Lawick-Goodall &amp; van Lawick-Goodall, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>All of the above methods are limited or unavailable to hyenas in Harar’s Old Town. After Harar was encircled by a wall, the town could only grow internally. While the internal area of the Old Town remained the same, houses and laneways multiplied, and the result is a maze of narrow laneways lined with high walls which surround clusters of dwellings built one up against another. The consequence of this kind of urban development for hyenas is an inability to establish and maintain territorial boundaries. Almost all grass that has the temerity to grow in Harar’s laneways is soon trampled by people or consumed by goats. Whatever grass survives is sparse and scattered so that it is impossible for hyenas to paste along a consistent boundary. Moreover, any faeces deposited in the laneways during the night are promptly swept up in the morning by women’s co-operatives so that hyenas are unable to create latrines. Hyenas could potentially scratch scent into the dirt between the cobblestones, and possibly the foot traffic during the day would not completely trample and disperse it. However, this can only be done along a laneway, and it is impossible for a laneway to be a boundary; it is a corridor. Two groups of hyenas cannot engage in a territorial dispute over a laneway; in order to do so, they would have to be within centimetres of each other in the confined space. Hence I have seen some unusual interactions between hyenas of different clans where, instead of aggression, there was nothing but wariness shown on their part. This often occurred at the Main Market. On one occasion I followed a Sofi hyena from the gate at Suqutatberi to the Main Market, where it encountered and greeted two hyenas who I then followed over the hill and into the Aboker hyenas’ territory. I had witnessed a peaceful greeting between hyenas from different clans. On another occasion I encountered a Sofi hyena eating a bone well inside what I thought was Aboker territory, when two Aboker hyenas approached. They were outwardly unconcerned with each other and went their separate ways. As a consequence, I find it impossible to accurately depict the clan boundaries in Harar’s Old Town because the hyenas themselves are not even sure of where these lie. Instead there is a broad shared area within the Old Town which hyenas from both clans use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0539018413477521">Figure 4</xref>). However, that shared area ends abruptly just outside the gate at Argobberi.</p>

<p>The encounter I described above – between the two groups of hyenas – was in fact inter-clan aggression involving the Sofi and the Aboker hyenas, and it was almost certainly sparked by the incident two nights earlier involving the poisoned sub-adult hyena. It is most probably a coincidence that the poisoned hyena wound up at the place outside the gate at Argobberi; however, the consequences were profound. Without recourse to an index of spot patterns, it is difficult to recognize hyenas by physical characteristics alone. Yusuf, the hyena feeder, relies on behavioural characteristics to recognize the hyenas he is feeding. The poisoned hyena on the road was contorted and twitching, so Yusuf had no way of ascertaining whether it was one of the hyenas from the Sofi clan he regularly feeds. He simply assumed it was a Sofi hyena and brought the sub-adult to the place beside his house where several Sofi hyenas were lying down. It appeared to me that the Sofi hyenas immediately recognized the sub-adult as a stranger and became enraged that a hyena from another clan was in their core feeding area. They became so aggressive that the people present retreated to the steps of the shrine. The large female at the forefront of the aggressive hyenas was Koti, the dominant matriarch of the Sofi clan. She was bold and aggressive but still wary of humans and reluctant to come forward and take the poisoned hyena from in front of the people. Instead, it was a young hyena named Willi who came forward and dragged the hyena back a short way. Willi was in fact habituated to the close proximity of humans through my actions in conducting research at the place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0539018413477521">Baynes-Rock, 2012</xref>). He had no qualms about approaching so close, and was able to drag the young hyena back for Koti to take him off into the farmland, where he was presumably killed. For two nights after that incident, the Sofi hyenas displayed a lot of territorial behaviour at the feeding place: social sniffing, scratching and vocalizing.</p>
<p>I can only conclude that the inter-clan aggression that occurred two nights after the incident with the poisoned hyena was initiated by the Aboker hyenas. It was they who were waiting outside the gate at Argobberi when the group of six Sofi hyenas ran up the road to confront them. I am not sure whether the Aboker hyenas collectively knew that one of their clan-mates was missing. In fact it is still an assumption on my part that the poisoned hyena was an Aboker hyena. However, they had been able to hear the sounds from the feeding place when the raging Sofi hyenas took the poisoned sub-adult off into the farmland. The Sofi feeding place is only one kilometre from the Aboker dens. I suggest that the Aboker hyenas recognized that some kind of interaction had taken place between Sofi hyenas and one of their own. However, regardless of how these hyenas knew about the events of the night of the poisoned hyena, they were sufficiently aggrieved to have gone to the place outside the gate at Argobberi and challenged the Sofi hyenas to engage in a territorial dispute. Several of the Sofi hyenas responded and went running up the road to where the Aboker hyenas were waiting. There was a lot of aggression displayed by both groups but no physical contact. In that way, it was more like a ritualized display in which the two clans were enacting and reasserting the boundary rather than a conflict over a disputable, moveable line of demarcation. Eventually, the Sofi hyenas were the first to disperse and, significantly, the Aboker hyenas did not pursue them. They simply stood for a while before turning and marching off into the heart of their own territory. The strictly defined boundary outside the gate at Argobberi remained; a marked contrast to the vague shared areas on the other side of the gate, inside the Old Town.</p>
<p>For me, the inter-clan aggression outside the gate at Argobberi was akin to the realization of an expectation. I was told on numerous occasions by many people in Harar that the hyenas did not fight inside the Old Town; they only came together to fight outside the gate at Argobberi. Indeed, so often was I told this that I ceased writing it down; it was simply a matter of fact. In this respect, the place has a shared history. Both people and hyenas come to recognize and remember this place as a locale for territorial disputes through participation and the passing down of knowledge. The people who vacated the streets when the two clans of hyenas came together under the streetlight were as complicit in the dispute as the hyenas who were growling and kicking up dust. For any hyena and human initiates present, it was a dramatic first experience, and something they would remember for the future. And they passed the history of the place on to others; the people through stories and the hyenas through inciting young hyenas to follow them up the hill to the place outside the gate where they faced down their opponents. The gate at Argobberi is more than an edifice. It is a mutually constructed, historicized, politicized, meaningful place in the minds of both hyenas and humans who participate in the dramas that are enacted there.</p>
<p>For very many people in Harar, it is uncontroversial that the territorial boundary at Argobberi is for hyenas partly socially constructed. These people consider that spotted hyenas are very much like themselves in their social organization. According to these people, hyenas hold meetings, make supplications for food and communicate detailed messages to conspecifics and to humans who can understand hyena language. Furthermore, hyenas have an understanding of and capacity for revenge. They act against conspecifics who kill livestock because they know humans will demand retribution for the killing. They also attack people who harm or insult hyenas. ‘Hyena has a brain like a human.’ This is the comment by a Harari father to a son in an account of hyenas taking action against the boy after he dropped rocks on them. This also goes some way to explaining the persistence of hyenas in Harar. Where the people are socially engaged with hyenas, they do not conceive of them as objects in the landscape that can be acted upon with impunity. Any attempt at eradication of hyenas is unthinkable for Hararis because hyenas cannot be acted upon without harmful consequences.</p>
<p>This perceived similarity of hyenas and humans in Harar goes a long way towards explaining the actions of Yusuf the hyena feeder: he was treating the poisoned hyena like a human. In most parts of Ethiopia, if a person experiences an epileptic seizure, it is standard practice to try and alleviate the seizure by striking a match, extinguishing it and waving the smoke under the sufferer’s nose. Thus, Yusuf’s first actions on encountering the poisoned hyena can be explained: he assumed that the spasms the hyena was experiencing were symptomatic of an epileptic seizure. Consequently, he took the customary remedial action for humans. Then, after it was suggested that the hyena had been poisoned, Yusuf altered the treatment, but remained within the conventions of treatment for humans. If a girl in Harar is being compelled to marry against her will, she might drink a quantity of bleach, whether as a cry for help, a protest, a suicide attempt or combination of these. The conventional first-aid in these cases is to administer lime juice. The acidity of the limes is supposed to nullify the alkalinizing effect of the bleach. Hence, Yusuf squeezed lime juice into the hyena’s mouth as, in his eyes, what works or should work for people should also work for hyenas. As for the milk, that was my idea. I recalled the advice given in Australia for poisoning – administer quantities of milk – and made the suggestion after Yusuf’s efforts were failing to have any effect.</p>
<p>While we both recognized that the young hyena had been poisoned, Yusuf interpreted the response of the Sofi clan members in a different fashion to myself. On arriving at the gate at Argobberi on the night of the poisoning incident, Yusuf’s first question to me was if the poisoned hyena lying in the road was Willi, the Sofi hyena mentioned above. The sub-adult did resemble Willi but I knew from the spot patterns that it was not him. Thus, having not recognized him as any of the Sofi hyenas I knew, I assumed him to be an Aboker hyena. Yusuf, however, did not identify hyenas by their spot patterns, he recognized them from behavioural contexts: some hyenas had favourite places to lie down, some were very bold in front of people, some were excessively aggressive towards other hyenas. The poisoned hyena lying in the road was not in control of its actions; it was writhing and squealing and outside of its usual behavioural repertoire. As a consequence Yusuf simply assumed that it was one of his Sofi hyenas and took it to the feeding place beside his house. Moreover, Yusuf’s interpretation of the actions of the other Sofi hyenas was different from my own. He perceived that the hyenas were aggressive because they were concerned for the young hyena in human hands. As far as Yusuf was concerned, the Sofi hyenas took the young poisoned hyena away not to kill but to care for. This is why he had no compunction about handing over a poisoned hyena to an angry mob, who I anticipated would kill and eat it.</p>
<p>Lastly, it remains for me to explain the actions of the sheikh who stood over the hyena, reciting the Quran, and who did so until the Sofi hyenas finally took the unfortunate sub-adult away. In Harar, hyenas are ‘spiritually powerful’ animals. In the first place, hyenas are messengers. They are given instructions by the town’s Saints (deceased religious figures), who meet every Thursday on the mountain overlooking the town. The hyenas pass these messages on to certain people who can understand hyena language, and these people pass them on to sheikhs and elders. The messages contain advice about developments in the town, instructions for religious adherence, predictions of future occurrences or occasionally updates on the numbers of <italic>jinn</italic> in the town. Within Islam, <italic>jinn</italic> (sing. <italic>jinni</italic>) are unseen spirits who have the capacity to cause mischief or to possess people (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0539018413477521">Fadlalla, 2005</xref>). Some people in Harar are very concerned about the presence of <italic>jinn</italic> and as a consequence are very appreciative of the presence of hyenas. The reason is that hyenas can see <italic>jinn</italic>. Moreover, they catch and eat the unseen entities. Indeed it was intimated to me that the reason for the local term used to address hyenas ‘<italic>Derma sheikh</italic>’ or ‘Young man of religion’ is that hyenas have the capacity to control the numbers of <italic>jinn</italic>, as do the human sheikhs who are called upon to treat <italic>jinn</italic> possession. This is yet another reason for the persistence of hyenas in Harar: they protect the people from beings far more elusive and dangerous than themselves.</p>
<p>Having traced the threads of prehistory, history, biology, religion, economics, landscape and society, the events I described at the beginning of this article should make more sense. Hyenas persisted in Harar due to the circumstances of Ethiopia’s colonization from within. Furthermore, their ability to consume carrion, which evolved over millions of years in competition with humans, enabled them to persist where the deforested landscape precluded lions. The meat-rich diet of the local people combined with their heavy reliance upon, and prohibition against, consumption of donkeys ensured that there was ample carrion for the hyenas to eat. Despite hyenas occasionally preying on livestock and people, a combination of religious beliefs and social engagement with hyenas ensured that the people were never inclined towards eradicating their spotted neighbours; they appreciated the way in which hyenas controlled numbers of unseen spirits and they ascribed to hyenas a capacity for revenge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, global processes were bringing more and more tourists to Harar each year, and these people were attending the hyena-feeding places, which were in turn sanctioned by the government. At these places the close proximity of people and hyenas was emboldening the hyenas and inuring them to close proximity with people in the confines of the Old Town. The internally complex nature of the Old Town was in turn a result of socio-historical processes, which saw Harar surrounded by hostile neighbours so that it could only grow centripetally. This urban landscape constrained the territorial behaviours of the hyenas so that they were unable to establish, recognize or defend boundaries within the Old Town. Instead, they maintained a tradition of coming together outside the gate at Argobberi to enact their rivalries. This was acknowledged by the people, who vacated the open space in front of the gate when the hyenas went there to fight; again a reflection of the social engagement of hyenas and people in Harar.</p>
<p>The place outside the gate at Argobberi is a salient example of the multispecies commons: a zone of entanglement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018413477521">Ingold, 2007</xref>: 103) in which historical, political, economic, social and religious threads combine in what Ingold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018413477521">2007</xref>: 100) calls a meshwork; where species come together in ways that defy singular explanations and challenge disciplinary boundaries. It is little wonder that biologists focus on hyenas in national parks and reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0539018413477521">Holekamp &amp; Dloniak, 2010</xref>:191–193); the complexity of the multispecies commons is difficult to reduce and quantify. This kind of entanglement exposes the shortcomings of the disciplinary divisions that seek to study subjects in isolation. The biological sciences are ill equipped to deal with a place such as Argobberi because they operate under the assumption that there is a ‘real’ Hyena out there in the savannah whose ecology can be measured in terms of resources and observable, repeated behaviours. When singular animals adopt singular trajectories in such complex landscapes as Harar, their actions become problematic for those who seek to subsume their behaviours within species paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018413477521">Lestel, Brunois &amp; Gaunet, 2006</xref>: 171). Meanwhile the social sciences fall down because they maintain a distinction between humans as actors in places of shared social meanings and animals as commodities or resources which are thought about but not engaged with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0539018413477521">Noske, 1993</xref>: 185). The social sciences still perpetuate Mead’s distinction between the reflective, social humans and the instinctual animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018413477521">Alger &amp; Alger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0539018413477521">Myers, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>At Argobberi, the biological is the social is the historical is the ecological. A complex interweaving of processes combines to create a place in which resident hyenas’ normal means of maintaining territories are confounded. Thus the hyenas establish and maintain a socially constructed, politicized boundary, which they come to understand through participation in inter-clan disputes such as the one described above. Yet the maintenance of the territorial boundary is a joint effort by both hyenas and humans. The people at Argobberi had to vacate the place for the Sofi and Aboker hyenas to be able to enact their rivalries there. And they told stories of the territorial boundary. Those people shared with the hyenas the recognition that Argobberi was the place where clan rivalries were enacted and they participated in those rivalries by vacating the space and giving it over to the hyenas. The territorial boundary at Argobberi was a place of mutual co-shaping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0539018413477521">Fuentes, 2010</xref>) maintained by both humans and hyenas.</p>
<p>In many respects the commons at Argobberi is unexceptional. The hybrid community is the norm rather than the exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0539018413477521">Lestel, 2006</xref>: 150); the world is full of human and non-human actors coming together, ‘cooperating and struggling’ with wider social, political, historical, economic and social processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0539018413477521">Sanders &amp; Arluke, 1993</xref>: 386). Indeed Yusuf’s hyena-feeding place just down the road from Argobberi is another example; it is there that people and hyenas combine to shape each others’ actions in a feeding context. Yet, Argobberi is striking because it so explicitly confounds the distinctions between the social human and the ecological animal. This is the utility and wonder of the multispecies commons: it dramatically explodes social, political and historical relations, wrenches them away from the exclusively human realm and subsumes them under the overarching concept of ecological relations which include humans, non-humans and everything else besides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0539018413477521">Ingold, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0539018413477521">2000</xref>). This is not the ‘death of the social (in epistemological terms)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0539018413477521">Taylor, 2012</xref>: 44); rather, this is its expansion to encompass a wider world of actors. The multispecies commons challenges us to reconceptualize the ways in which human and non-human lives are lived; it speaks of meanings which transcend language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018413477521">Alger &amp; Alger, 2003</xref>: 76) and loudly demands that we reconfigure the paradigms that guide our understandings of what are social processes.</p>
<p>Lastly I want to return to that young hyena who lay down in the road in front of Argobberi. At some point during that night, the unfortunate hyena made a choice that had far-reaching ramifications. He chose a direction in which to look for food, and found some. Whether a poisoned rat or a baited piece of meat, the hyena ate the poison and then chose to go in the direction of Argobberi. By the time he arrived at the road, he must have been severely ill because that is as far as he could go. From that point, the solitary hyena became the central character in a play of events involving a crowd of onlookers, a sheikh, a hyena feeder and his family, an anthropologist, two hyena clans and now whoever reads this paper. It is the one consolation that I draw from having seen that hyena suffering; his body coiling as he writhed spasmodically and then flattening out as he tried to catch his breath before, inevitably, the next spasm came. I like to think that his wretched death was not meaningless. Rather than lying down in a ditch in the darkness and waiting for the vultures to find his carcass in the morning, he went to one of the most crowded places in Harar at that time of night. When he lay down on the road outside the gate at Argobberi, his actions brought together a tangle of threads which pulled and still pull at the foundations of so many different kinds of boundaries.</p>
