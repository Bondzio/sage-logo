<p>The author of this book is a well-known economist and an authority on industrial relations in India. His previous works concentrate on contemporary issues relating to his chosen fields. This probably is his first work where he dwells upon political developments as well, and that too in a historical context. One would have thought a book purporting to offer perspectives on politics and the economy should include ‘society’ too in its preview. For, social developments have a crucial bearing on politics and the economy and even on labour problems.</p>
<p>The exclusion is somewhat jarring, but this is a minor quibble. The planning of the book offers a major problem for the reviewer. For, the volume under review is only half the book, as it contains only four of the nine chapters planned; the other five will be in Volume 2 which, to the best of my knowledge, is yet to be published. The reviewer, thus, is in no position to know where the author is leading his readers or what his final conclusion or message will be, and judge his work against the backdrop of existing literature on the subject. Periodization of the two volumes poses another problem for the reviewer. The division of a relatively long time span into sub-periods is normally based on some landmarks associated with the subject matter. From this angle, the beginning of Volume 1 with 1918, which marked the emergence of Gandhi as a decisive voice in the freedom struggle, has a justifiable basis. But the choice of 1957 as the terminal point of the first volume is baffling indeed. The author has not explained his rationale, but by no stretch of imagination can the age of Gandhi be stretched beyond 1948. In fact in his preface the author himself states that the Gandhian era ended in 1947, when the ‘unGandhian’ Nehru era started.</p>
<p>The author also does not explain the purpose of writing this book. Reading through his preface, one gathers the impression that he felt that it was his ‘responsibility’ to ‘piece together a large body of works to present the complex nature of developments over nine decades in a connected, unbroken sequence … in a single narrative’. This he claims is the ‘first endeavour’ of its kind. Even if we accept the claim—although some recent works of Bipan Chand and his associates at the Jawaharlal Nehru University may question it—this can hardly be accepted as a proper justification for writing a book unless it is meant to be a textbook. No reader, however, can fail to be impressed by the wide readings that have gone into the making of this work. To the best of my understanding, no work of any consequence dealing with the period covered in the book has missed the author’s attention. However, what emerges from his effort is a mere rehash or digest of the existing works rather than an original, critical account throwing new light on the subject matter or offering new insights.</p>
<p>Asserting that he has followed ‘the method of history’, the author hastens to add that what he has produced is not ‘a work of history’. But he does not specify the discipline to which his work belongs. However, his account unquestionably unfolds what happened in India in relation to the three areas he has chosen to focus on. How the coming of Gandhi on the national plane transformed the political climate; how his leadership, coupled with the repressive policies of the alien government, gave a new momentum to the freedom movement; how the communal agenda vitiated the political atmosphere; how the World War II affected the Indian economy and business; and how the labour movement remained a handmaiden and convenient tool of the political parties—all this and related developments have been described in great detail. The author’s narrative, however deals with the three aspects he is concerned with as separate compartments and not as an integrated whole.</p>
<p>Such an approach cannot produce a good scholarly vehicle capable of offering new perspectives, which, the title suggests, is the purpose of this book. Perspective is not a factual account but the essence of understanding that an author derives from it and transmits to his readers to enrich their learning and incite their curiosity. One looks in vain for such a phenomenon in this volume. Unconventional usages and unintelligible language on occasions make the situation still worse. Examples: ‘India’s conflict systems have come out of the repressed mode and show little tendency to wane and weaken’ (p. XII); ‘The earlier announcement of the Labour government … was also politically repelled and undone’ (p. 216); ‘The intellectual basis for a life of sacrifice has been the entirely secular, Western doctrines or dogmas of Marxism, later interpreted as Leninism, Stalinism and Maoism with considerable variations in basic themes as well as points of emphasis’ (p. 403). These by no means exhaust the list.</p>
<p>I hope that the yet-to-be-published second volume will remove the grounds of some of my misgivings and reservations.</p>
