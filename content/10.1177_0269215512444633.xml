<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The terms ‘hippotherapy’ and ‘therapeutic horseback riding’ are used to describe treatment strategies that use the movement of the horse for improving postural control and/or balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512444633">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512444633">2</xref></sup> and general function or mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512444633">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512444633">3</xref></sup> Preliminary phase I research suggests that both hippotherapy and horseback riding therapy may be beneficial for patients with spinal cord injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512444633">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512444633">5</xref></sup> multiple sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512444633">6</xref></sup> or cerebral palsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512444633">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512444633">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512444633"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512444633"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512444633"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512444633"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512444633"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512444633"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512444633"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512444633"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512444633">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hippotherapy simulators that ‘imitate’ the movements of a horse are available to buy and, as a result, this therapy has become more accessible to patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512444633">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512444633"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512444633">19</xref></sup> However, the research evidence to support the use of this technology in routine care has been limited; only three papers were identified following a comprehensive literature search.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512444633">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512444633"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512444633">19</xref></sup> Quint and Toomey,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512444633">19</xref></sup> using a matched pair design and within pair randomization, suggested that treatment on a hippotherapy simulator can lead to improvement in static posture, however, they also noted that similar improvements were also seen on people who used a static saddle. Kuczyński and Słonka,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512444633">17</xref></sup> using a quasi-controlled study design, demonstrated that sagittal plane stability may have increased following three months of treatment using a hippotherapy simulator, however, they did not study as to whether the changes in sway resulted in an improvement in activity and/or participation. Zurek et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512444633">18</xref></sup> is not reviewed as the outcome measure (skin temperature of lower limbs) was not related to postural control or mobility.</p>
<p>The first review of horseback riding therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512444633">3</xref></sup> came to the conclusion that, although there is some evidence of benefit associated with horseback riding, rigorous studies with larger samples were needed to prove that this treatment worked. A more recent review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512444633">2</xref></sup> of all studies using hippotherapy, horseback riding therapy and hippotherapy simulators concludes that there may be some evidence for the use of these therapies in the rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy but the authors also acknowledge that more rigorous research is required to prove the clinical benefits associated with treatment. Two of the eight papers that met the inclusion criteria in the latter review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512444633">2</xref></sup> used a hippotherapy simulator;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512444633">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512444633">19</xref></sup> all other papers used traditional hippotherapy.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to quantify the therapeutic effects of hippotherapy simulators in the rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy using a protocol similar to those used in hippotherapy or horseback riding therapy studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512444633">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512444633">20</xref></sup> The specific objectives were to investigate whether hippotherapy (when applied by a simulator) may improve postural control and balance in children with cerebral palsy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269215512444633" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a single-blind stratified randomized control study with an independent assessor. The sampling frame was children between the ages of 4 and 18 years old with cerebral palsy (Gross Motor Function Classification System<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512444633">21</xref></sup> levels I–V) who attend schools run by the Department of Education of the Government of Aragon (Spain). The study was approved by the Spanish Regional Ethics Committee (CEICA) (reference number CP04/06/08). Informed consent was obtained from the legal representative of the child (parent or tutor for those under the care of state).</p>
<p>Participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512444633">22</xref></sup> were accepted to trial. Children who refused to participate or could not attend the sessions were not enrolled. Baseline measurements were taken in participants who were eligible to participate and for whom we had consent. After the baseline measurements were taken (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215512444633">Table 1</xref>), the participants were stratified based on the Gross Motor Function Classification System level and then randomized (using a concealed random allocation method) to one of two groups: an intervention group and a control group. In the intervention group, the 15-minute session (once a week for 10 weeks) consisted of sitting on the hippotherapy simulator with active extension of the trunk while the simulator was switched ON in the WORKOUT mode. In the control group, the 15-minute session (once a week for 10 weeks) consisted of sitting on the hippotherapy simulator with active extension of the trunk while the simulator was switched OFF. Therefore the children in the control group did not receive the rhythmic movement from the simulator (it was similar to sitting on a barrel or another device in which they maintained this sitting position as in other published studies).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512444633">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512444633">20</xref></sup> The children who consented, and for whom baseline measurements were taken, were considered as drop-outs if they did not attend the treatment sessions. Further details of the methods and the hippotherapy simulator are described by Herrero et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512444633">22</xref></sup></p>

<p>The measures for this study were gross motor function, measured with the Gross Motor Function Measure-66<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512444633">23</xref></sup> and sitting balance measured by the balance component of the Gross Motor Function Measure (dimension B) and the Sitting Assessment Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512444633">24</xref></sup> The assessors were trained to use the above measures in a consistent way. A questionnaire was completed at the beginning of the study to collect the sociodemographic variables previously described in the literature as potentially confounding. The baseline equivalence was tested using an appropriate statistical test (chi-squared test or the <italic>t</italic>-test) for each of outcome variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215512444633">Table 1</xref>) and the appropriate descriptive statistics are reported with <italic>P</italic>-values.</p>
<p>Using an intention-to-treat approach (with last value carried forward in case of missing data), effect size of treatment (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512444633">25</xref></sup> and odds ratios,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512444633">26</xref></sup> along with respective 95% confidence interval (CI), are reported. Data were initially analysed for the whole group. As stratification was done prior to randomization, the analysis was repeated for groups split on the Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I–V. The data were analysed for Total Gross Motor Function Measure scores, dimension B of Gross Motor Function Measure and the Sitting Assessment Scale.</p>

<p>After randomization, both groups were comparable at baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215512444633">Table 1</xref>). The sample was biased towards children with higher levels of disability; 19 children (50%) were classified as Gross Motor Function Classification System level V.</p>
<p>The Sitting Assessment Scale was a very insensitive measure. One child improved by one point, two children improved by two points and one child deteriorated by four points. Although we have presented the appropriate inferential statistics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215512444633">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215512444633">3</xref>, the results will not be presented or discussed further. The rest of the results will focus on the Gross Motor Function Measure only. For the subgroup analysis, data for Gross Motor Function Classification System level V is only presented because the subsamples of levels I–IV were too small to carry out a meaningful analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main findings from this study were that hippotherapy, when applied with a simulator (for 15 minutes once a week), in addition to routine therapy, helps improving sitting balance in children with cerebral palsy and that this effect is better in people with higher levels of disability. However, the improvements in sitting balance, as achieved in this study, may have a smaller effect on overall functional performance. The carry-over effects of treatment were maintained in people with higher levels of disability which would suggest that improvements in sitting balance are likely to have occurred as a result of motor learning associated with the dynamic nature of the repetitive task training that was given to the children (mechanical hippotherapy in conjunction with additional tasks that required balance control). The providing of additional support seems not to have prevented learning from taking place as the Gross Motor Function Measure measurements are a reflection of the child’s true capacity.</p>
<p>It is not possible to fully explain the smaller benefits seen in patients with higher levels of ability. It is possible that the duration of the sessions or the intensity of therapy (in terms of magnitude of displacement and velocity during the simulation and duration of the treatment) was insufficient for this patient group and hence the effects were smaller than expected for the participants who had a good level of ability. In this study we used a standardized therapy that all participants could engage with, as opposed to a customized therapy in future studies. There is a need to explore whether customized hippotherapy can lead to better outcomes for all participants. More modelling work (phase I) and phase II clinical trials are required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215512444633">27</xref></sup> to identify an optimal way of prescribing treatment with mechanical hippotherapy.</p>
<p>There were some limitations within the study. We did not customize the hippotherapy simulator treatment to the ability of the children and hence it is possible that not all patients benefited equally. Further, we did not measure the kinematics of the simulation and the response of the child (in terms of kinematics and muscle activation) hence we cannot fully explain the mechanism leading to improvements in balance. The duration of treatment was also limited to one 15-minute session per week (for a 10-week period). Apart from these limitations, there were limitations related to the sample: (1) sample was small and therefore a comparative analysis by Gross Motor Function Classification System levels could not be carried out; (2) the sample was biased towards the highest levels of disability (level V); (3) the study included children from a wide age group (4–18 years) and functional levels (Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I–V) on the assumption that all had the potential to benefit equally from the intervention.</p>
<p>This study has also some important strengths. One of them is that this is the first study analysing the effect of hippotherapy simulators in posture control and gross motor function in cerebral palsy children with standardized measurements, while other studies carried out with mechanical hippotherapy simulators did not use standardized measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512444633">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512444633">19</xref></sup> Besides, this study is a randomized controlled trial, including a control group and a larger sample of cerebral palsy children than most of the previous studies (except for Davi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215512444633">28</xref></sup>) regarding not only hippotherapy simulator studies, but also traditional hippotherapy or horseback riding therapy ones. This makes this article valuable as a starting point for studying the therapeutic effects of hippotherapy simulators in the treatment of cerebral palsy children. However more work is needed to identify how this therapy can be adapted for use in all patients with cerebral palsy. A significant body of research is needed to address these issues.</p>
<p>Although our study has focused on hippotherapy simulators, when we had to design the study, we reviewed literature related to hippotherapy simulators but also traditional hippotherapy. Regarding previous hippotherapy simulator research, our treatment protocol was similar to those used by Kuczyński et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512444633">17</xref></sup> (20 minutes microprocessor-controlled saddle riding, performed twice a week for three months) and Quint et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512444633">19</xref></sup> (sitting on a mechanical saddle 10 sessions of 10 minutes for four weeks). Our study was consistent with the results of Kuczyński et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512444633">17</xref></sup> which showed that the therapy led to a noteworthy improvement in the postural performance of the cerebral palsy children in sagittal as well in frontal planes, although they did not use standardized measurements. Quint et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512444633">19</xref></sup> only measured pelvic mobility and not postural control or balance so comparison of results is not possible.</p>
<p>With regard to traditional hippotherapy or horseback riding therapy it is difficult to compare our results with the studies carried out because: (1) most of the studies were based on extremely small sample sizes of children; (2) many of these studies did not include a control group; (3) the length and duration of the programmes varied greatly. Some studies on traditional hippotherapy or horseback riding therapy have not found a therapeutical effect on Gross Motor Function Measure in cerebral palsy children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215512444633">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215512444633"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215512444633">30</xref></sup> while others have shown therapeutical effects in all the Total Gross Motor Function Scores except dimension A,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215512444633">31</xref></sup> in only dimension E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512444633">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215512444633">32</xref></sup> or in the total score and dimension E.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512444633">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215512444633">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In relation with our work, we think that three studies should be highlighted. The first, carried out by Sterba et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512444633">10</xref></sup> because it suggests that significant changes could have been obtained in dimension B of the Gross Motor Function Measure if the sample had been larger. A second study, carried out by Hamill et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215512444633">30</xref></sup> used the same outcome measurements as us but did not show significant differences on Gross Motor Function Measure and Sitting Assessment Scale after a 10-week hippotherapy programme in three children with Gross Motor Function Classification System level V. The third one, a review carried out by Whalen and Case-Smith,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512444633">1</xref></sup> concluded that: (1) it cannot be determined as to whether or not riding twice per week produced a larger effect, but the evidence suggests that riding once per week is sufficient to achieve significant improvements in gross motor function and mobility; (2) it appears that a minimum of 8–10 weeks may be necessary to achieve positive effects and that longer interventions are more likely to yield improvements in gross motor function.</p>
<p>At present, there are no studies comparing the therapeutical effects of hippotherapy simulators with traditional hippotherapy.</p>
<p>From a clinical point of view, we think that a few aspects can be extrapolated from this research. On the one hand, from a mechanical point of view, the foundations of the use of this kind of therapy are reasonable, as it is directly related to postural control and balance in the sitting position. On the other hand, although the use of hippotherapy simulators is controversial for some therapists because it is said that it only imitates the mechanical pattern of movement and loses all the psychological aspects related to traditional hippotherapy, we consider that this therapy can be very worthy in a clinical setting because a simulator has a low cost when compared with live horses (maintenance of animals, facilities and cost of insurance), it is safer than live horses for the users, more accessible to ride on it for children with restricted mobility and its use does not depend on environmental conditions. Besides, this technology can be easily installed in a clinical setting and it can be combined with physiotherapy-related activities and/or other technology (such as wii games) to make rehabilitation more fun and attractive for children, enhancing the motivational part of the therapy.</p>
