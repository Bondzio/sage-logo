<abstract>
<p>The present study examined the effects of perpetrator sex category, victim confrontation, observer sex category, and observer attitudes on attributions of blame and behavioral stability for partner violence. Data were collected from 728 college-aged students enrolled at 2 universities in the United States. Results demonstrated that males and females attributed less blame and behavioral stability to female perpetrators than male perpetrators, especially if the perpetrator was provoked. Moreover, attitudes toward women and violence were important for predicting attributions, and some of the evidence for observer effects was reduced to nonsignificance once these variables were added to the model.</p>

<p>More than 200 surveys of the general population demonstrate that the most commonly occurring pattern of intimate partner violence (IPV) is bidirectional violence or mutual battering (for meta-analytic reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512447571">Archer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512447571">Fiebert, 2004</xref>) with females’ use of minor violence against males viewed as more acceptable than male’s use of minor violence against females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512447571">Douglas &amp; Straus, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512447571">Straus, 2009</xref>). Research shows that observers attribute blame for violent acts differently based on perpetrator sex category, victim confrontation, severity of the assault, and various observer characteristics. Thus, it is essential to explain the processes by which causal attributions for IPV are formed as there are implications for intervention, at both the individual and system level.</p>
<p>Attribution theory is used to understand how people form explanations for social psychological phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512447571">Heider, 1958</xref>). With regard to IPV, attribution theory has been used to examine causal attributions for violent behavior. In such studies, the violent act is explicit and attributions of blame for the violent act are examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512447571">Shaver &amp; Drown, 1986</xref>). Less often examined in the IPV literature are attributions of behavioral stability, which examine if the violent act is perceived as situational or consistent. Foundational work in attribution theory demonstrates that attributions made about others’ traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512447571">Heider, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512447571">Mischel, 1968</xref>) and negative behaviors are considered stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512447571">Furnham &amp; Endler, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512447571">Jones &amp; McGillis, 1965</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512447571">Argyle, Furnham, and Graham (1981)</xref> argued that attributions of behavioral stability aid in predicting patterns of social behavior and such attributions could affect IPV victims’ decisions to flee abusive relationships or jurors’ decisions in IPV cases at the punishment phase.</p>
<p>The general public views females as less violent than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512447571">Straus, 2009</xref>) and that bias may influence attributions of culpability for females’ violent behaviors. Presumably, participants unintentionally ascribe sex-based traits to perpetrators and rely on those traits to comprehend violent acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260512447571">Winter &amp; Uleman, 1984</xref>). In studies that have manipulated perpetrator sex category and attributions of blame, research shows that females are attributed less blame than males for similar violent acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512447571">Bryant &amp; Spencer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512447571">Cook &amp; Harris, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512447571">Esqueda &amp; Harrison, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512447571">Sorenson &amp; Taylor, 2005</xref>) and victim confrontation yields more lenient punishment recommendations in the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512447571">Bradbury &amp; Fincham, 1990</xref>). Taken together, females confronted by males are attributed the least amount of blame in comparison to females who were not confronted, or males who were confronted, and males not confronted by their female victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512447571">Rhatigan, Stewart, &amp; Moore, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512447571">Sorenson &amp; Taylor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512447571">Witte, Schroeder, &amp; Lohr, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Culpability is influenced not only by perpetrator sex category but also by observer sex category, as males blame victims of IPV more than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512447571">Bryant &amp; Spencer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512447571">Lange &amp; Knowles, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512447571">Nayak, Byrne, Martin, &amp; Abraham, 2003</xref>) and hold males less accountable for violent acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512447571">Bryant &amp; Spencer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512447571">Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Shlien-Dellinger, Huss, &amp; Kramer, 2004</xref>; Pierce &amp; Harris, 1993), whereas females attribute more blame to male perpetrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512447571">Bryant &amp; Spencer, 2003</xref>; Hamby &amp; Jackson, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512447571">Lange &amp; Knowles, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512447571">Kanekar, Pinto, &amp; Mazumdar, 1985</xref>) and view violence as more deleterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512447571">Koski &amp; Manigold, 1988</xref>). Males are also more likely to attribute males’ violence to external/situational factors and attribute females’ violence to internal traits such as personality characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512447571">Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512447571">Stamp &amp; Sabourin, 1995</xref>). However, sex differences are found to be unreliable in some research areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512447571">Unger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260512447571">Yoder &amp; Kahn, 2003</xref>) and reported sex differences could be conflated with other variables such as gender-related attitudes.</p>
<p>Typically, males hold more negative views of females than do females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512447571">Finn, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512447571">Kristiansen &amp; Guilietti, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512447571">Spence, Helmreich, &amp; Stapp, 1973</xref>), and such males blame female victims and hold male perpetrators less accountable for their violent behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512447571">Hiller &amp; Foddy, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512447571">Howard, 1984a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512447571">1984b</xref>). Moreover, males with traditional attitudes toward females and greater acceptance of violence are more likely to attribute blame to female rape victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512447571">Caron &amp; Carter, 1997</xref>) and have more positive perceptions of perpetrators of wife assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512447571">Sugarman &amp; Frankel, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study extends previous research by examining perpetrator sex category differences in attributions of blame and behavioral stability for IPV. The study used a quasi-experimental paradigm wherein hypothetical scenarios varied randomly by perpetrator sex category and confrontation level. Attitudes toward violence and women were examined for observer sex category differences. Based on previous research it was predicted that (a) male observers would attribute less blame and behavioral stability to male perpetrators who were confronted by their victims, (b) male observers with traditional views of females would attribute less blame and less behavioral stability to perpetrators than males with egalitarian attitudes toward females or female observers, and (c) male observers with accepting attitudes toward violence and traditional views of females would attribute less blame and less behavioral stability to male perpetrators than other observers.</p>

<sec id="section2-0886260512447571">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 728 undergraduate students (449 female and 279 males) enrolled in psychology courses at one of two large, public, U.S., southern universities participated in this study for partial course credit or extra credit. Approval to conduct this research was granted by the institutional review boards at both institutions.</p>
<p>Demographic data showed that participants’ mean age was 20.3 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.4; range = 17-29) and that 54% were freshmen, 25% were sophomores, 14% were juniors, and 7% were seniors. Six ethnic groups were represented in the total sample: 55.6% were European American, 22.4% were Hispanic, 13.9% were African American, 2.7% were Asian American, 1.9% were Middle Eastern, 0.3% were Native American, and 3.0% were Other. Participants reflected the overall population of their respective universities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886260512447571">
<title>Design and Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were randomly assigned to the female or male perpetrator and confrontation or no confrontation conditions and were directly assigned to the observer condition based on their sex category (female or male). Once the purpose of the study and general procedures were described and consent for participation was obtained, participants completed a demographics questionnaire, read one of the 4 randomly assigned vignettes that depicted conflict between male and female dating partners, and completed a series of other measures. Instructions were standardized and presentation of materials and order of the surveys remained consistent across data-collection sites.</p>

<title>Hypothetical vignettes</title>
<p>Four vignettes were constructed varying the sex category of the perpetrator (male or female perpetrator) and the level of confrontation (verbal confrontation or no confrontation) between male and female dating partners (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512447571">Table 1</xref>). Initial pilot work demonstrated that confrontation scenes were perceived as more “provocative” than the nonconfrontational scenes, <italic>F</italic>(3, 153) = 16.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, with no differences for male and female perpetrators. In addition, there were no differences reported in terms of realism, <italic>F</italic>(3, 153) = 0.89, <italic>p</italic> = .45.</p>

<p>To assess attributions of causality, responsibility, and blame an 11-item measure based on well-established, relationship-related attribution measure (RAM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512447571">Fincham &amp; Bradbury, 1992</xref>) and the theoretical notions distinguishing between causal, responsibility, and blaming attributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512447571">Shaver &amp; Drown, 1986</xref>) was constructed.

A principal components analysis with Varimax rotation was performed on the scale, and it yielded a two-factor solution. The first factor included five items that assessed blame and cause for the violent act, and the second factor included four items that examined behavioral stability.

<p>The Attitudes Toward Women–Short Version (AWS–Short version; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512447571">Spence et al., 1973</xref>) was used to measure the extent to which individuals espouse either egalitarian or traditional views of women’s behavior in the workplace and at home; the short and long versions of the survey are almost perfectly correlated, <italic>r</italic> = .96 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512447571">Spence et al., 1973</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512447571">Daugherty and Dambrot (1986)</xref> assessed the reliability of the AWS scale; Cronbach’s alpha was .89 and the Spearman split-half reliability was .86. Cronbach’s alpha was .84 in our sample. Example items include the following: “The intellectual leadership of a community should be largely in the hands of men” and “A woman should be as free as a man to propose marriage.” Each item is accompanied by a 4-point response scale ranging from <italic>agree strongly</italic> to <italic>disagree strongly</italic>. Items are scored from 0 to 3; high scores indicate an egalitarian attitude.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Prior to conducting data analyses, patterns of missing data were explored using a linear interpolation method for imputing data for participants who completed at least 70% of items on the respective measures (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512447571">Franke, 1982</xref>). Using this imputation method did not significantly change the results of the study, so we used the complete data set in all analyses.</p>
<p>To examine how men and women attribute blame and behavioral stability to violent perpetrators who were confronted by their victims, a factorial multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed. The three-way interaction was not significant, but the interactions between perpetrator sex category and confrontation level, Λ = .98, <italic>F</italic>(2, 692) = 5.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> = .017, and perpetrator and observer sex category were significant, Λ = .99, <italic>F</italic>(2, 692) = 5.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> = .015. Multivariate main effects were found for perpetrator sex category, Λ = .86, <italic>F</italic>(2, 692) = 55.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> = .139, confrontation level, Λ = .86, <italic>F</italic>(2, 692) = 56.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> = .140, and observer sex category, Λ = .99, <italic>F</italic>(2, 692) = 4.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> = .013.

<p>Planned post hoc analyses demonstrated that women viewed female perpetrators’ violence as less stable than male perpetrators’ violence. Furthermore, male perpetrators who were not confronted by their victims were attributed more blame than were males who were confronted by their victims or female perpetrators. In addition, observers attributed more blame to male and female perpetrators as well as viewed violence as more stable in nonconfrontational scenarios. Male perpetrators were attributed more blame and viewed as engaging in more stable acts of violence than were female perpetrators, and females attributed more blame to violent perpetrators (male or female) than did males.</p>
<p>It was expected that attitudes toward women would influence attributions of blame and behavioral stability, and thus a factorial multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was conducted, while holding significant interactions and main effects from the previous analysis constant. Results yielded a significant two-way multivariate interaction between observer sex category and attitudes toward women, Λ = .85, <italic>F</italic>(74, 1114) = 1.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> = .079, and significant multivariate main effects for attitudes toward women, Λ = .78, <italic>F</italic>(90, 1114) = 1.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> = .116, and the covariates confrontation by perpetrator sex category, perpetrator by observer sex category, and confrontation, Λ = .97, <italic>F</italic>(2, 557) = 7.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> = .026, Λ = .99, <italic>F</italic>(2, 557) = 3.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> = .014, Λ = .97, <italic>F</italic>(2, 557) = 8.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> = .028, respectively.</p>
<p>Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) revealed that males with traditional views of women attributed less behavioral stability to violent male and female perpetrators. In addition, observers with traditional attitudes toward women attributed less blame and behavioral stability to violent perpetrators than did participants with egalitarian views of women. Moreover, females attributed greater behavioral stability to male perpetrators, and observers (females and males) attributed less blame when the victim was confrontational.</p>
<p>It was also predicted that males with greater acceptance of violence and traditional views of women would lead to lesser assignment of blame and behavioral stability to male perpetrators. A factorial MANCOVA yielded significant multivariate three-way interactions between attitudes toward violence, attitudes toward women, and observer sex category, Λ <italic>=</italic> .81, <italic>F</italic>(182, 330) = 1.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> <italic>=</italic> .438, and attitudes toward violence, attitudes toward women, and perpetrator sex category, Λ = .36, <italic>F</italic>(414, 330) = 1.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> <italic>=</italic> .400. The two-way multivariate interaction was significant for attitudes toward women by attitudes toward violence, Λ = .60, <italic>F</italic>(167, 330) = 1.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> <italic>=</italic> .162, as were the covariate effects for perpetrator sex category and confrontation level, Λ = .80, <italic>F</italic>(2, 165) = 21.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> = .205, Λ = .81, <italic>F</italic>(2, 165) = 19.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, η<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup> = .192, respectively.</p>
<p>Planned post hoc analyses revealed that men with accepting attitudes toward violence and traditional views of women viewed violent acts as unstable and men and women with traditional views of women and greater acceptance of violence blamed female perpetrators more than male perpetrators for similar acts of violence. Moreover, observers with egalitarian attitudes toward women and who were less accepting of violence viewed violence as more unstable.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of theoretically derived predictors of blame and behavioral stability attributions for male and female perpetrated IPV. Much like previous research, which asserts that attributions are multidimensional (e.g., internal/external, temporary/stable, positive/negative), we found that attributions of blame and behavioral stability are separate constructs when evaluating violent acts and particular information is central in making such attributions.</p>
<p>There were clear and consistent differences in attributions of blame and behavioral stability for male- and female-perpetrated violence among our participants, with male perpetrators attributed more blame and behavioral stability. Not surprisingly, these data are consistent with past research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512447571">Ferguson &amp; Negy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512447571">Sorenson &amp; Taylor, 2005</xref>) and suggest that most participants differentially respond to a male’s use of violence. Consistent with gendered views of violent behavior, males are often viewed as aggressors in IPV, and thus males and females may attribute males’ behaviors to dispositional traits rather than situational factors. Conversely, people may assume that violent acts are out of character for females and must be explained by other situational variables such as self-defensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512447571">Saunders, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on the consequences of violence suggest that males’ violence tends to be perceived as more harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512447571">Stith, Smith, Penn, Ward, &amp; Tritt, 2004</xref>) with females incurring more injuries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512447571">Archer, 2000</xref>). Thus, the public may be fairly accurate in their reasons for differentially perceiving males’ and females’ violence. It remains to be seen whether the impact of violence on the victim ought to be considered in the determination of culpability, though current data suggest that it often is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512447571">Sorenson &amp; Taylor, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond the impact of violence, people may also believe that males and females possess different motivations for violence, with males using violence to control and females using violence to self-protect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512447571">Felson &amp; Messner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512447571">Saunders, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512447571">Stuart et al., 2006</xref>). Different motivations are likely to contribute to the public’s assessment of blame and whether a perpetrator’s violence is unremitting. Future studies might consider examining other contextual factors such as perpetrator motivation for violence and/or the impact of the violence (e.g., fear or injury) as additional predictors of attributions for violent events.</p>
<p>Increased attributions of blame for male perpetrators were compounded when they were not confronted by their female victims. Overall, participants attributed less blame and behavioral stability to cases of violence involving victim confrontation as compared to those involving no confrontation. These findings are consistent with past research showing that people, in general, believe that provocative victims should be held partially to blame for their attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512447571">Sorenson &amp; Taylor, 2005</xref>) and perpetrators’ use of violence against confrontational victims should be shown greater leniency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512447571">Bradbury &amp; Fincham, 1990</xref>). Situational variables seem to be important contextual factors influencing fault and behavioral stability attributions as demonstrated in studies examining other situational characteristics, such as victim alcohol consumption or infidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512447571">Sorenson &amp; Taylor, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Males and females differ in their attributions for violent acts and those differences may best be understood in terms of gender-related attitudes. Males who are more accepting of violence and hold traditional attitudes of women attribute less behavioral stability to violent perpetrators. In addition, participants who have traditional views of women and are more accepting of violence attribute more blame to female perpetrators, a finding consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512447571">Howard (1984a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512447571">1984b</xref>). Traditionalists view the normal female as “weak,” and thus females are at a double disadvantage when they fail to conform to stereotypes by either being a confrontational victim or an aggressor (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512447571">Mugford, 1989</xref>). In fact, males and females with traditional attitudes toward women attribute less blame for violent acts and view violence as more situational than do those with egalitarian views of women. Furthermore, males and females who are more accepting of violence view violent behavior as less stable.</p>
<p>Strengths and limitations of the present study should be noted. The lack of institutional differences increases generalizability. However, we collected data from a convenient sample of college students, and thus our findings may not necessarily generalize to a community or national sample of males and females. Though, in this regard, our findings are consistent with a study that used a large community sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512447571">Sorenson &amp; Taylor, 2005</xref>). As for limitations, our study employed the use of one vignette rather than multiple scenes and did not assess attributions regarding severe forms of violence, particularly those using a weapon. It may be that in cases where females have access to and use a weapon, such as a gun, all biases disappear since presumably size and strength in such circumstances should not matter (see as example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512447571">Sorenson &amp; Taylor, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0886260512447571" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Implications and Conclusions</title>
<p>The public is more accepting of a female’s use of force against a male intimate partner relative to a male’s use of force against a female intimate partner. In many ways, intolerant responses to males’ violence may be beneficial to society as this suggests that IPV is no longer seen as a “private family matter.” In contrast, however, societal tolerance of females’ violence may possibly be problematic in that it may partially explain current prevalence rates of mutual IPV (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512447571">Archer, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Others might rationalize that the prevalence rates are a function of males’ violence against females and females’ needs to defend themselves against their violent attackers. From this point of view, unlike males, females’ use of force is situational and not dispositional. Although females are increasingly being arrested and adjudicated for IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512447571">Hamberger &amp; Potente, 1994</xref>), convicted females’ overwhelming reported use of violence in self-defense (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512447571">DeKeseredy, Saunders, Schwartz, &amp; Alvi, 1997</xref>) provides further support to the notion that violent females are less likely to be repeat offenders and thus not deserving of severe sentences. However, when females fail to conform to stereotypes held by those with traditional views of women, they may be likely to be penalized for violation of gender norms, such as in the case of victim confrontation, where blame and behavioral stability are defused across the perpetrator and victim. For these reasons, the problem of females’ violence needs to be considered, evaluated, and better understood.</p>
