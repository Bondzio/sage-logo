<abstract>
<p>Despite unremitting, decades-long attempts to present the narrative and history of the Palestinian struggle as Israel, the US and western powers would have us see it, there has been a persistent and enduring counter-view, backed by meticulous academic research, political and personal involvement, direct experience, campaigning and historical analysis, that continues to be expressed from myriad perspectives and in myriad ways. Some of the most significant of these recent works, on Hamas, the PLO, Palestinian prisoners in Israel, US/Palestine negotiations, and the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaign, are examined in depth here. Their authors include Shafiq al-Hout, Sara Roy, Omar Barghouti, Beverley Milton-Edwards and Stephen Farrell, Abeer Baker and Anat Matar, and Clayton Swisher. Taken together, these works provide an effective antidote to the propaganda on the conflict.</p>

<p>Shafiq al-Hout’s personal memoir of his many years as a high official in the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) gives an essential background to all the other books discussed here. Al-Hout, who died in 2009, was one of the PLO’s leading figures from its formation, through the years as its representative during grim times in Lebanon’s camps, marked by the Sabra and Shatila massacres, and the rise of competing factions, until his resignation in 1993 after the Oslo Accords. Oslo, to him, was ‘a trap’ into which the Palestinian leadership fell and from which defeat stared out at him in ‘the intellectual and political heresies which came after it, and the decline in our goals and values’. The contrast between the Palestinian situation in the 1990s and what he had lived through in the 1960s and 1970s, in the heyday of national liberation movements, plunged him into despair.</p>
<p>The story of Israeli, US and Palestinian negotiations between 1990 and 2010, revealed in <italic>The Palestine Papers</italic>, exposed by Al Jazeera in early 2011, is a catalogue of ‘persistent dishonesty on the part of the US and its European allies’, as Dr Gharda Karmi puts it in her introduction to this important record, which traces the long road of escalating Israeli demands, and increasing Palestinian concessions, that followed Oslo.</p>
<p>But al-Hout was not to know all that, and, in July 2006, just as he felt paralysed by sadness, writing the last chapter of <italic>My Life in the PLO</italic>, his mood changed. Old hopes came back: ‘The men of Hizbullah pulled me out of the abyss, with their stunning victory over Israel. Their dream conquered my nightmare. The promise was renewed that Palestine would return to us and that we would return to it.’</p>
<p>Two months before, al-Hout had seen the reopening of the PLO office in Lebanon, under Abbas Zaki, an old-guard Fatah colleague who had spent years as the PLO representative in the Popular Democratic Republic of Yemen. The office in Beirut had been closed since 1982, a symbol of Palestinian defeats. That day, in al-Hout’s last political speech of his life, he warned his successor to ‘balance three spheres’, to: seek unity in the Palestinian sphere; moderation in the Lebanese sphere, so that rival Lebanese political factions would not use Palestinians as proxies; and, above all, cultivate the Arab sphere, especially Syria, as key to the Palestinian cause. In fact, as most of the new books referred to here spell out, none of these hopes ever stood a chance in the <italic>réal politique</italic> of Palestine in the early twenty-first century.</p>
<p>Al-Hout was an independent man, a journalist all his life, with an influential career stemming from his pen – one of the reasons he suffered no less than ten attempts on his life. His writing here brings to life scene after dramatic scene from his participation as an official in a long-lost Middle East world. He writes from what he knew beneath the surface, of Palestinian tensions with Nasser and with Jordan, then the death of Nasser and the end of the pan-Arab era; the PLO migrating to Lebanon; the taboo subjects of the lack of Palestinian unity; the broken trust with Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. The saddest parts of the book detail deteriorating relations with Yasser Arafat, as negotiators, such as he and the revered, late Haider Abdel Shafi, began to realise they were being sidelined. Al-Hout quotes Mahmoud Darwish as once saying harshly to him, ‘Abu Hader, this is a revolution tailored to Abu Ammar’s [Arafat’s] requirements, and you either have to accept the status quo or quit.’ It took until 1993 for him to do so.</p>
<p>By then, the rise of the five-year-old Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, was becoming the new and dominant factor in the Palestinian situation, and the unity that al-Hout had dreamed of had become illusory. Sara Roy has chosen to write about Hamas from the wholly original perspective of the organisation’s relations with civil society in Gaza. What she has found is a profound challenge to the very basis of US and European policy towards political Islam in Palestine and will be warmly welcomed by the many officials and scholars who have tried in vain to deflect the juggernaut of western policy, which has driven the region into the militarised cul de sac that is Israel today. (Roy quotes, for instance, the former UN Middle East envoy Manuel de Soto, in 2007, on how ‘the US clearly pushed for a confrontation between Fatah and Hamas’, while, in the same period, this US policy devised by Elliot Abrams and General Keith Dayton, and approved by Condoleezza Rice, was criticised by the Pentagon, the CIA and the US embassy in Israel, but implemented nonetheless.)</p>
<p>This is an academic’s book, not a journalist’s, and reflects the weight of the twenty-five years Roy has devoted to research on the Occupied Palestine Territories. Her book is drawn from extensive fieldwork, mainly in Gaza, but also in the West Bank. Its scope is from late 1993 and the signing of the Oslo Accord, through the years of Hamas’s entry into politics with an unexpected electoral victory, only to find itself running a Gaza dramatically severed from the West Bank, subjected to a US-run attempted coup in favour of its rival Fatah, an Israeli economic blockade and the assault of Israel’s Cast Lead operations from December 2008 to January 2009, in which 1,417 Palestinians were killed, including 313 children, in three weeks.</p>
<p>The roots of this political power lie back in the Hamas that was created from the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine in the first intifada (1987–1993). Roy sees the intifada years as critical to the movement’s development because they ‘localised and consolidated Hamas’s control over the Islamic social sector and provided the foundation for the emergence of new social institutions which the Islamists were better positioned, and in some cases uniquely poised, to support’.</p>
<p>Post-Oslo, Roy believes, was therefore the crucial period when Hamas was defined as a political and social organisation, and it demonstrated ‘its capacity for moderation, accommodation, and transformation’. In a typically sharp insight, she notes the focus on working with youth in community development with a religious and cultural framework and saw how ‘a sense of personal identification emerged from civic work and community involvement’. She contrasts this with the Palestinian Authority, which absorbed young men into the security apparatus as a source of employment and identity.</p>
<p>In those years, the mid-1990s, Hamas expanded the role of Islamic Associations in Gaza and the West Bank and made the social sphere the base for its political legitimacy. This was the key period of much of Roy’s research, and, as she writes, it was a ‘unique period of time in which critical and dramatic changes were occurring within the movement overall and within Hamas specifically’. The relative openness of that period (together with her introduction to the Hamas leadership by the late Haider Abdel Shafi, a Palestinian leader respected by everyone) gave her very unusual access for an outsider.</p>
<p>Hamas’s concrete organising achievements in providing clinics, kindergartens, schools, sports, arts and holiday programmes are well known to all visitors to Gaza, but Roy writes, too, on how the recipients feel about them and how they interact with their leaders. A picture emerges in which ‘Hamas institutions’ were not necessarily under the firm hand of Hamas, with a recruitment agenda, as is generally believed.</p>
<p>Roy also gives glimpses into the hidden world of the dozens of volunteer women involved in women’s empowerment programmes, of Hamas’s ability to play a mediating role in social disputes and of its initiatives, such as caring for the families of collaborators and reinserting them into the society, which traditionally had shunned them: ‘Islamic institutions provided islands of normality and stability in a socio-political context of chaos, dislocation, and pain … creating, in effect, a cultural private sector that felt familiar and safe to Palestinians in an otherwise rapidly evolving, confusing, and oppressive environment.’</p>
<p>The existence of any such comfort zone would be inconceivable to the US federal prosecutors who, in November 2008, won convictions against the Texas-based charity, Holy Land Foundation (HLF), accused of funnelling millions of dollars to Hamas. The HLF had sent $12.4 million to programmes for orphans and other community welfare groups – run by Hamas. None of the men involved with the HLF (two of whom, Shukri Abu Baker and Ghassan Elashi, were sentenced to US prison sentences of sixty-five years) were accused of directly financing terrorism, merely of supporting charitable activities run by a ‘designated terrorist group’. As Roy comments on this and other such cases, ‘the equation of Islamist social institutions with violence … a guise for promoting terrorism … remains deeply embedded and uncritically embraced at many levels of US society including the Supreme Court’.</p>
<p>The book darkens from 2006, after the US-led rejection of Hamas’s election success, followed by the growing catastrophe for Gaza of the impact of the US policy of arming Fatah. As the near-civil war erupted in Gaza, a US official’s words, spoken twice and quoted by de Soto, ‘I like this violence’, sum up what faced Hamas.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the siege of Gaza and the devastation of the economy, Hamas’s social institutions were systematically deprived of funding by international donors, and dozens were closed by Israel or the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. ‘The use of civic institutions as a political battleground points to the inability of Hamas to provide social services as it once did’, Roy notes. She writes, too, of how the myriad economic and military pressures have brought tension between the military and political wings (as well as growing divisions within each of those wings), turf wars over the informal business sector and a resumption of clan fighting. This erosion of Hamas’s social power was, of course, the objective of its powerful enemies.</p>
<p>At her most trenchant, Roy observes of Israel’s 2008 attack on Gaza that it was partly ‘about pacification and sending a clear message to Palestinians in the West Bank that says Israel will not withdraw from settlements or return any lands already taken’. She notes, too, that it came just as Hamas’s leadership in both Damascus and Gaza indicated that they were seeking a settlement along the 1967 borders. Sara Roy’s book deserves to be a small bombshell in the assumptions about Hamas that have come to govern US policy at home and in the Middle East, and are constantly reinforced by the western media.</p>
<p><italic>Hamas</italic>, Beverley Milton-Edwards and Stephen Farrell’s rich history, is based on decades of research and interviews, and tells its complex story with both verve and authority. This is another indispensable book for anyone who wants to understand a movement generally obscured by clichés and relentless misinformation. Unfortunately, however, there is a good deal of repetition and confusing, jumping timelines in the way the book is organised, which is partly thematic rather than using a straightforward chronology. The authors have had access to Hamas members from leadership level to grassroots commanders and civilians, but they are by no means uncritical and have also interviewed across the board, including Israeli officials, among Hamas’s most dedicated enemies.</p>
<p>Few saw Hamas’s importance coming, as Dr Abdel Shafi told the authors in 1989: ‘None of the political organisations paid it any attention. It was apolitical and not perceived as a threat.’ Israel, too, initially saw Hamas as a useful antidote to the secular nationalists of the PLO.</p>
<p>Hamas’s early leaders emerge here fleshed out as rounded characters. There is: Sheikh Salah Shehade, Egyptian-educated, social science graduate and the first leader of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades; and Yahya Ayyash, from the West Bank, graduate in electrical engineering and famous bomb-maker for the first Hamas suicide missions against Israel in 1994 and 1996, idolised by Gazan children ‘with the same fervour that Western youngsters revere sports stars such as David Beckham’. Both of them were assassinated by the Israelis: Shehade, in July 2002, by a one-tonne bomb on an apartment building, which killed more than a dozen people, including his wife, other women and several children; and Ayyash (nicknamed ‘the engineer’) by a booby-trapped mobile phone. In both cases, the Israelis succeeded because of collaborators – one of the movement’s constant threats.</p>
<p>The book quotes Knel Deeb, a Dubliner who was visiting his Palestinian cousins at the time of Shehade’s death and who ran to the scene:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>pieces of flesh were everywhere, one man running away holding a lump of flesh on a metal tray and another pulling out a baby boy with half his face blown away, obviously dead. Everyone was screaming, shouting, crying and shouting ‘Revenge to the Israeli child-killers’ … I just kept thinking: if the British army wanted to take out Gerry Adams, would they use a bomb that size in a residential area like this?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Such a reflection, on the response of colonial powers to the parallel aims of resistance movements, was never made in political circles. One year later, Abu Shanab, a leading member of Hamas’s Political Bureau, was incinerated by five rockets fired into his car; two years later, Hamas’s leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was killed in his wheelchair in Gaza City by Israeli helicopter gunships; and, one month later, his successor Dr Abdel Aziz Rantissi was also assassinated. Hamas’s leadership then went into hiding and it was some time before the new leader became known: Khaled Meshaal, exiled in Damascus.</p>
<p>In this book, at the heart of Hamas’s growing influence was its stand against Oslo’s failure to address the three key issues: settlement growth, Jerusalem and the refugees. In addition, the modest living of its leaders stood in sharp contrast to many Fatah leaders. Hamas was aided, too, by the perception that Ariel Sharon’s withdrawal of settlers from Gaza was a sign of Israeli weakness in the movement’s stronghold of resistance. All these factors placed Hamas in the unexpected position of winning the 2006 parliamentary elections, as Palestinians voted against Fatah’s failures.</p>
<p>The whole terrible story is told – of the aftermath of the western powers’ wholesale rejection of the election result, how Gaza became a prison and the killing of yet two more senior Hamas leaders, Sheikh Nizar Rayan and Said Siam, the interior minister – during Cast Lead. But the accumulation of horror is not stressed, as Milton-Edwards and Farrell keep a studied, distanced tone.</p>
<p>One of Hamas’s surviving iconic leaders is Sheikh Muhammad Abu-Tir. He is a man who moved from Fatah to Hamas and was in and out of Israeli jails, from the 1980s, for thirty years. In 2006, he was placed second only to Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh in Hamas’s electoral list in the parliamentary elections. He was arrested again soon afterwards, released and barred from his home in East Jerusalem. Abu-Tir’s dramatic life illustrates many of the themes in the books under discussion, including the weight and prestige of the tens of thousands of Palestinian prisoners and former prisoners in Palestinian grassroots politics. <italic>Threat</italic> is an original work on these prisoners, edited by Abeer Baker and Anat Matar, and the first to recognise the centrality of the prisoners’ movement, both in history and to the present day. It contains a mass of information in essays and reports from lawyers, academics, human rights workers, prisoners themselves and their families. Individuals’ contributions tell stories of great value, such as that of Sheikh Abu-Tir in an interview, and that of Osama Barham, a veteran of twenty years in prison. The human rights organisations, such as Adalah, Addameer, the Public Committee against Torture, Israeli Association of Physicians for Human Rights, B’Tselem, and several others, together with the lawyers who fight these cases over and over, here bring out a reality of Palestinian society that deserves much more attention than the acres of newsprint devoted to the statements of those involved in the so-called peace processes.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1990s, the facts on the ground in Palestine daily illustrated the hypocrisy behind the ‘peace process’. The expansion of settlements on occupied Palestinian lands, which continued despite every kind of peace talk throughout these years, was always the centre-piece of every failure. With Israel’s building of the Separation Wall (declared illegal by the International Court of Justice) and the network of bypass roads for settlers, the two-state solution that was the centre-piece of peace negotiations was long recognised as dead in Palestine. In response, in 2005, and bypassing the old political structures, 171 civil society groups in Palestine moved into a new phase of demanding international civil society’s support for Palestinian rights, calling for boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel to force it to change its policies. Omar Barghouti’s <italic>Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions: the global struggle for Palestinian rights</italic> tells the story of five years of this peaceful citizens’ movement, with partners across the world, to end the occupation, dismantle the Separation Wall, give Arab-Palestinians in Israel total equality and respect the rights of refugees to return.</p>
<p>The civil society demands are the old ones that al-Hout and his political generation would have recognised, and the BDS campaign bases itself optimistically on the grassroots campaign that helped to bring the apartheid regime down in South Africa. However, the strategic importance of Israel to the US far outstrips that of white South Africa, and, as <italic>The Palestine Papers</italic> reveals, there is no sign of the US, under President Obama, making any change in its unwavering support for Israel’s continuing squeezing of historic Palestine out of its rights, by means of assassinations, economic blockades, social control of Palestinians’ living and working conditions and a relentless propaganda campaign. These books together are an effective antidote to that propaganda campaign and deserve to be widely read.</p>
