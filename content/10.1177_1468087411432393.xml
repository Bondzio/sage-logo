<abstract>
<p>Transient vehicle emissions, as measured in test cells or by on-board systems, do not precisely reflect the emissions at the exhaust because the instantaneous emissions are dispersed in time by the sampling and analyser systems. With increasing demand for accurate emission measurements to optimize engine controls and for atmospheric inventory models, research effort has been directed at compensating for measurement distortions by the emissions analyser system. This paper presents a new procedure, known as the modified deconvolution technique, which may be employed for the reconstruction of instantaneous emissions signals. The method was applied to revising mass rates of emissions as a function of speed and acceleration for the case of a transit bus. This revision (or reconstruction) led to a higher range of emissions rates and, for most high-power speed-acceleration bins, the mass emissions rate was increased. For bins with high deceleration, emissions rates were reduced.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>There is increasing interest in developing vehicle emissions models that predict instantaneous emissions, particularly for conformity studies to assess impacts of new traffic facilities or changes in traffic controls. The instantaneous emissions values might be expressed as a function of vehicle operating conditions. For example, mass emissions rates might be expressed based on vehicle speed and acceleration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087411432393">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087411432393">2</xref>], and average emissions mass rates might be ascribed to speed-acceleration bins in a matrix. Ideally, instantaneous emissions are the actual emissions produced by the engine at a specific point in time at the engine manifold, or else they may be modified by after-treatment systems before they leave the engine stack or tailpipe. A measurement system can be used to record these instantaneous engine-out emissions, but the measurement system will distort the signal that corresponds to the instantaneous emissions and produce an output signal, which represents the ‘measured’ emissions. For some fast response research hardware [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087411432393">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087411432393">4</xref>], the measured emissions will be much the same as the instantaneous emissions. However, most sampling and analyser systems used in transient test cells, or in on-board portable emission measurement systems, will report a distorted signal through the process of measurement. For example, the emissions reported by the analyser may be delayed and dispersed relative to the instantaneous emissions. In contrast, measured speed and acceleration are usually faithful representations of the instantaneous values. Unfortunately, this means that the measured emissions may not be related appropriately to the measured speed and acceleration of the vehicle. Traditionally, researchers and regulators have sought only to align the emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087411432393">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087411432393">7</xref>] with the vehicle activity in time, without considering the effect of diffusion in time. Failure to consider dispersion leads to inaccuracy in resulting predictive models, typically resulting in emissions values in a bin that have been tainted by vehicle activity which is actually outside of that bin. If the emissions can be related uniquely to each speed and acceleration event, then this diffusion of information between bins can be eliminated. This paper presents appropriate post-processing of emissions data, and confirms that the diffusion of emissions information between speed-acceleration bins can be reduced by such post-processing.</p>

<title>2 The Effect of Time Dispersion of Data on The Average Bin EmissionS</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411432393">Figures 1(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411432393">(b)</xref> present a schematic of two hypothetical emission measurement situations. In one, the emissions mass rate is low, then rapidly transitions to a high value, then rapidly returns to a low value. In the other situation, a short constant acceleration event is mimicked. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411432393">Fig. 1 (a)</xref>, the solid rectangle (and a solid trapezoid in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411432393">Fig. 1(b)</xref>) represents the instantaneous emissions. However, when the analyser measures this rectangular (or trapezoidal) response, it will be distributed as the dotted parabolic curve. This is the measured response, and it can be noted that the measured response is distributed over a larger time interval and has an average lower than the instantaneous (reconstructed) emissions.</p>

</fig>
<p>Due to the analyser response delay, the start of the dotted line should follow the start of the thick line. However, when these two continuous sets of data (measured emissions and instantaneous emissions) are time aligned using cross-correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087411432393">8</xref>] (usually matches peaks and troughs), the measured response shifts to the left, and the responses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411432393">Figs 1(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411432393">(b)</xref> are after time alignment.</p>
<p>Hence, the emissions measured in a particular activity bin may be the emissions that actually belong to another activity bin. These emissions ‘bleed’ from one bin to another due to dispersion. Hence post-processing the measured emissions is necessary to relate the emissions properly to their corresponding operating conditions.</p>

<title>3 Earlier Work on Emissions Reconstruction</title>
<p>The authors have previously presented two different approaches for reconstruction of transient emissions from heavy-duty engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087411432393">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411432393">10</xref>]. They are the sequential inversion technique (SIT) and the differential coefficients method (DCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087411432393">11</xref>]. The SIT is a simple step-by-step deconvolution technique in the time domain. It failed to reconstruct any real-time data successfully without exhibiting runaway instability. The DCM was introduced by Ajtay and Weilenmann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087411432393">11</xref>], and involved mapping the instantaneous emissions as a linear combination of the analyser output signal and its derivatives. A brief description of the DCM follows.</p>
<p>Let x(t) be the input to the analyser, y(t) be the output and y<sup>/</sup>(t) and y<sup>//</sup>(t) be the first and second derivatives of the output. In this method, the input can be expressed as the sum of the output and some linear combinations of the first and second derivatives of the output. The input x(t) and output y(t) and its derivatives are related by the following expression</p>

For a known response to a unit impulse function (which can be determined experimentally), minimizing the error between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1468087411432393">equation (1)</xref> should generate the coefficients a<sub>1</sub> and a<sub>2</sub>. These values can be used to generate the instantaneous input from the measured output y(t) and its derivatives, y<sup>/</sup>(t) and y<sup>//</sup>(t). The DCM was able to reconstruct continuous emissions from real-time data. The results with the DCM have been presented comprehensively elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087411432393">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411432393">10</xref>]. Trials were made to improve the DCM by adding more derivatives, and by trying different numerical ways to compute the derivatives, improvements were possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087411432393">9</xref>].</p>

<title>4 Estimating The Transient Dynamics of The Analyser</title>
<p>To enable reconstruction, the transient dynamics of the analyser need to be estimated. For this purpose, the instantaneous impulse response characteristics of the two analysers used for emission measurements were studied. The response tests were conducted on a Rosemount 955 NO analyser (manufactured by Emerson Electric Co, St. Louis, MO) and a Horiba AIA 210 CO<sub>2</sub> analyser (manufactured by Horiba Automotive Test Systems, Ann Arbor, MI). All the data analysed in this study were measured only by these analysers. The Rosemount 955 analyser worked on a phenomenon called chemiluminescence, in which photons of light were produced by a chemical or electrochemical reaction. The analyser is capable of measuring either NO or total NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. To determine NO, the sample NO is converted to NO<sub>2</sub> by oxidation using molecular ozone. During this reaction, about 10 per cent of NO<sub>2</sub> molecules get elevated to an excited state, and then when the molecules come back to the non-excited state, photon emission takes place. The emitted photons are detected and the response of the analyser is proportional to the total NO in the converted sample. To determine the total NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, a similar procedure was followed, except that the gas stream was passed through a converter that converts all the NO<sub>2</sub> into NO. The instrument response, in this case, is proportional to the NO present in the original sample plus the NO produced by the dissociation of NO<sub>2</sub>. To analyse CO<sub>2</sub>, Horiba’s AIA 210, a non-dispersive infra-red (NDIR) analyser was employed. Before the exhaust gas sample enters the analyser, the sample is dried to avoid moisture. There is a particular wavelength of the infrared energy at which each of the gaseous components is absorbed. The amount of energy absorbed at a wavelength corresponding to CO<sub>2</sub> could be measured and is directly proportional to the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the exhaust. The working principles of these analysers were described in more detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411432393">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The response of a Rosemount 955 NO analyser to an instantaneous pulse of input of NO is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087411432393">Fig. 2(a)</xref>. In an engine test cell, a balloon was filled with 1 litre of NO with a concentration of 1000 parts per million (ppm) and inserted in the dilution tunnel. The balloon was burst to simulate a pulse of short duration relative to the diffusion phenomena. The pulse travelled via the dilution tunnel and sampling lines to the Rosemount 955 analyser, and the analyser output was collected. The time delay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087411432393">Fig. 2 (a)</xref> is a function of the length of the sampling lines and speed of the exhaust gas travel through the lines. The response was found to be dispersed over a period of 6 s. The response was 5 Hz, and the fraction of the response in each interval (0.2 s) is represented by a point. The shape of the response is obtained by connecting all such points with simple straight lines. If the fractions of the response are less than 0.05 per cent, all such fractions were considered insignificant, and were added as one fraction on either side of the response. It should be noted that only the dispersion of the instantaneous pulse by the analyser system is of interest in this analysis. A similar procedure was followed to obtain the response of the Horiba AIA210 analyser.</p>

<title>5 Modified Deconvolution Technique (Mdt)</title>
<p>A brief description of the reconstruction procedure is as follows. Based on the authors’ empirical observations, the impulse response of the analyser can be modelled as a gamma probability density function (PDF). The analyser system was modelled based on the assumption that it is linear and time invariant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087411432393">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087411432393">13</xref>]. Then, the analyser was completely characterized by an impulse response, a response of the analyser to an instantaneous pulse, denoted by H(t). The approximation of the gamma PDF depends on the analyser used. For example, the Rosemount 955 NO analyser will have a different gamma PDF from a Horiba AIA 210 CO<sub>2</sub> analyser. A two-parameter (k and θ) gamma PDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087411432393">14</xref>], denoted by G(t), is provided by</p>

<p>These two equations generated the values of the parameters k and θ. These parameters established a specific function G(t) to describe the response. Alternately, one might find G(t) from H(t) using a best-fit regression, but this method was not employed in the present paper.</p>
<p>The values for k and θ were found using the method described above for both CO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> as species. For CO<sub>2</sub>, the values were k = 1.85 and θ = 2.20, and for NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, the values were k = 1.88 and θ = 2.22. However, the continuous emissions data that were examined in this paper were obtained with a different dilution tunnel than the one used for the response determination, and so the authors believed it was necessary to determine that these values of k and θ were still applicable. The continuous data for CO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> were available, along with values for instantaneous power. The authors assumed that CO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> were strongly related to power, and there are compelling arguments on engine efficiency and emissions compliance, along with existing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087411432393">15</xref>], to support this assumption. The measured CO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> data were transformed, as described below, to yield the best estimate of instantaneous engine-out emissions. These were compared, through correlation, with instantaneous power using the k and θ values presented above. Both k and θ were then varied over a range of k = 1.67 to 2.04 for CO<sub>2</sub> and k = 1.69 to 2.07 for NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, and θ = 1.98 to 2.42 for CO<sub>2</sub> and θ = 2.00 to 2.44 for NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. The values of k and θ that correlated best under these circumstances were chosen for further use. The optimal values that were found using this method were very close to the original values determined from the response functions. The final values were k = 1.87 and θ = 2.20 for CO<sub>2</sub> and k = 1.91 and θ = 2.20 for NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. These were used for further analysis.</p>
<p>A fast Fourier transform (FFT), employed previously by Madireddy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411432393">10</xref>], was used to compute efficiently the reconstructed input x(t) using the following simple procedure. Let X be the analyser input, Y the analyser output and H the transfer function of the analyser. H<sub>w</sub> is the Fast fourier transform of the transfer function of the analyser. The FFT first transforms both the estimated impulse response and the output signal of the analyser into a frequency domain (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-1468087411432393">equation 4(a)</xref>). Then, a simple division (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-1468087411432393">equation 4(b)</xref>) is employed in the frequency domain to compute the input in the frequency domain. The inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) of that input transfers the input into the time domain (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-1468087411432393">equation 4(c)</xref>).</p>

<title>6 Validation of The MDT/ Comparison With The DCM</title>
<p>To validate the MDT, the data were collected from the chassis testing conducted in the West Virginia University (WVU) Transportable Heavy-Duty Vehicle Emissions Testing Laboratory on a Peterbilt Truck with a Caterpillar 3406E engine fitted to a 19-speed Eaton Fuller transmission with 550 hp. The engine power was generated by the engine control unit, which was based on the fuel consumption and the engine efficiency curves. The correlation of measured CO<sub>2</sub> with power was calculated. The reconstruction of the data was attempted using the MDT. The MDT increased the correlation of emissions with power. More importantly, the reconstructed input by the MDT correlated better (R<sup>2</sup> of 0.9211) with power than the input generated by the DCM (R<sup>2</sup> of 0.9006).</p>
<p>The previous work involving the validation studies of DCM and MDT techniques by the authors proved that the MDT can reconstruct the transient emissions better than the DCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087411432393">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411432393">10</xref>]. The improvement in predicting the emissions with the DCM (on an average of eight data sets, four for NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and four for CO<sub>2</sub>) is about 1.5 per cent. The corresponding marginal improvement with the MDT was about 2.5 per cent. While these numbers may be dependent to some extent on the data itself, the overall conclusion is that the MDT was able to predict more accurately the true instantaneous emissions. Hence, the MDT was the only method chosen for the reconstruction presented in this paper. The data were time aligned using cross-correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087411432393">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468087411432393">18</xref>].</p>

<title>8 Data Analysis</title>
<sec id="section9-1468087411432393">
<title>8.1 Comparison of measured and reconstructed emissions</title>
<p>At each point in time, the measured emissions were available, and the MDT was used to produce a corresponding, predicted instantaneous (reconstructed) value. The measured and reconstructed data sets for the bus were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087411432393">Fig. 3</xref>); the best correlation between the measured and reconstructed data sets yielded a slope close to unity and an intercept close to zero. However, the range of the reconstructed data was greater than the range of the measured data because the peaks and troughs associated with transient operation of the vehicle were diffused by the measuring system. If the reconstructed data were considered to be the true emissions, it can be implied from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087411432393">Fig. 3</xref> that for any true emissions value, the corresponding measured values vary over a range. For example, the reconstructed emissions of 30 g/s yielded measured values from about 23 to 37 g/s. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468087411432393">Table 1</xref>, it can be implied that, while the averages of the measured and the reconstructed data sets were much the same, the standard deviation and the range of the whole reconstructed set were higher. For a sufficiently long sampling time, the average value of the reconstructed signal will approach closely the average value of the measured signal, but this will not hold true for short time periods: for an instantaneous comparison, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087411432393">Fig. 3</xref>, the difference will be a maximum. A small negative value for the emissions rate represented the minimum after reconstruction.</p>

<title>8.2 Average emissions for different operating conditions</title>
<p>While one parameter such as speed, acceleration or load is not sufficient to uniquely represent an instantaneous operating condition of a vehicle, a combination of speed and acceleration of the vehicle at an instant in time was earlier proved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087411432393">2</xref>] to represent a vehicle operation. Instantaneous power is a function of speed and acceleration, and for unthrottled diesel engines, instantaneous mass rate of CO<sub>2</sub> is closely related to instantaneous power. Moreover, while measured emissions are dispersed, the measured values of speed and acceleration are usually closer to their instantaneous values. For these reasons, each operating condition was represented by a combination of a range of speed and a range of acceleration. For species such as carbon monoxide and particulate matter, other engine parameters may be needed for emissions prediction, but the diffusion problem will impact the model in the same way as is illustrated for CO<sub>2</sub> below.</p>
<p>One data point was available at each second over the UDDS. The data were divided into 63 (9 × 7) bins based on speed and acceleration ranges, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468087411432393">Table 2</xref>. Each bin had a specific speed range and specific acceleration range, and the resolution was coarse out of necessity because there are relatively few data. The vehicle speed ranged from 0 to 57 mile/h for a UDDS. Hence, the range of speeds for bins across the rows was from 0 to 6.333 (which is 57/9) mile/h for the first column, 6.333 mile/h to 12.666 (which is 2 × 57/9) mile/h for the second column and so on. The acceleration range was divided similarly into seven equal rows. Each bin contained data for several instances of operation.</p>

<p>Variability of emissions values in each bin occurred due to size of the bin, transient effects, diffusion of emissions data and lack of repeatability of the bus and measurement system. The emissions values in each bin were averaged. Analysing the emissions in each of these bins associated the operating conditions (in a small range) with emissions data. The continuous sets of measured data were reconstructed using the MDT. These data were also divided into bins in the same procedure as the one followed for the measured emissions. After the data were reconstructed, the emissions values in each of the bins changed. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468087411432393">Table 3</xref>. Consider the bin with the lowest average acceleration (−1.50 m/s<sup>2</sup>). For this bin, the ratios of the averages and standard deviations of reconstructed to measured CO<sub>2</sub> were computed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087411432393">Fig. 5(a)</xref>). It can be inferred that, when the vehicle was decelerating, the reconstructed values were lower than the corresponding measured values. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087411432393">Figure 5(b)</xref> shows how the ratios slightly increased for a bin with highest acceleration (1.06 m/s<sup>2</sup>). This was because the analyser system under-read the highest amplitudes (peaks), which usually correspond to high vehicle acceleration, and over-read the lowest amplitudes (troughs), which usually correspond to the vehicle deceleration. Hence, the ratio of reconstructed to measured bin averages increases during acceleration and decreases during deceleration.</p>

<title>9 Discussion and Applications</title>
<p>If continuous emissions data for 1000 s were considered, the average of the emissions rate measured by the analyser was found to be approximately equal to the average rate of the true (instantaneous) emissions. However, for a given operating condition (defined by vehicle speed and acceleration), the average of measured emissions differed from the instantaneous average. This is because of the dispersion associated with the measurement system. In most circumstances, the measured emissions may be sufficient to support an inventory model. However, if the model is required to perform accurately over small time and space scales, such as in a conformity study for a traffic control signal that results in periodic vehicle acceleration, then the reconstruction will improve the inventory estimation at that location.</p>
<p>For inventory models, it is of interest to associate emissions with vehicle activity. The MDT could improve the instantaneous emissions inventory models based on speed-acceleration matrices, or other combinations of vehicle speed and acceleration,as are used in Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087411432393">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468087411432393">21</xref>]. If one wishes to divide activity into speed-acceleration bins and assign emission mass rate values to each bin, it can be achieved by using instantaneous data, as shown in this study and by assigning the emissions value at each moment in time to the related bin. The ultimate value in that bin, to be used for modelling purposes, can be found by averaging all values placed in that bin. This procedure can be used to compensate for the delay and dispersion of the emissions data used to populate a model. The result would be a tool for instantaneous emissions modelling that has superior time resolution and more accurate predictions of emissions for sustained high and low load operation. This procedure could also be incorporated into other emissions prediction models such as Computer Programme to calculate Emissions from Road Transport (COPERT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468087411432393">22</xref>].</p>
