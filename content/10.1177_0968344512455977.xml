<abstract>
<p>Culture as an underlying factor in Australian discipline during the Great War deserves further exploration. Most accounts relate a poor disciplinary record compared with Australia’s British and Dominion allies. A new perspective, proposing a different underlying attitude to leadership and service, is offered as one element contributing to the explanation of the different attitudes to discipline. Based on the discourse in one cultural artefact, the prose literature of the war, this paper investigates how Australian egalitarian expectations contrasted with the paternal-deferential relationship between British officers and their men. Three factors in particular contributed to the Anzac attitude to discipline: the explicit egalitarian values of Australian society, the Anzac conception of the war as work rather than a crusade, and the Australians’ persistent citizen self-identity.</p>

<p>Cultural attitudes offer important insights into both the historical record and the popular conception of Australian discipline during the Great War. Official histories, scholarly analyses, memoirs, and fictional accounts of the Australian Imperial Force all relate a relatively poor disciplinary record by comparison with other sections of the British and Dominion armies. This record is rarely disputed and even less frequently deplored, at least in Australia.</p>
<p>Through proposing a different underlying attitude to leadership and service, this essay offers a new perspective founded on the discourse in the prose literature of the war, as one instance of a cultural artefact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0968344512455977">1</xref></sup> While British men and officers operated through a deferential bargain, as described by Sheffield,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0968344512455977">2</xref></sup> this paper proposes that Australians, by contrast, expected an ‘egalitarian bargain’. I will argue that the explicit egalitarian values of Australian society, the Australians’ attitude to the war as work rather than a crusade for ideals, and their determined self-identification as a citizen army all contributed to create the image of the laconic, irreverent, cavalier Anzacs in Great War narrative accounts. The extent to which this image was perceived as real by the Australians themselves and by those who came into contact with them during the war is less easily measured, but the literary record indicates that the perception was widespread.</p>
<p>The relationship of the narrative accounts to the historical record is as complex as that of any cultural objects to the understanding of the historical events upon which they were founded. There is a degree of consistency in the depiction of Australians which argues that an accepted stereotype was received by the majority of the writers; the accuracy and universal applicability of the stereotype is a problematic calculation. However, through providing an additional perspective on the well-documented Australian ill-discipline, the notion of an egalitarian bargain can enrich our appreciation of the complex operation of discrete cultural values in both behaviour and the perception of behaviour.</p>
<p>Discipline can be defined as deference to authority. Fuller proposes that ‘discipline is essentially a matter of consent’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0968344512455977">3</xref></sup> Discipline rests on a formal or informal agreement between subordinates and their superiors, in which the followers cede decision-making to the authority of the leaders. The superiors usually have greater wisdom, knowledge or power than their followers. Superiors are expected to use their power, or other superior quality, for the benefit of the followers; the exchange of deference for authority is assumed to benefit the group as a whole. In this way a parent has authority over a child, and a state assumes authority over a population. In the context of the Great War, the fact that millions of men consented to place their lives in the hands of their army’s leaders deserves closer inspection. It is not universally agreed that submitting to the discipline of the army was in this case either morally or practically wise. The ‘good’ of the whole group is often seen as compromised by the cost of the Allies’ eventual victory.</p>
<p>The poor quality of leadership has been represented as one major cause of the appalling cost of Allied victory in the Great War. Revisionist historians decry this perspective as ahistorical, but many still believe that the gross failure of Great War leadership led to the loss of a generation for no gain. This conventional belief, founded largely on ‘disenchantment’ literature such as the poetry of Owen and Sassoon, was in later decades propagated through mass texts such as <italic>Blackadder Goes Forth</italic> (1989),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0968344512455977">4</xref></sup> and illustrates effectively the capacity of literary texts to engender socio-historical responses and values. From this disillusioned perspective, high-ranking British officers had little regard for the welfare of their men, who were ‘lions led by donkeys’. Criticism of Great War leadership continues to be widespread in popular histories and fictional treatments of the war, even though the view of current academic history is less censorious.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0968344512455977">5</xref></sup> The ‘donkeys’ trope has been effectively refuted but it remains a common feature of popular memory,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0968344512455977">6</xref></sup> and has become a foundational premise of contemporary and later narrative accounts written from the ‘disenchantment’ perspective.</p>
<p>Even while identifying the many errors and the lengthy learning process, revisionist scholars contend that the continuing popular impression of futility and culpability is a hindsight-informed exaggeration of mistakes made under duress, in the presence of fixed attitudes, in contingent situations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0968344512455977">7</xref></sup> Most research, while still identifying instances of incompetence, now appreciates both the proficiency and the blunders of the Allied leadership as well as its role in bringing the war to a conclusion. Similarly, a number of faults among Australian leaders (that is, errors which cannot be conveniently attributed to the British higher command) have also been identified<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0968344512455977">8</xref></sup> as scholars disentangle the events of each phase of the war, tracing each sequence of decisions, actions, and outcomes. Failures in discipline, nevertheless, cannot be solely attributed to faults in Great War leadership.</p>
<p>Discipline is not a universal concept, but culturally based. Culture-specific notions of implied assent and reciprocity underlie the officer–man relationship as they underlie other social relationships of unequal power such as that between parent and child. Transgressions on either side violate these agreed formal or implicit contracts.</p>
<p>There are different expectations about leadership underlying British and Australian narrative accounts, both fiction and non-fiction, of the war. Australian veteran, novelist, and philosopher J.P. McKinney claimed of his countrymen, ‘We’re an awkward crowd to deal with. You can’t tell a damned officer from a private by his manner. Very confusing, that.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0968344512455977">9</xref></sup> Although ethno-psychology texts conflate the ‘old’ (that is, pre-Second World War) Anglo democracies such as the UK, Ireland, Canada, the USA, New Zealand, and Australia, discernible cultural differences persist. Hofstede, in extensive studies of corporate personnel across cultures, identified five major aspects of cultural difference: high versus low power distance; collectivism versus individualism; strong or weak uncertainty avoidance; shortor long-term goal orientation; and masculinity versus femininity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0968344512455977">10</xref></sup> His data locate Australia’s cultural values very closely with those of Britain, with the greatest variation in the uncertainty avoidance index. The differences between the two cultures may be in the matter of degree, or it may be that the averaged corporate responses do not sufficiently reflect the extremes among the wider populations. Hofstede makes a strong case for the consistency of ‘national character’ across time, demonstrating the powerful forces which act to normalize alternative views and attitudes into compliance with the national consensus. He does, additionally, warn that corporate culture does not equal national culture, despite its demonstrated links. Ethno-psychology data do not completely explain cultural differences, just as popular stereotypes do not totally match cultural reality.</p>
<p>The differences between the British and Australian national characters are of a lesser degree than differences between the Anglo-cultures and eastern, collectivist, and non-democratic cultures. The lack of significant distinction between Australia and Britain in Hofstede’s work can be partly explained by the aggregation of results for Britain itself. Australians in the Great War reportedly had more in common, culturally, with the Highland regiments than with the English,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0968344512455977">11</xref></sup> but, significantly, no distinction is made between Scotland and England in Hofstede’s studies.</p>
<p>The notion of discipline encompasses the relationship between the leader and the followers. The common concept that Australian Great War troops were ill-disciplined and lacked respect for authority, though sometimes contradicted, is documented by many and forms part of Australian cultural memory, often celebrated, less often deplored.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0968344512455977">12</xref></sup> Corns and Hughes-Wilson summarize this well: ‘the Australians had a curious reputation on the Western Front. Whilst no one doubted their ferocity in action or their fighting ability, they were, by British Army standards, woefully undisciplined,’ with a ‘cavalier attitude to formal discipline’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0968344512455977">13</xref></sup> Intuitively, the combination of disrespect for British ‘donkeys’ and lack of discipline should dictate a rejection of leadership per se, but this is not the case in Australian prose narratives of the Great War.</p>
<p>Australian cultural attitudes towards leaders and leadership in general differ from those existing, then and now, in the cultures of its major Great War allies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0968344512455977">14</xref></sup> All cultures have implicit understandings of leadership, and subordinates in each culture will comply with superordinates who enact that implicit model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0968344512455977">15</xref></sup> For example, followers expecting and valuing a decisive, autocratic leader will be confused by a participative leader who requests advice from them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0968344512455977">16</xref></sup> I suggest that discrete cultural variations underlie the implicit British and Australian leadership models.</p>
<p>The ‘lax’ application of army discipline, for example refusal on the part of the Australian government to approve the death sentences which Australian courts martial delivered on up to 126 occasions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0968344512455977">17</xref></sup> cannot fully explain the endemic scorn of saluting, ‘spit and polish’, and ‘hop to it’ which the Australians alone of the Dominion forces continued to show throughout the war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0968344512455977">18</xref></sup> In particular, the notion of leadership in a culturally egalitarian society contrasts with the traditional, class-based deference for superiors expected in British society. These cultural variations underpin the fundamental differences between Australian and British conceptions of officer–man relationships. The undisciplined British soldier looks a similar type to the undisciplined Australian one, but each understood differently the discipline against which he rebelled: ‘what works in one culture may not necessarily work in another’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0968344512455977">19</xref></sup> Australian troops consented to a bond that, although formally the same as the British agreement, was based on different assumptions. These are clearly articulated in the prose literature that grew out of the war as well as in personal papers of the time.</p>
<p>Letters, diaries, and prose accounts of the time display a wide variation of attitudes and experiences, but discernible trends reinforce the <italic>notion</italic> of Australian egalitarianism. Like the wider Australian social egalitarianism described by Thompson, egalitarianism in the Australian army was in most cases more notional than real: it was an accepted ideal, not necessarily a uniform circumstance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0968344512455977">20</xref></sup> Dale Blair, in his extensive study of the records and personal artefacts of the Australian First Battalion, explains that, although the Australians ‘believed themselves to be equal, man to man, to their superiors’, their relationships with their officers were not especially intimate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0968344512455977">21</xref></sup> At least, such relationships were not as intimate as the use of first names would indicate in (or to) a more class-conscious society. A Briton who called his officer by his first name would seem to be either insolent or else to have a close personal connection to the officer – to be a relative or a close friend. It would be erroneous to apply this expectation to the Australians. The fact that an Australian calls his superior by his first name (and/or vice versa) does not, in Australian society then or now, indicate that there is any personal relationship at all. All Australians, from the newest baby to the prime minister, are subject to address by their first names, whether they are personally known to their interlocutor or not. Just as socio-economic class difference does not dictate deferential address in Australia, intimate personal knowledge does not inflect the legitimacy of the use of first names. All are subject to such irreverent, or undiscriminating, or ‘egalitarian’, usage. However, a more hierarchical society may see the use of first names as insolence when no such impertinence was intended or perceived by the speaker. One AIF diarist asserts that Australians ‘failing to call a British town major “sir” may actually have been paying him a “delicate compliment” by treating him as a “reasonable bloke”’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0968344512455977">22</xref></sup> a ‘reasonable bloke’ being one with whom they could interact on egalitarian terms.</p>
<p>An Irish-born teacher in the AIF described the Australian attitude to discipline in a letter of January 1916, commenting that, like the Australian schoolboy with his ‘independence and lack of appreciation of what Discipline means’, Australian soldiers ‘can’t be coerced, [though] perhaps they might respond to good leaders’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0968344512455977">23</xref></sup> Good Australian officers ‘tolerated what might have been punished in the British army … If they were efficient and just, this was as much as they could do to establish their authority until they had undergone the test of battle.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0968344512455977">24</xref></sup> The mere fact of having rank did not (and does not) entitle a person to any particular deference; the Australian officer needed to prove himself as an individual to earn the respect which in other cultures may attach to the rank itself. A protest poem addressed to the Australian official historian C.E.W. Bean after his rather unflattering report of the Australians in Egypt began with the lines, ‘Do yer think yer Gawd Almighty / Cos yer wears a Captain’s stars?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0968344512455977">25</xref></sup> Bean’s honorary rank could not protect him from disrespect, and it was not until he earned admiration for his cool courage at Gallipoli that he was forgiven and admitted to the confidences of the men.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the novel <italic>Flesh in Armour</italic> (1932) by the veteran Australian author Leonard Mann, Captain Slade, rather than ‘isolate himself from his platoon, just after taking over,’ decides not to ‘provoke’ the men by disbelieving the patently untrue alibis they give to Artie Fethers, charged for being absent without a pass.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0968344512455977">26</xref></sup> They ‘resented a decent coot like Artie being crimed. No one in the battalion could throw a bomb as accurately as he.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0968344512455977">27</xref></sup> They decide to proffer the false alibis because they ‘felt they could not trust the case to their new captain’;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0968344512455977">28</xref></sup> that is, they could not – yet – trust him to protect them from higher authority or over-diligent application of the military writ. They have no faith in the rank as a rank; it is the man who must be gauged. They are testing his fitness, in terms of their implicit officer–man contract, for his post. Slade’s decision to dismiss the charge rests on his fear of being rejected by the platoon, a fear greater than that of not supporting the military police. Thus the relationship has reciprocal power balances, with the men having a degree of dominance over the captain. The men have no compunction in deceiving the captain (or rather, pretending to deceive him and knowing he is not deceived), and no fear that their perjured testimony will be rejected; Slade would not transgress the egalitarian bargain so far as to call them to account.</p>
<p>Australian G.D. Mitchell, MC, DCM, himself a number of times promoted and later demoted, explains in his 1937 memoir how confronting (and tempting) he found the British officer’s self-assurance and obvious class-consciousness:
<disp-quote>
<p>A British regular’s mess makes a deep impression on a newcomer used to the boisterous routine of our messes. The correctness, the extreme courtesy, the absolute changelessness of age-old things, causes the less-polished Digger to toy furtively with the idea of making a good healthy <italic>faux-pas</italic>. One gained the impression, somehow, that the war was an intrusion into the social order; a thing to be tacitly ignored. The conversation floated airily round unimportant things. In our messes the officers would be discussing problems of fighting with single-mindedness known only to cruder beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0968344512455977">29</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mitchell relates that when a shell exploded nearby, he left the mess to see to his men and make provision for the wounded, while the British officers retreated to ‘the deep dugout’. On his return, he was questioned about his actions and asked why the NCOs had not undertaken that particular duty. Referring to his much-admired commander, R.L. Leane, MC, DSO and bar, <italic>Croix de Guerre</italic>, Mitchell reflects:
<disp-quote>
<p>The gap between our viewpoints struck me then. But of course they had no steely-eyed Bull [Leane] to ask nasty questions in edged tones, such as ‘Why were you under cover and your men exposed?’ I took refuge … by explaining that in the AIF such separation of men and officers under fire was ‘not done’ … We were a long way apart from our English brothers. In our army, the man was nearer to the officer, the officer nearer to the man. I would not have it any other way. We were not hounded by the fear that our men would not respect us if we associated too closely with them. If they did not respect us, well ____blast ’em!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0968344512455977">30</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mitchell subscribes to, and also participates in creating, the Australian myth of egalitarianism even in such a hierarchical organization as the army. If the historical accuracy of this has been questioned as an exaggeration, the idea survives even on such slender evidence, and certainly by comparison with the patent hierarchy in the British army, a comparison noted by British as well as Australian authors. The irreverent egalitarianism is a typical representation not only in Australian Great War narratives, but also in British narratives which describe Australians. Egalitarianism is fundamental to the relationship between the Australian leader and his followers.</p>
<p>Dalglish and Evans provide a concise summary of the scholarly literature on Australian cultural attitudes to leadership.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0968344512455977">31</xref></sup> Australian style presumes an egalitarian, meritocratic society with a low power distance;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0968344512455977">32</xref></sup> that is, a belief that personal status does not rest on social class or position and that ‘a cat may look at a king’. This differs from the ‘peculiar social background’ of class-conscious Britons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0968344512455977">33</xref></sup> Further, Australians are not prepared to follow orders without knowing the reasons behind them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0968344512455977">34</xref></sup> According to Dalglish and Evans, ‘Australians expect to be told the truth and are generally prepared to face it’; they have in addition ‘finely tuned “bullshit detectors”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0968344512455977">35</xref></sup> Australians expect their leaders to be inspirational, to have high integrity, to recognize individuals, and to eschew self-promotion. The successful leader in Australia will communicate consultatively and place high trust in those he or she leads.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0968344512455977">36</xref></sup> ‘The most powerful way to motivate Australians is to offer them a cause – something that transcends being the “biggest” or the “best” and has desirable social, moral, national or community associations.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0968344512455977">37</xref></sup> Framing the war as a transcendent, nation-forming experience, as most Anzac stories do, aligns with this attitude.</p>
<p>Analysing the relationships between the leaders and the followers in the context of the Great War shows important differences between British and Australian attitudes to discipline in the narrative accounts. British narratives criticize leadership that fails to fulfil a presupposed <italic>deferential</italic> bargain; Australian narratives accept leaders who operate via an <italic>egalitarian</italic> bargain.</p>
<p>Sheffield describes the British ‘deferential bargain’ as a cultural understanding between the men and their officers, based on shared beliefs about paternalism on the part of the upper class/officer class and due deference from the lower class/private soldier. The abrogation of paternal responsibilities by high-ranking leaders is one of the strongest historical and popular critiques of the Great War’s prosecution.</p>
<p>In the deferential bargain, officers undertake a paternal role and men accord them respect according to how well they fulfil their paternal duties, such as caring for the men’s safety and comfort, protecting them from the harsher aspects of the military code, and displaying leadership on the field. Clayton explains that the British soldiers accepted the superior military rank of the officer just as at home they accepted his superior social rank.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0968344512455977">38</xref></sup> The men expected their officers to have ‘professional competence, a degree of understanding, confidence and a certain style’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0968344512455977">39</xref></sup> Sheffield maintains that the relationships between officers and men in the British army in the main operated well throughout the war, with the most spiteful scorn of the men reserved for generals and staff officers, who were not in a position to espouse paternalism. Sheffield traces a long history of British culture that supports the operation of the deferential bargain in both rural and industrial settings. By citing the shared beliefs of the officers and men, Sheffield poses the deferential bargain as a universal understanding in both the regular and the new British army. The class divisions, premised upon each side fulfilling its implied duties, that is, benevolence on the part of bosses/squires/officers and compliance from workers/farmers/soldiers, assisted the British citizen soldier to operate effectively in the army.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0968344512455977">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The prose accounts support Sheffield’s notions, assuming as well as describing a patent division between social classes. The most highly regarded British Great War narratives were written by junior officers, and it is from this perspective that we gain an appreciation of how they understood their paternal duties. In these accounts we see that British officers are aware of their paternal role and consider that, without their supervision, the men are helpless. A.P. Herbert’s young officers in <italic>The Secret Battle</italic> (1919) discover this on their first night on Gallipoli: ‘there was a great muddle at the front. Troops of two different brigades were hopelessly entangled [because] … they had few officers left.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0968344512455977">41</xref></sup> In <italic>Memoirs of an Infantry Officer</italic> (1930) Siegfried Sassoon’s alter ego George Sherston pities some Welsh relieving troops:
<disp-quote>
<p>They were mostly undersized men, and as I watched them arriving at the first stage of their battle experience I had a sense of their victimisation. A little platoon officer was settling his men down with a valiant show of self-assurance. For the sake of appearances, orders of some kind had to be given, though in reality there was nothing to do except sit down and hope it wouldn’t rain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0968344512455977">42</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sassoon/Sherston also wonders about the gulf separating men from the officers who watch over them:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s queer, I thought, how little one really knows about the men. In the Line one finds out which are the duds, and one builds up a sort of comradeship with the tough and willing ones. But back in billets the gap widens and one can’t do much to cheer them up. I could never understand how they managed to keep as cheery as they did through such drudgery and discomfort,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0968344512455977">43</xref></sup> with nothing to look forward to but going over the top or being moved up to Flanders again.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0968344512455977">44</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We see here that the British officer’s natural consorts are ‘the tough and willing ones’, who thereby show qualities like those expected of the upper class; the mental state of the men en masse is so divergent from his own as to be incomprehensible. It is clearly a case of ‘them’, the men, and ‘us’, the officers.</p>
<p>The officer’s tasks include such paternal duties as ‘to cheer them up’, ‘settle them down’, and keep up ‘appearances’; the men are regarded as children. These paternal tasks are not always relished, for ‘though you pity your men more than yourself, it is difficult sometimes to be gentle with them, difficult not to yield to the intense exasperation of it all’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0968344512455977">45</xref></sup> Under war conditions Herbert’s young British Expeditionary Force officers discover ‘a true standard of right and wrong’, having previously, unlike their charges, had ‘no occasion to do anything dishonourable or underhand’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0968344512455977">46</xref></sup> or even awkward or distasteful. The subalterns coexist in ‘a strange tangle of friendship and animosity and good-nature and bitterness’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0968344512455977">47</xref></sup> that has little to do with any consideration of their men’s welfare; all their emotional energy is focused on their own class. The men, at least in their officers’ eyes, are of a class incapable of appreciating the finer aspects of life; as Sassoon notes, ‘the symbolism of the sunset was wasted on the rank and file, who were concerned with … the toils and troubles of keeping pace with what was required of them till further notice’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0968344512455977">48</xref></sup> To these officers, the men have no emotional or intellectual life worth mentioning. Even in Sassoon’s account, they appear dehumanized and expendable. They are indeed a class apart, even if not always physically far enough separated from their officers.</p>
<p>Herbert remarks that on Gallipoli, the British officer ‘had his own private hole, set democratically among the men’s’;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0968344512455977">49</xref></sup> indeed, ‘there was only a yard between the holes of the officers and the holes of the men, and their raucous quarrelling grated on nerves already sensitive from trials of the day, and the officer came near to cursing his own men; and that is bad’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0968344512455977">50</xref></sup> The distinction between classes is notable in many British works. Here the men are ‘raucous’ in comparison to the ‘sensitive’ officers; even so, the good officer is expected to tolerate his men’s under-bred behaviour with equanimity.</p>
<p>Class difference is of central importance in Rebecca West’s powerful, highly regarded <italic>Return of the Soldier</italic> (1918). Here, Chris Baldry’s wife, Kitty, and his cousin Jenny are discomposed to receive a visitor from nearby Wealdstone, ‘the red suburban stain which fouls the fields three miles nearer London than Harrowweald. One cannot now protect one’s environment as one once could.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0968344512455977">51</xref></sup> The visitor is a woman ‘repulsively furred with neglect and poverty’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0968344512455977">52</xref></sup> They ‘hated her as the rich hate the poor as insect things that will struggle out of the crannies which are their decent home and introduce ugliness to the light of day’, with her ‘wet, clear, patient gaze … the gift of animals and those of peasant stock’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0968344512455977">53</xref></sup> The women eventually ‘rescue’ Chris from lower-class Margaret, his first love, and assist him to overcome his loss of memory due to shell shock. Chris’s recovery enables him, horrifically, not only to remember the death of his infant son, but also to return to the killing fields of France. At this grave cost, he is rescued from an inappropriate liaison out of his own social class.</p>
<p>Australian authors too note the class-conscious flavour of the British army, as we saw previously in the words of Mitchell. McKinney’s protagonist John Fairbairn ‘was always surprised at the quivering delight Tommies seemed to take in saluting’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0968344512455977">54</xref></sup> Fairbairn rather patronisingly pities them, considering that their leadership has let them down:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Over-strained – and over-disciplined!’ thought John. Disciplined to the point of abjectness, until all sense of personal worth and initiative was crushed out of them; lorded over by half-baked schoolboys invested with the infallibility of gods and the dignity of potentates … bullied under a system that was as stupid and brutal as the old feudal one from which it had survived. That was all that was the matter with them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0968344512455977">55</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fuller asserts that it was exactly Britain’s long history of feudalism and its complementary culture of sceptical stoicism that served as ideal preparation for its troops to succeed in the specific and horrendous conditions of the Great War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0968344512455977">56</xref></sup> This supports Sheffield’s contentions, because certain expectations – for example that the men would have the worse of the conditions while the officers fared rather better but also had more responsibility – of the deferential bargain were met. Fuller contends that, even as the war progressed and the caste background of officers became more varied, there was no change in the dynamics of the officer–man relationship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0968344512455977">57</xref></sup> Sheffield’s deferential bargain helps to explain this: both soldiers and officers understood and complied with their assigned roles and the accompanying expectations with few questions.</p>
<p>A different implicit agreement operated between the Australians and their officers, an agreement invoking the explicit – if not always enacted – egalitarian notions of Australian society of the time, and one strongly distinct from the deferential structure of British society. In this egalitarian bargain, both sides of the officer–soldier relationship expected equality of regard – ‘man to man’ – and parity in effort and care.</p>
<p>Australian egalitarianism is not only approved by many Australian authors such as Mitchell and McKinney, it is also noted by many British writers. Frank Richards gives an account of fighting with the Australians at Polygon Wood. Richards was a member of the Second Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers, in which unit both Sassoon and Robert Graves served.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0968344512455977">58</xref></sup> Richards records his observations of the Australians after the battle, noting their camaraderie with their officers and the surprising presence of high rankers in the front line:
<disp-quote>
<p>The brigadier-general of the Australians had also arrived and was sorting his men out. It was the only time during the whole of the war that I saw a brigadier in the first line of attacking troops. Some brigadiers that I knew never moved from brigade headquarters. It was also the first time I had been in action with the Australians and I found them very brave men. There was also an excellent spirit of comradeship between officers and men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0968344512455977">59</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>R.H. Mottram, in his novel <italic>The Spanish Farm</italic> (1924), provides a portrait of Australians which takes for granted the unstratified relationship between the officers and the men, one not necessarily understood by the Europeans among whom they find themselves. The German push of spring 1918 brings the fighting very close to the farm and the chateau to which it owes allegiance. Australian troops descend upon the officially evacuated buildings, and while the baron imagines that ‘here are officers come to billet’ as only persons of such status would expect accommodation in his chateau, the heroine Madeleine, who has billeted many British and Dominion forces at the farm, ‘knew better. The Australian who had spoken was a Colonel, [but] the other two [were] privates’; she is not surprised at their informality when ‘the Colonel called over his shoulder, “Come on, boys!”’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0968344512455977">60</xref></sup> The colonel addresses his junior officers quite naturally by first name, and bows ‘as one unaccustomed’ to the baron<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0968344512455977">61</xref></sup> – unaccustomed, naturally enough, to old-world social forms, but equally unaccustomed to such formal recognition of social rank. Later, two visiting Australians surprise the British by their informality. Even though they have explained that they are brothers, the Englishman, Skene, expects more deference from the private: ‘Sam, the talkative one, whom Skene perceived to be an officer, walked on one side of him on their way to the billet, while Andy, the private, walked with no more ceremony on the other.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0968344512455977">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Australians in Mottram’s novels are known for ‘their splendid physique, their fine fighting qualities, and the tact needed to manage them behind the Line’:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0968344512455977">63</xref></sup> the requirement for ‘tact’ rather than official discipline indicates a distinct relationship, quite different from the British paternal/deferential arrangement. The egalitarian bargain proposed here as discernible in the literary artefacts was not a universal or mandated relationship. It was a notional expectation moderated by the men’s attitude to the war as work, their cultural assumptions of egalitarianism, and their status as volunteers.</p>
<p>The all-volunteer composition of the AIF meant that its leadership challenges were unique in the Great War. While all other armies subsumed citizen volunteers, the AIF was the only one never to have included conscripts. This status was well known to the troops and played a part in their superior self-conception.</p>
<p>Fuller discusses the nature of volunteering, demonstrating that it entails both benefits and disadvantages. Volunteering is transactional, because it implies a balance between giving and receiving: Fuller cites the poor disciplinary record of the AIF as proof that volunteering does not equal unquestioning obedience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0968344512455977">64</xref></sup> Grint goes further, considering free will, coercion, and reciprocity: there is a limit both to the extent of volition and to the agreement by subordinates to be/act as victims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0968344512455977">65</xref></sup> Walzer also contends that, despite superficial appearances, soldiers are never without individual volition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0968344512455977">66</xref></sup> The nature of volunteering brings specific challenges to those charged with organizing and directing the volunteers. Notwithstanding formal agreements, the volunteer, more than other soldiers, retains some sense of self-direction. This has evident implications for the officer–man relationship.</p>
<p>Australian volunteers expected the army to be organized, but they did not instinctively defer to those placed in superior positions purely on the strength of that position; their confidence in the leadership was premised on perceived competence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0968344512455977">67</xref></sup> They also expected limits to their own status as inferiors. That is, the AIF volunteers understood that they were in the army, a hierarchical organization, but they also believed that both they and the officers set above them would retain, and return to, their civilian positions after the war, and even out of the line. One British writer noted that when the Australians
<disp-quote>
<p>came out of the line they came like tired men who had finished a job of work; you would find them dropping independently, and sleeping by the roadside in twos and threes just as they fell. Then in the next day or so they would get up and stroll along and rejoin their units. But we had to come out like imitation Grenadier Guards, all in our proper fours and all rifles at the correct slope. They used to make public fun of us, and we used to hurl back insults at them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0968344512455977">68</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The AIF’s sporting contests between the men and their officers, for example, attest to a tradition of calling one another by their first name.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0968344512455977">69</xref></sup> Some men made little distinction between their officers and themselves either in or out of the line. Gammage provides numerous anecdotes of the informality of the Australians of 1915, remarking that, to Australians, ‘a salute signified respect for the recipient, not for the system, and they accorded respect willingly only to very exceptional men’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0968344512455977">70</xref></sup> Australians resented officers who traded too much on their rank, but respected those who treated them as equals: volunteer to volunteer, man to man; that is, citizen to citizen. There is no evidence that this citizen-to-citizen attitude was limited to ‘citizens’ (i.e. those entitled to vote; at the time, men under the age of 21 and indigenous men were in normal circumstances not legally full Australian citizens<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0968344512455977">71</xref></sup>); it was naturally extended to all who, by behaving as one of the group, proved themselves worthy.</p>
<p>The Australians responded to good leadership in the field but their general reputation for acquitting themselves with courage and application was counterbalanced by their reputation for poor behaviour away from the front. Out of the line, they respected those officers who enacted not the deferential bargain but the egalitarian one. They respected the officer who recognized that his rank gave him responsibility but did not make him, as an individual, either superior to or a better man than the private, nor give him paternal, especially authoritarian, rights over the private. Trespass of the egalitarian bargain helps to explain the men’s marked resentment of officers’ privileges just as well as does native insubordination or poor (self-) discipline per se. Many Australians out of the line considered themselves responsible only to themselves and did not respect curfews or appreciate mindless drill and polishing. It is clear from the historical record that Australian resentment of military drill surpassed that of other troops:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0968344512455977">72</xref></sup> ‘Coming from a country whose armed forces have always been relatively free from this element of militarism, [the Anzacs] were evidently so struck by the excessive spit and polish of the British Army that they felt moved to give it a label: “bullshit”.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0968344512455977">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>The strength of the Australians’ civilian individuality and their conception of themselves as differentiated from all other troops operated throughout the Great War. More than other combatant nations, they maintained their image of themselves as heroic actors in the farce of war, civilian volunteers who were up to the task but had no lasting wish to belong to the military. Their attitude remained one of scant tolerance for the army’s regulations while they undertook a necessary job, as opposed to an idealistic crusade against German militarism. The irreverent Australians, ‘if not charming visitors, [were] at least good companions for the work in hand’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0968344512455977">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the Great War all nations mobilized substantial citizen armies, a fundamental aspect of the American Civil War but something not seen on the European continent since classical days when one prerequisite of an Athenian citizen’s right to vote was his ability to defend the state in arms. While all armies struggled to recruit, train, and usefully deploy their non-regular army troops, the AIF was faced with a further challenge: the Australian volunteers, more than other troops, did not consider that they had signed over total control of their lives to the regular army. They had <italic>volunteered</italic>, for a task, for a cause, or simply for adventure. As Pugsley notes, if they had a wish to excel, it was self-generated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0968344512455977">75</xref></sup> Neither strict army discipline nor idealism formed the basis of the AIF’s dedication to duty or pride in achievement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0968344512455977">76</xref></sup> They were an army composed of citizens, not regular soldiers. Perhaps, though, an egalitarian bargain with trusted leaders formed part of the picture, in that it explains reciprocity in effort and care.</p>
<p>Janet Watson has written extensively on the different attitudes brought to the war by those who treated it as an ideal of service to king, country, democracy, and so on compared with those who conceived the war as ‘a job that had to be accomplished’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0968344512455977">77</xref></sup> Although a continuum of attitudes is discernible, the contrast between ‘service’ and ‘task’ at each end of the continuum is another useful lens for considering the attitudes to discipline underlying accounts of the Great War. Watson proposes that it is the idealistic who ‘were most likely to frame their memories as a story of disillusionment’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0968344512455977">78</xref></sup> Those who thought the war ‘a task, not a cause … saw no reason … to cooperate further with military activities and restrictions’ after the job was done.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0968344512455977">79</xref></sup> Watson is speaking of British troops, post-Armistice, but her comments could equally well apply to many Australians throughout the course of the war. The Australians portrayed by McKinney after the Armistice match the ‘task’ rather than ‘cause’ attitude: they ‘good-naturedly … humoured these [demobilization] futilities’ to an extent because they ‘were not really soldiers, certainly not in the army sense of the word. They were fighting men’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0968344512455977">80</xref></sup> maintaining their civilian status as working volunteers.</p>
<p>Watson contends that a ‘work’ attitude in which the war was a job to be undertaken with expectations of industrial-style organization contrasted with a ‘service’ attitude in which ideals were fought for and sacrifices were made for the greater good. Watson explicitly excludes the responses of non-English troops which she says need to be ‘situated in a contextualised study of their own’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0968344512455977">81</xref></sup> This paper goes some small way to contextualizing the Australian response.</p>
<p>The volunteering of idealistic young men for a high cause has been premised as the notion behind the strong enlistment figures early in the war. More highly educated and imaginative sections of the community had intellectual foundations based in classical literature and philosophy, and Fussell, Caesar, Leed, and others have explained how this background contributed to the representation of war as an epic experience invested with high ideals of selflessness and sacrifice. For British troops, it is convenient to separate the idealistic early volunteers from the reluctant conscripts of the war’s latter days, even when recognizing a continuum between the ‘work’ and ‘service’ extremes (for example, many men volunteered not for ideals but for higher pay and better conditions than they experienced in their usual employment; some conscripts subscribed strongly to the ‘truths’ of anti-German propaganda). What is important is that this volunteer/conscript division has no power when applied to Australian troops, a totally volunteer force.</p>
<p>Many factors influenced the decision to enlist, but if we entertain Watson’s notion that idealists were more likely to write disillusioned accounts than those who undertook their soldiering as a job, then we can only conclude that the writers of many Australian narratives had a ‘work’ attitude to the war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0968344512455977">82</xref></sup> These men had a surprisingly deep well of endurance for atrocious conditions not because they were prepared to forgo comfort for an ideal, or because they had expectations of feudal servility, but because they foresaw that the work would be dirty and dangerous. Further, they anticipated that their work would not always be successful. What is even more interesting is the Australian investment of purpose into activities that were demonstrably ineffective. The Anzac literature’s promotion of the war as worthwhile mirrors this attitude.</p>
<p>Conger and Kanungo’s 1988 model of leadership explains how followers who are empowered by their leaders can develop and maintain a belief in their own effectiveness even when they fail to achieve their goals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0968344512455977">83</xref></sup> Their belief in their own worth and productivity is not based solely on success. In other words, followers can invest in a self-belief that protects them from despair if they consider that, no matter the scale of the failure, they have performed well. Conger and Kanungo propose that leaders who delegate appropriately and operate in a meritocratic organization are more able to empower their subordinates in this way than are authoritarian leaders in a hierarchical organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0968344512455977">84</xref></sup> Applying this model to the Anzacs shows how their comparatively meritocratic organization and their cultural egalitarianism allowed them to develop a belief in their own effectiveness and worth which was not tied to positive outcomes. ‘We were often arrogant,’ confesses Mitchell.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0968344512455977">85</xref></sup> An unshaken belief in their own effectiveness, regardless of outcome, enabled these men to continue, just as the Tommies were sustained by sceptical stoicism.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, the much-criticized superiority complex of the Australians can be read as a self-protective device which enabled them to maintain pride in performance by such methods as comparing themselves over-favourably with their allies, scorning the higher leadership, and recognizing the difficulty of the context. Failure was not to be charged to their account, but elsewhere. Even when actions were proved futile, such actions were charged with a meaningful purpose as the Australians persuaded themselves that their efforts, too often quite painful and appallingly costly, were worthwhile; the failure was not their fault. No matter their opinion of headquarters or the war in general, the Anzacs’ self-concept of exceptional effectiveness remained largely unshaken.</p>
<p>Some historians proffer evidence of ill-discipline to argue that the relationship between the men of the AIF and their officers was not as egalitarian as popularly supposed. This reading is not entertained very generously in Australian prose accounts. Although in practice Australian society was/is not as egalitarian as its explicit values would indicate, nevertheless assumed egalitarianism explains the poor disciplinary record just as well as the notion of reciprocal paternalism/deference explains the relatively minor outbreaks of ill-discipline among the British troops. There is evidence that AIF soldiers, in a democratic understanding, revered and applauded those among them whom they saw as better fighters than themselves, regardless of rank or prior civilian status (for example, Captain Albert Jacka, VC, and ‘The Murderer’, Private Billy Sing, DCM). The egalitarian bargain, based on an individualistic and non-feudal culture, underpins this phenomenon too.</p>
<p>The feudal and complementary social stratification of the British deferential bargain did not operate for Australian troops, even for the quarter of AIF men who were British-born. Fuller explains that there were fewer British-born among the AIF than in the New Zealand or Canadian armies;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0968344512455977">86</xref></sup> this may be one factor explaining the AIF’s apparent greater distinction from other British and Dominion troops. The raw number of British-born is only one consideration in their possible influence on the force. We cannot be certain that British-born soldiers chose their destination colony impartially. It is more to the point to consider the make-up of the Australian-born population from which the majority of the AIF enlisted. The AIF was largely recruited from a migrant society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0968344512455977">87</xref></sup> At some stage, these men or their progenitors chose to leave the society in which they were raised to begin afresh on the other side of the world, or perhaps broke the deferential bargain and were transported. As well as those from British backgrounds, there were large numbers from non-English cultures, such as Australia’s substantial German Lutheran population (second only to the British in immigration numbers prior to the Great War), a large minority with an Irish Catholic background, and smaller numbers of other European ancestry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0968344512455977">88</xref></sup> The class-based deferential bargain had either been renounced by many of these families or was not part of their history. Even beyond taking into consideration the widely different ideals and values of the indigenous populations of the three countries, the composition of Australia’s migrant population differed from that of the populations of both Canada and New Zealand (which, for example, did not have convict settlers), and may help explain the abiding Australian scorn of army discipline and red tape.</p>
<p>The distinct Australian type engendered a distinct literary tradition. AIF stories reported ill-discipline without shame, even with a kind of pride, especially if they considered that the leadership had not treated them in a sufficiently egalitarian manner. Many examples of this, such as resentment at the privileges of officers, and complaints about officers’ shore leave on the voyage out, invest both the official histories and the narrative accounts.</p>
<p>The Australian literary tradition was largely a product of the dominating influence of the heroic Anzac legend that marginalized, rather than totally suppressed, other perspectives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0968344512455977">89</xref></sup> The Anzac in literature is likely to be more heroic than disenchanted, and in most cases quite as ill-disciplined as heroic: arguably, indifference to formal discipline is an aspect of Anzac heroism. This is not to say that the historical AIF did not include among its numbers men who were drifters, wasters, troublemakers, or the rough and ready attracted by the good pay rate, men who would never respect authority. They were undoubtedly one end of the scale, as the godly and teetotal were at the other. In between, as Andrews points out, most of the AIF were ‘simply decent honest men’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0968344512455977">90</xref></sup> who were remarkably reliable, willing, and persistent when in the front line.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0968344512455977">91</xref></sup> As ‘no other course [was] open to plain, honest men’ of the time than to fight,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0968344512455977">92</xref></sup> it is unsurprising that contemporary Australian manhood was represented by the Anzac. It is this decent honest Anzac, who has no patience with airs and graces, who is more a larrikin than a troublemaker, who inhabits Australian Great War literature and mythology.</p>
<p>Fairbairn’s batman in McKinney’s novel <italic>Crucible</italic> models the typical attitude:
<disp-quote>
<p>There was something refreshing about Snowey’s delightful obliviousness of the dignity of rank: a pure product of democracy, Snowey, with none of that assertive air of ‘Jack’s as good as his master’ (an assertion that always seemed to John to indicate the converse). Snowey’s manner quite unconsciously conveyed, not that he was as good as any man, but that any man was as good as he.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0968344512455977">93</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this portrait, McKinney captures the meritocratic Australian attitude to discipline with great insight. Any man may be good enough to be Snowey’s master, provided he is Snowey’s equal: accepted as one of the group, and not as a superior being, an elevated order of man too reliant on the them/us division.</p>
<p>The egalitarian assumptions of the relationship between officers and men contributed to the AIF’s disciplinary challenges. When considered alongside the Anzacs’ attitude focused more on tasks than ideals and their enduring self-conception as a citizen army, this essay’s proposed egalitarian bargain contributes a further strand to explanations of the differences between British and Australian attitudes to leadership and military discipline, both in the historical record and in the narrative accounts.</p>

<p>Many literary analyses proceed upon the premise that ‘Australian’ is a definable style and to a great degree a unified perspective (in the same way that some writers consider the ‘woman’s’ perspective of the Great War to be a single voice). Although in the interests of clarity of focus my comments in this essay subscribe somewhat to this view in describing differences between Australian and British Great War narratives, such works necessarily speak with multiple voices and perspectives and provide innumerable qualifications to the ideas presented in this essay. My analysis should be understood to refer most directly to selected mainstream prose narratives.</p>

However, each sentence so delivered could not be enacted without the express agreement of the Australian governor general, and this agreement, for a number of political and ethical reasons, was not forthcoming.</p></fn>

<p>Blair, <italic>Dinkum Diggers</italic>, pp. 53–4. Blair’s argument serves as a refutation of Australian egalitarianism and a qualification of the renowned goodwill between officers and men. However, he does not consider perceptions and his data address statistical evidence in isolation: for example, proving that the average height of Australian soldiers in one battalion was not significantly above that of a matched British battalion does not destroy the widespread stereotype of Australians as tall. Statistics rarely moderate perceptions.</p></fn>

The valuing of Artie Fethers as the best bomb-thrower in the platoon makes him a ‘decent coot’ because of his important role in the context of their job, not necessarily because of the special individual characteristics of his personality. Though in ‘more settled times’ Fethers may not have been chosen as a friend, in this instance the men go to some lengths to protect him from a deserved punishment because he is ‘one of them’, a valued member of the group.</p></fn>

<p>See C. Barnett, ‘A Military Historian’s View of the Great War Literature’, <italic>Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature</italic> XXXVI (1970), pp. 1–20. Barnett characterizes the British disenchantment writers as having had ‘an absurd upbringing … which gave them no knowledge or understanding of the real world of their time’ (p. 7), so that they were unable to comprehend the everyday squalor in which the majority of the contemporary lower socio-economic classes lived; therefore they attributed quite ordinary conditions (such as lice and the lack of bathing facilities) to the war, and considered features of the war which struck them as new and shocking (such as maiming and destruction of property and life) as specific to that war, whereas the longer historical view shows that such features are present in any war. Barnett’s discussion of the contemporary working and living conditions of the lower and working classes, compared with conditions in the Western Front trenches, is illuminating in this respect: official reports from the slums and factories of Britain detail conditions of pollution, crowding, physical danger, and lack of sanitation rivalling those of the front.</p></fn>

<p>However, Rosalie Triolo’s study of Victorian Education Department staff (‘“Our Schools and the War”: Victoria’s Education Department and the Great War, 1914–1918’, unpublished PhD thesis, Department of History, Monash University, Melbourne, 2008), almost all of whom were teachers, explores notions of social pressure, conservatism, and patriotism as inducements to enlistment in the First World War. These teacher-soldiers were better educated in a conservative imperial sense, more accustomed to hierarchy, and inculcated with patriotic notions, but even so the typical British duty and service ideals were not as strong in their writings as might be expected. Nevertheless, the arc of their experiences changing from euphemism and black humour early in the war to solemnity, misery and distress later in the war is evident in their letters. These Victorian teacher-soldiers are over-represented in mortality rate (21% compared with overall AIF 18%), commissions (30% officers; AIF 22%), and decorations (13%/ : /4%), so they may represent a specific type in the AIF mix which is more akin to the ‘better known idealistic young officers’ whom Watson describes as a vocal minority (<italic>Fighting Different Wars</italic>, p. 19).</p></fn>

<p>At least 300 indigenous men enlisted in the first AIF (of the total enlistment of 416,000). Three were decorated for gallantry, and the casualty rate was one in three, which is analogous to the rate across the AIF. There were no segregated units, and it is believed that the number of men of indigenous heritage who served in the Great War was greater than official figures are able to show, as ethnic background was not recorded. Also, some men claimed to be Maori or other ethnic background in order to retain their full pay, because in some states the Aboriginal Protectorate had control of earnings. R.A.
