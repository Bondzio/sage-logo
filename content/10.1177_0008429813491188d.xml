<p>Esler wonders how we should read Old Testament narrative. He challenges the dichotomy between the historical diachronic interpretation and the literary/aesthetic synchronic readings. He opts for what he calls “an integrated model of interpretation.” “My approach is historical in that it seeks to ascertain what these texts meant when they were produced or appeared in their current form at some point in the history of Israel, but this approach is also literary in paying close attention to the narratives as narratives, as story” (pp. 20–21). Scholars like V. Propp, A. J. Greimas, and Claude Lévi-Strauss have tried to identify story elements and story structures, and discovered that the same motifs and characters appear in myths and stories from a great variety of cultures. Esler is most impressed by the work of Christopher Booker, <italic>The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories</italic> (London: Continuum, 2004). Underlying the world’s stories are seven basic story-lines: “Overcoming the Monster,” “Rags and Riches,” “The Quest,” “Voyage and Return,” “Comedy,” “Tragedy,” and “Rebirth.” Stories, however, come from different cultures, and therefore Esler warns Western readers not to read these ancient narratives from their cultural background, but to undertake the historical task of investigating what biblical narratives, written in the setting of Ancient Israel, meant when they first appeared for the ancient audience. To obtain this, Esler uses the social sciences, especially cultural anthropology, including ethnography, of various Mediterranean peoples. He bases himself upon the works of several scholars, above all the Finnish anthropologist Hilma Granqvist, who conducted ethnographic research among certain Arab villagers in Palestine from 1925 to 1931. Profiting from this extensive research, Esler has set out a broad profile of the social context of ancient Israel. He describes first the material conditions: families and villages, and then what life was like for the people who lived in these houses and villages. These are the most important aspects: a strongly group-oriented culture; the values of honour and shame; challenge and response; limited good; patron and client relationships; patrilineality, patrilocality, and polygyny; and the broad socioeconomic and political structure of Ancient Israel: elite and non-elite.</p>
<p>After introducing the theory, Esler applies it to eight narratives, divided into three groups: Part 1 Wives: The story of Judah and Tamar (Gn 38); Hannah, Penninnah, and Elkanah (1 S 1–2). Part 2 Warriors: The madness of Saul, a warrior-king (1 S 8–31); David and Goliath (1 S 17:1–18:5); David, banditry and Kingship (1 S 19:1 to 2 S 5:5); “By the hand of a woman,” Judith the female warrior. Part 3 Sex: David, Bathsheba, and the Ammonite War (2 S 10–12); Dishonor avenged: Amnon, Tamar, and Absalom (2 S 13). Four of the essays were published before. Esler’s analysis is based upon the final form of the Masoretic Text; occasionally he refers to textual variants in the LXX. He illustrates how the social conditions of the Mediterranean give new insights into the text and how these narratives fall into the categories of the seven basic plots suggested by Booker.</p>
<p>Esler writes: “An interpretative method best justifies itself if it produces insights into a biblical text that go beyond the yield from existing scholarship” (p. 302). That is exactly what he has done: texts are seen in a new perspective and mysterious or offensive aspects of these narratives become more understandable. Readers and scholars familiar with these stories will discover things they never before saw. Esler is well informed; his extensive bibliography (pp. 361–383) covers the three important areas for this book: exegetical studies, studies on narrative, and on anthropology.</p>
<p>There is, however, a basic question. The studies on the Mediterranean culture are basically all from the last century, so how far does that culture now still correspond to the culture centuries before? In his analysis of the Amnon, Tamar, Absalom story (2 S 13), Esler describes the customs of the polygynous families in Palestine. A man who married more than one wife had to provide each wife separate sleeping quarters, and he adds: “this was required by Islamic law” (p. 326), but in the David family there seem to be other arrangements regarding who had his or her own house in the big family palace. In these Arab families there was a strong bond between full brothers and sisters, but relations with children of co-wives tended to be strained. A child in a polygynous family would refer to his father’s child from a co-wife, as “my father’s son.” That could explain the strong bond between the full siblings Tamar and Absalom, while Amnon, her half brother, only desires her but exhibits antipathy to her. Esler admits to himself: “It should be noted that it appears from the text before us that among the Israelites, unlike modern Palestinians, it was the custom for half siblings to refer to one another as ‘brother’ or ‘sister’” (p. 329). Whatever the answer may be to this specific basic question on how far modern Mediterranean culture is valid for the biblical stories, Esler’s work here does seem to apply in many cases and is enlightening. He himself remains prudent (he uses the phrases “possibly,” “probably,” “may have been” many times, for example on pp. 123-–126). Some of his statements are certainly open to disagreement: for instance, in the David and Bathsheba story, he describes David as the agent while Bathsheba is passive, “and speculation as to whether she counted on the possibility that David would see her while she was bathing seems wide of the mark” (p. 314).</p>
<p>The exterior presentation of the book is excellent; let me, however, note one rather amusing misprint. The well respected “Amsterdamse cahiers voor exegese van de Bijbel en zijn tradities” have become “Amsterdamse cashiers …” (p. 381). Esler has written an excellent and refreshing work that I highly recommend.</p>
