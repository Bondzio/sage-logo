<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 20-month-old female was referred for outpatient diagnostic evaluation of motor and speech delay. She was born at 39 weeks by induced vaginal delivery to a 35-year-old mother who had an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Prenatal ultrasounds were normal. In retrospect, her mother reported a perception of relatively decreased fetal movement compared with her first child. At birth she was appropriate size for gestational age and had an unremarkable perinatal course. She had a subsequent history of recurrent ear infections for which tympanostomy tubes were placed, but was otherwise healthy.</p>
<p>Gross motor and language milestones were delayed. She crawled at 12 months and walked at 19 months, and continued to have difficulty with balance. She inconsistently followed commands and spoke recognizable 3 words.</p>
<p>She had a 4-year-old brother who was developmentally normal. There was a maternal uncle with a mild learning disability. The family history was otherwise negative for intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, recurrent miscarriages, or congenital malformations. There was no history of consanguinity.</p>
<p>On physical exam at 20 months of age, she was 15th percentile for weight, 11th percentile for height, and 24th percentile for head circumference. She had mild synophrys with medial eyebrow flaring but no other dysmorphic features. The remainder of her physical exam was unremarkable. On neurological examination, she had mild hypotonia but normal strength and reflexes.</p>

<sec id="section2-0009922812460916">
<title>Clinical Course</title>
<p>The etiology of her developmental delay was felt to be a nonspecific central nervous system disorder. After discussion with her family, we sent Fragile X DNA testing and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chromosome microarray (CMA) following a referral for genetic counseling. During genetic counseling, it was specified that SNP array had the potential to reveal unexpected or unrelated information, as well as variants of unknown significance, which would require further parental testing.</p>
<p>SNP CMA subsequently revealed a 17.2 Mb deletion on the long arm of chromosome 5, from 5q21.1-q23.1. Parental genetic testing showed the deletion to be de novo. The large deletion encompassing more than 30 genes explained her global developmental delay as it is consistent with reports of other patients with a similar region of deletion who have intellectual disability or developmental delay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812460916">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812460916">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>This deletion included the <italic>APC</italic> gene, which is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis. There is an associated &gt;99% lifetime risk for developing colorectal cancer, as well as increased risk for multiple other cancers. Even though still a toddler, she will now require biannual screening abdominal ultrasounds and blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, and will eventually need a prophylactic colectomy in the future. She was referred to appropriate subspecialists for ongoing follow-up. These recommendations were discussed in detail with her family.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The rapid pace of technological advances in genomics has provided clinicians with powerful new diagnostic tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812460916">3</xref></sup> In 2010, the American College of Medical Genetics recommended CMA as a first tier diagnostic test for patients with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812460916">4</xref></sup> and these guidelines have been adopted by many professional societies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812460916">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812460916">6</xref></sup> Chromosomal microarray detects segmental gain or loss of chromosome material as small as 20 kilobases and has the highest diagnostic yield of any single genetic test and will result in a diagnosis 15% to 20% of the time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812460916">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is now increasingly ordered not only by geneticists but also by a wide range of clinicians including neurologists, pediatricians, and family physicians—who have varying understanding of test implications. Although a powerful diagnostic tool, CMA has the potential to reveal unexpected and/or uncertain information, as highlighted in the case presented above.</p>
<p>Generally, there are 3 possible result outcomes of CMA: normal, abnormal (pathogenic copy number variant), or a variant of unknown significance. This case highlights a fourth outcome—incidental but pathogenic findings not related to the original test indication. Incidental CMA findings include cancer susceptibility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812460916">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812460916">8</xref></sup> increased risk of adult-onset diseases such as schizophrenia or Alzheimer’s disease, and carrier status of recessive diseases. In particular, genetic variants yielding an increased cancer risk have been reported in 0.18% to 1.5% of all CMA testing, with the finding incidental 70% of the time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812460916">7</xref></sup> Incidental findings can also include previously undisclosed consanguinity, incest, or nonpaternity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812460916">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>For our patient, not only was the underlying cause for her delays established, but significant unforeseen long-term medical risks were also identified. In this situation, counseling requires knowledge and skill to convey this information effectively.</p>
<p>There are many advantages to determining a genetic etiology including improved prediction of prognosis and recurrence risk and tailored medical management. However, the possibility of incidental findings has additional ramifications that should be discussed with the patient and family prior to testing. Depending on the finding, a patient or family member might require ongoing screening, additional testing, new treatments, or change in management. Incidental findings have the potential to add anxiety in situations where there is no available treatment, screening, or where there is uncertainty regarding later risk. These findings can also affect other family members by revealing unexpected information about their own disease susceptibility.</p>
<p>Finally, while CMA has been shown to be cost-effective as a first-line test in global developmental delay,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812460916">10</xref></sup> it is an expensive diagnostic test and the cost may influence a family’s decision to pursue testing if it is not fully covered by insurance and is not likely to change medical management.</p>
<p>These possibilities underscore the importance of pretest counseling, including both anticipatory guidance and informed consent with proper documentation. Counseling sessions should include a simple explanation of the test and purpose, possible outcomes of testing including specific examples of incidental findings, and potential impact on the patient and family members. Genetic testing is not a routine laboratory test with clear normal and abnormal ranges. Practice guidelines suggest that ordering clinicians be familiar with limits of genetic testing and understand the need for follow-up with the patient and family. Extensive discussion between providers, patients, and families is required for families to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>While geneticists and genetic counselors effectively counsel families, they are often not available since CMA may be ordered before or concurrent with a referral to a genetics center. In these situations it is the ordering clinician’s responsibility to thoroughly counsel the family before and after any genetic testing is performed. To address this, better educational opportunities should be offered to nongenetic clinicians to ensure appropriate counseling to families on potential findings, both expected and unexpected. Training can be supplemented by providing creative tools and educational materials to share with families.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as knowledge of the genetic contributions to neurodevelopmental disabilities and other diseases grows, technology for diagnostic testing will continue to expand. This is evidenced by the recent introduction of whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing for use in clinical diagnostics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812460916">11</xref></sup> There will likely not be enough genetics specialists to meet the clinical demand, underscoring the importance of training clinicians who will order these tests with skills for counseling and patient education.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This cautionary tale of our patient is a compelling reminder that genetic results can have long-term implications beyond the original test indication. The parents of our patient came to us looking for an explanation for her developmental delay and left with a life-changing diagnosis of almost certain cancer. As genetic test results may have medical, ethical, legal, and psychosocial impact on patients and their families, it is crucial that they are prepared ahead of time for possible outcomes, enabling them to make informed decisions on whether and how to proceed with testing. Pretest genetic counseling provided by well-versed clinicians or genetic counselors should be standard of care and will increasingly be the responsibility of nongenetic professionals.</p>
