<p><bold>Aim:</bold> Non-invasive measures of atherosclerosis, such as carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), may improve global cardiovascular risk prediction. The aim of this study was to determine whether common carotid IMT in addition to traditional risk factors improves risk classification in a general population of older people.</p>
<p><bold>Methods and results:</bold> A group of 3580 non-diabetic people aged 55–75 years and free of cardiovascular disease at baseline were followed for a median time of 12.2 years. Compared to models based on Framingham risk factors, we studied the ability of common cIMT measurement to better classify people into categories of low (&lt;10%), intermediate (10–20%) and high (&gt;20%) 10-year risk of hard coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. In older men, addition of cIMT to Framingham risk factors did not improve prediction of hard CHD or stroke. In older women, addition of cIMT to Framingham risk factors significantly improved risk classification. cIMT improved the C-statistic of the model for hard CHD from 0.711 to 0.719 and for stroke from 0.712 to 0.721, at good calibration. Reclassification was least in the majority of women classified as low risk (4% (<italic>n </italic>= 76) for hard CHD and 3% (<italic>n </italic>= 62) for stroke) and most substantial in women at intermediate risk (43% (<italic>n </italic>= 70) for hard CHD and 28% (<italic>n </italic>= 76) for stroke). The net reclassification improvement in women was 8.2% (<italic>p </italic>= 0.03) for hard CHD and 8.0% (<italic>p </italic>= 0.06) for stroke.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> cIMT had some additional value beyond traditional risk factors in the cardiovascular risk stratification of older women, but not of older men.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711414623" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of morbidity and premature death in the Western world. The underlying atherosclerosis develops over many years and symptoms usually do not occur until the disease is already at an advanced stage. The majority of CVD is related to modifiable risk factors and modification of these factors has been shown to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711414623">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current, clinically accepted concept of matching treatment intensity to the degree of cardiovascular risk suggests that it is important to identify the most accurate approach to risk stratification as a solid base for the best treatment strategies in people at risk of CVD. In accordance with current guidelines, global risk factor assessment using algorithms such as the SCORE risk chart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711414623">2</xref></sup> or Framingham Risk Score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711414623">3</xref></sup> are increasingly used to stratify people in categories of low, intermediate and high risk, based on 10-year absolute risk of CVD or coronary heart disease (CHD). However, these risk factor algorithms are of limited accuracy, especially in women and the elderly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711414623">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711414623">5</xref></sup> To improve risk stratification, expert panels have proposed non-invasive measures predicting atherosclerotic disease, such as carotid intima-media measurement (cIMT), as a second step after risk stratification based on traditional risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711414623">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711414623">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711414623">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711414623">7</xref></sup> Research has shown that the addition of a cIMT measurement to established risk factors led to small and sometimes significant improvements in cardiovascular risk prediction by means of increases in the C-statistic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711414623">8</xref></sup> However, in the evaluation of the clinical value of a new test, it is important to assess the reclassification of individuals into different risk categories when the new test is added to traditional risk factors;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711414623">9</xref></sup> to date limited research has addressed this issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711414623">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711414623">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the population-based Rotterdam study, we stratified non-diabetic men and women of 55–75 years who were free of CVD at baseline into three widely used clinical risk categories of low (&lt;10%), intermediate (10–20%) and high (&gt;20%) 10-year risk of hard CHD and stroke based on Framingham risk factors and studied the ability of common cIMT to reclassify people to a more accurate risk category.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741826711414623"><title>Study population</title>
<p>The study was embedded in the Rotterdam Study, which is a prospective, population-based study among subjects aged 55 years and older in a municipality of Rotterdam that started in 1990. The rationale and design of the Rotterdam Study has been described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711414623">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711414623">13</xref></sup> The baseline examination took place from 1990 to 1993. Of the 7983 participants (response rate 78%), 5643 underwent a common cIMT measurement. Missing cIMT measurements were due to restricted availability of ultrasonographers. In line with current guidelines for cardiovascular screening,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711414623">3</xref></sup> we excluded people of 75 years and older (<italic>n </italic>= 1302) and people already defined as being at high cardiovascular risk based on having diabetes (<italic>N </italic>= 431) or established cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline (<italic>N </italic>= 330). Prevalent CVD was defined as a history of clinically manifest myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, stroke, symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD), aortic or carotid surgery. Hence, the current analysis was carried out in 3580 asymptomatic individuals. The Medical Ethics Committee of Erasmus Medical Center approved the study, and all participants gave informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711414623"><title>Common carotid IMT measurement</title>
<p>Ultrasonography of both carotid arteries was performed with a 7.5 MHz linear-array transducer and a duplex scanner (ATL UltraMark IV; Advanced Technology Laboratories). Measurements of the common carotid artery (CCA) intima-media thickness involved a length of 10 mm distal of the bulb. cIMT was determined as the average of mean, near- and far-wall IMT, providing the average of left and right common carotid IMT. The procedure has been described in detail previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711414623">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711414623"><title>Cardiovascular risk factors</title>
<p>Information on cardiovascular risk factors was acquired during the baseline examination as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711414623">15</xref></sup> Diabetes was defined as a non-fasting glucose &gt; 11 mmol/l and/or use of anti-diabetic medication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711414623"><title>Clinical outcomes</title>
<p>The follow-up procedures of the Rotterdam Study have been reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711414623">15</xref></sup> None of the people considered for analysis was lost to follow up. As outcome we used hard CHD, consisting of incident myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary heart disease mortality and stroke, which included ischaemic stroke (mortality). If a person died within 4 weeks of an MI or ischaemic stroke, events were coded as fatal. Follow up was completed by January 2005.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711414623"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711414623"><title>Common carotid IMT and risk of CVD</title>
<p>We used Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of a 1-standard deviation increase of cIMT to predict hard CHD and stroke for the total population and as well as stratified by gender. In the analysis, we corrected for age and, if appropriate, gender. We additionally adjusted for current smoking, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and use of antihypertensive medication and for atrial fibrillation for the outcome stroke. We used log minus log plots to check for proportionality of hazards over time and found no indications of violation of the proportionality assumption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741826711414623"><title>Risk prediction models</title>
<p>We used Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to derive estimates of individual 10-year risk of hard CHD and stroke. Analyses were performed by gender. For the outcome hard CHD, we used the same predictors as defined in the Framingham risk score, in accordance with the ATP III guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711414623">3</xref></sup> The model thus included age, gender, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive medication, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and current smoking (model 1). For the outcome stroke, model 1 also included atrial fibrillation, in line with the Framingham stroke risk score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711414623">16</xref></sup> In a second step, we extended model 1 with common cIMT (model 2). Both models were fitted to the gender-specific subsets of the Rotterdam Study data. We used restricted cubic spline transformations with four knots for continuous variables in the models, four knots being a good compromise between flexibility and loss of precision caused by over-fitting of the model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711414623">17</xref></sup> We used the likelihood ratio test to study the null-hypothesis of no effect of common cIMT to predict hard CHD and stroke beyond Framingham risk predictors. To examine the discriminative ability of the two models, we calculated the bootstrap corrected C-statistic using 150 repetitions for both gender-specific models. The purpose of using the bootstrap method is to correct for over-optimism of the fitted models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711414623">18</xref></sup> Next, we computed reclassification percentages to study the incremental ability of common carotid IMT to classify subjects in risk categories according to commonly used categories of 10-year hard CHD and stroke risk: low (&lt;10%), intermediate (10–20%), and high risk (&gt;20%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711414623">3</xref></sup> Observed 10-year risk of CVD was estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for each cell of the reclassification table to show calibration of reclassified people with observed risk. To evaluate true improvement in classification by addition of common cIMT to the Framingham model we calculated the net reclassification improvement (NRI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711414623">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In secondary analyses, we repeated the prediction analyses using the mean of the maximum of IMT values of near and far walls of both common carotid arteries as a determinant instead of the mean of the mean IMT values.</p>
<p>Covariables were missing in less than 2% of people. We used single imputation by the Expectation Maximization method. All analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) and R version 2.7.2. (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p>

<p>For the risk of hard CHD, the age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for a 1-standard deviation increase in common cIMT in the total population was 1.26 (1.13–1.41) and decreased to 1.16 (1.03–1.30) after additional adjustment for the remaining cardiovascular risk factors. Corresponding risks of stroke were: 1.33 (1.18–1.50) and 1.25 (1.10–1.42). In gender-specific subsets, the analogous hazard ratios for the outcome hard CHD were 1.08 (0.92–1.27) and 1.02 (0.86–1.20) in men and 1.56 (1.34–1.81) and 1.40 (1.19–1.65) in women. For stroke outcome, corresponding hazard ratios were 1.28 (1.07–1.54) and 1.18 (0.97–1.43) in men and 1.38 (1.18–1.62) and 1.32 (1.12–1.56) in women.</p>
<p>In hard CHD risk prediction in men, addition of common cIMT did not improve model performance of the refitted Framingham risk model. The likelihood chi-square of model 2 did not significantly increase compared to model 1 (<italic>p </italic>= 0.84). Hence, the C-statistic did not improve by addition of cIMT: 0.611 (model 1) and 0.610 (model 2). In contrast, addition of common cIMT significantly improved model performance in women. The likelihood chi-square increased by 15.2 points (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001). The C-statistic improved from 0.711 to 0.719, indicating slightly better average discriminative ability of the model including cIMT.</p>
<p>In stroke risk prediction in men, addition of common cIMT did not improve model performance of the refitted Framingham risk model. The likelihood chi-square did not significantly increase (<italic>p </italic>= 0.11), the C-statistic slightly improved by addition of cIMT from 0.692 (model 1) to 0.698 (model 2). In women, the likelihood chi-square increased by 10.0 points (<italic>p </italic>= 0.002). The C-statistic improved from 0.712 to 0.721.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711414623">Table 2</xref> displays categories of estimated 10-year hard CHD risk based on the Framingham risk model before and after adding common cIMT in men and women. In men, percentages in the low, intermediate and high-risk categories were 53%, 43% and 4%, respectively. For women these percentages were 92%, 7% and 1%. In accordance with the finding that addition of cIMT did not improve the C-statistic of the Framingham risk model, additional cIMT measurements led to hardly any reclassification. Correspondingly, the net reclassification improvement (NRI) was 0.21% (<italic>p </italic>= 0.50)). In women, additional cIMT measurement led to more reclassification. Of women at low risk, 4% (<italic>n </italic>= 73) of people reclassified to the intermediate risk category and three people to high risk.

Of women at high risk, 29% (<italic>n </italic>= 4) were downgraded to the intermediate risk category. Addition of common cIMT in women led to a net gain in reclassification of 9.1% in people with an event and a net decline in reclassification of 0.9% in people without event, resulting in a NRI of 9.1–0.9 = 8.2% (<italic>p </italic>= 0.03).

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711414623">Table 3</xref> displays categories of estimated 10-year stroke risk based on the Framingham risk model before and after adding common cIMT in men and women for the outcome of stroke. In men, percentages in the low, intermediate and high-risk categories were 85%, 13% and 2%, respectively. For women corresponding percentages were 87%, 12% and 1%. In men, more reclassification was observed compared with the outcome of stroke. However, this was not clinically significant, by means of the NRI (3.9%; <italic>p </italic>= 0.16).

Of women at high risk, 37% (<italic>n </italic>= 10) were downgraded to the intermediate risk category.

<p>This population-based study shows that the addition of common cIMT measurement to the Framingham risk model does not significantly improve the risk prediction of hard CHD and stroke in older men and only modestly improves risk classification for these outcomes in older women. Most substantial reclassification was observed in women classified as intermediate risk based on traditional risk factors. Of the women classified as being at intermediate risk for hard CHD (7% of all women), cIMT measurement reclassified 35% of people to low and 8% to high-risk categories. The net reclassification improvement was 8.2% (<italic>p </italic>= 0.03). Of the women classified as being at intermediate risk for stroke (12% of all women), cIMT measurement reclassified 19% of people to low and 9% to high-risk categories. The net reclassification improvement was 8% (<italic>p </italic>= 0.06).</p>
<sec id="sec12-1741826711414623"><title>CIMT and future cardiovascular disease</title>
<p>An essential prerequisite for the use of cIMT in cardiovascular risk stratification is its ability to predict future cardiovascular events. A meta-analysis by Lorenz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711414623">20</xref></sup> comprising eight large, longitudinal population-based cohort studies showed that common cIMT is a strong predictor of MI and stroke in the total population. The overall age- and gender-adjusted estimates of relative risk per a 1-standard deviation increase of cIMT reported in this meta-analyses were 1.26 (1.21–1.30) for MI and 1.18 (1.16–1.21) for stroke. In line with these results, the corresponding estimates we found for hard CHD and stroke risk in the total population were 1.26 (1.13–1.41) and 1.33 (1.18–1.50). We found that associations were stronger in women than in men. All associations were attenuated by additional adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1741826711414623"><title>Additional value of cIMT in cardiovascular risk prediction</title>
<p>The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711414623">10</xref></sup> recently reported on the additional value of cIMT and plaque beyond traditional risk factors in the 10-year risk prediction of CHD. In contrast to our results, this study found a higher additional value of cIMT in men than in women. The addition of cIMT beyond traditional risk factors resulted in a significant increase in C-statistic from 0.742 to 0.750 in men and a non-significant increase from 0.759 to 0.762 in women. The NRI was 8.9 (3.4–15.1) for men and 6.1 (-2.3–9.4). Unfortunately, reclassification percentages for addition of cIMT were not presented. The discrepancy in results between the ARIC and our study might be explained at least partly by the fact that their study population was younger (mean age 54 versus 65 years). Since IMT is thought to represent an early stage of atherosclerosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711414623">21</xref></sup> it may be possible that the additional value of IMT diminishes with advancing stages of atherosclerosis, which would particularly affect older men. Another possible explanation for not finding an additional value of IMT in older men might be that people prone to the effects of atherosclerosis already died before study inclusion or developed a cardiovascular event that was one of the exclusion criteria of our study. Since men develop atherosclerosis at an earlier age than women, this selection would have greater impact on our male than on our female study population. Differences in results might also be related to the fact that the ARIC study used total CHD as an outcome, which included revascularizations and silent MI while we studied hard CHD only. Both studies calculated the mean cIMT of near and far wall and measured IMT in the distal common carotid artery (CCA). However, in extent, the ARIC study also took the IMT in the carotid artery bifurcation and the proximal internal carotid arteries into account. Despite the differences in results between the two studies, it is of note that in both the ARIC and our study the observed additional value of IMT seems to be modest. A recent publication by the Carotid Atherosclerosis Progression Study (CAPS) group reported that in 4904 individuals free of CVD at baseline (mean age 50 years, 48% male), carotid intima media thickness was significantly and independently predictive for cardiovascular events. However, for the outcome of myocardial infarction, addition of common cIMT to a model using the Framingham risk factors led to a small increase in C-statistic from 0.732 to 0.741 and only 25 people (0.6%) were reclassified. The net reclassification improvement was 0.14% (<italic>p</italic> = NS). Analyses including other endpoint definitions (angina/MI/all-cause mortality), other carotid segments (carotid bifurcation/internal carotid artery), and the SCORE risk model for baseline prediction did not result in consistently better risk prediction with cIMT. The fact that the mean age and thereby the mean cIMT (0.72 mm) was relatively low might have played a role in the negative findings. Furthermore, the assessment of clinical events was based on health insurance data and questionnaires that could have led to misclassification of the outcome and underestimation of the additional effect of cIMT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711414623">11</xref></sup> A systematic review of studies in people free from CVD reported that the addition of a cIMT measurement to established risk factors led to small and sometimes significant improvements in cardiovascular risk prediction by means of increases in the C-statistic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711414623">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The number of women upgraded in risk exceeded that of women downgraded in risk – 4.0% (<italic>n </italic>= 89) versus 2.8% (<italic>n </italic>= 61) for hard CHD and 2.0 % (<italic>n </italic>= 43) versus 1.4% (<italic>n </italic>= 31) for stroke (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711414623">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711414623">3</xref>). This suggests that the addition of cIMT measurement would lead to more women needing to receive medical therapy according to current prevention guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711414623">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711414623">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the well-established association between cIMT and risk of future CHD and stroke, accruing evidence indicates at best a modest benefit of additional cIMT in the prediction of cardiovascular disease.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1741826711414623"><title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>In order to appreciate the results, the strengths and limitations of the present study need to be considered. Strengths of our study include a large population-based cohort, in whom standardized measurements of risk factors and common cIMT measurement are performed. Furthermore, the complete and long follow-up has generated a large number of events enabling us to use hard events as an outcome and separate the analyses by gender. However, some limitations also need to be addressed. Firstly, while previous research within the Rotterdam study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711414623">22</xref></sup> showed that application of the Framingham Risk Score led to systematic overestimation of CHD risk in men, we chose to fit a model based on Framingham risk factors to stratify our population in the well-known risk categories. A potential drawback is over-fitting of the model, which could lead to underestimation of the additional value of cIMT measurement. However, all C-statistics were corrected for over-fitting using the bootstrap method. Secondly, we used the mean of mean IMT values of near and far walls of both common carotid arteries in our analyses. However, when we used the mean of the maximal cIMT values of near and far walls, reclassification percentages and NRI values did not change substantially (data not shown). Thirdly, since usage of risk-modifying therapy other than antihypertensive medication is not accounted for in the Framingham risk model, the cardiovascular risk of people on this treatment might have been overestimated. However, at baseline few people used cholesterol-lowering medication or antithrombotic therapy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711414623">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, it is not likely that usage of these agents will have biased our results.</p>
<p>Finally, our study was performed in older people. The predictive power of traditional cardiovascular risk factors decreases with age while increased cIMT can be seen as a cumulative measure of the effect of lifetime exposure to cardiovascular risk factors on the arterial vessel wall and may therefore improve risk stratification particularly at older age. This implies that our results should not automatically be generalized to a younger population.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1741826711414623" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Despite a well-established association between cIMT and risk of future CVD events, the additional predictive value of a cIMT measurement within clinical risk categories based on traditional risk factors seems to be limited. In older men, common cIMT measurement did not significantly improve risk stratification based on traditional risk factors. In older women, common cIMT showed a modest ability to reclassify people to a more accurate cardiovascular risk category.</p>
