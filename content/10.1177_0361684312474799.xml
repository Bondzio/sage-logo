<abstract>
<p>The purpose of our study was to extend tenets of objectification theory to a sample of 278 undergraduate African American women. We hypothesized that internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes would moderate the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and internalized sociocultural standards of beauty, which would then correlate with less body surveillance. In turn, we predicted that less body surveillance would be associated with less body shame, appearance anxiety, and greater interoceptive awareness, which would likely be associated with decreased eating disordered behaviors. A moderated mediation analysis supported the overall model, suggesting that internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes buffer against sexually objectifying experiences. When sexually objectifying experiences were high and internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes were low, participants were more likely to internalize dominant standards of beauty, which was then associated with increased body surveillance, body shame, appearance anxiety, disordered eating, and poorer interoceptive awareness. Interventions aimed to assist African American women develop a positive race salience and challenge sociocultural standards of beauty seem warranted in order to diminish body image concerns and disordered eating.</p>

<body>
<p>Although disordered eating may have multiple etiologies, a sociocultural context that reduces women to their bodies and sexual functioning (i.e., sexual objectification) is linked to body image and eating disturbances among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684312474799">Engeln-Maddox, 2006</xref>). Such experiences may radically alter the ways that women view and treat their bodies, and accordingly, their eating behaviors. Historically, some racial groups, particularly African American women, were considered immune to eating disturbances due to standards of beauty that emphasize shapeliness over the thin ideal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684312474799">Gordon, Castro, Sitnikov, &amp; Holm-Denoma, 2010</xref>). Indeed, African American women have been found to possess less body dissatisfaction, diet less frequently, and have lower rates of disordered eating than White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312474799">Grabe &amp; Hyde, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, recent meta-analyses have revealed marginal differences between Black and White women in disordered eating prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312474799">Grabe &amp; Hyde, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684312474799">Roberts, Cash, Feingold, &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>), suggesting that diverse groups of women may be susceptible to body image concerns and eating disturbances, particularly when the Western thin ideal is internalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684312474799">Jefferson &amp; Stake, 2009</xref>). In fact, researchers have found that African American women who have internalized Western standards of beauty endorse more eating disordered symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0361684312474799">Gilbert, Crump, Madhere, &amp; Schutz, 2009</xref>). Conversely, other research has suggested that internalization of the thin ideal does not predict eating disordered behaviors in African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684312474799">Lester &amp; Petrie, 1998</xref>). These inconclusive findings suggest that there is no dominant pattern of disordered eating among African American women, and therefore researchers need to identify specific factors that might explain this heterogeneity.</p>
<sec id="section1-0361684312474799">
<title>Objectification Theory and African American Women</title>
<p>Objectification theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0361684312474799">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>) provides a unique lens for understanding how eating disordered behaviors may develop among women. Objectification theory posits that women may internalize routine and persistent sexual objectification experiences and then begin to view and treat themselves as objects to be looked at and evaluated; this process is termed self-objectification. Self-objectification, often measured via body surveillance (i.e., when women think about their body in terms of how it looks vs. how it feels), was believed to result in a number of harmful psychological consequences—including body shame, appearance anxiety, decreased flow (i.e., the ability to be fully engaged and present in a given task), and decreased interoceptive awareness (i.e., a muted awareness of internal physiological and emotional states). These consequences, in turn, were espoused to converge and result in common psychological disturbances seen among women—including depression, eating disordered behaviors, and decreased psychosexual functioning.</p>
<p>Empirical research has largely validated Fredrickson and Robert’s (1997) model. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0361684312474799">Moradi, Dirks, and Matteson (2005)</xref> found that sexually objectifying experiences directly predicted body surveillance, but were indirectly related to body surveillance (partial mediation), body shame, and disordered eating through the internalization of sociocultural standards of beauty. In addition, associations between internalized dominant standards of beauty and appearance anxiety have been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684312474799">Halliwell &amp; Dittmar, 2004</xref>). Other research has suggested that body surveillance is related to body shame and decreased interoceptive awareness, which in turn are associated with increased disordered eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0361684312474799">Tylka &amp; Hill, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, research has suggested that body shame predicts poorer interoceptive awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684312474799">Kozee &amp; Tylka, 2006</xref>) and appearance anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684312474799">Tiggemann &amp; Williams, 2012</xref>) and that appearance anxiety mediates the relationship between body surveillance and eating disordered symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684312474799">Slater &amp; Tiggemann, 2010</xref>). It is important to denote that the aforementioned studies primarily recruited White participants, and therefore more information about the relationships among objectification theory variables is sorely needed for diverse groups of women, including African American women.</p>
<p>Comparisons between White and African American women have been made on objectification theory constructs. Research has found that body surveillance predicted sexual risk-taking behaviors and body shame among both White and African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0361684312474799">Watson, Matheny, Gagne, Brack, &amp; Ancis, 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312474799">Mitchell and Mazzeo (2009)</xref> postulated that both sexual objectification and internalized standards of beauty would relate to disordered eating via body monitoring, body dissatisfaction, anxiety, and depression among both White and African American women. Although the model was fairly similar for both groups of women, the link between depression and eating disordered behaviors was nonsignificant for African American women, but significant for European American women. Together, these findings suggest that objectification theory variables may operate in similar ways among African American participants, such that sexually objectifying experiences and the internalization of the thin ideal are linked with body image disturbances and disordered eating.</p>
<p>Although prior research suggests some similarities between White and African American women in terms of the ways that objectification theory variables may relate, most of these studies are limited in that they have merely compared White and African American participants, as opposed to integrating culturally salient variables. An exception is a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684312474799">Buchanan, Fischer, Tokar, and Yoder (2008)</xref>, which extended tenets of objectification theory to African American women by examining the roles of skin-tone monitoring and skin-tone dissatisfaction. They found that skin-tone monitoring was associated with increased skin-tone dissatisfaction and overall body dissatisfaction, but the relationship between these variables was not mediated by self-objectification (i.e., measured via the self-objectification questionnaire [SOQ], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684312474799">Noll &amp; Fredrickson, 1998</xref>), as was initially hypothesized. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684312474799">Watson, Robinson, Dispenza, and Nazari (2012)</xref> conducted a qualitative study investigating African American women’s experiences with sexual objectification. Participants described how their sexual objectification is based upon historical race, gender, and class oppression, which continues to reverberate in current culture and uniquely affects their experiences with sexual objectification. In essence, direct comparisons of White and African American women on objectification theory variables reveal some similarities, but studies focusing exclusively on African American women suggest specific factors that pertain to their sexual objectification.</p>

<title>Racial Identity and Disordered Eating</title>
<p>In order to fully understand the impact of sexism in African American women’s lives, it is also important to consider the ways in which interacting forms of oppression may shape African American women’s experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0361684312474799">Hill Collins (2009)</xref> explained that African American women’s experiences are shaped by interacting systems of oppression based on race, gender, and class. In fact, research has suggested that race- and gender-related stress interact and relate to psychological distress among African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684312474799">Szymanski &amp; Stewart, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0361684312474799">Woods-Giscombé &amp; Lobel, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, research has supported the notion that identity-related attitudes may moderate the relationship between oppressive experiences and mental health outcomes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684312474799">Sabik and Tylka (2006)</xref> found that feminist identity attitudes mitigated the relationship between perceived sexist events and disordered eating.</p>
<p>Although race- and gender-related stress may correlate with psychological distress among African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684312474799">Szymanski &amp; Stewart, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0361684312474799">Woods-Giscombé &amp; Lobel, 2008</xref>), research has also suggested that a positive and affirming racial identity may buffer against the effects of racism and sexism, particularly when it comes to body image and disordered eating. One study suggested that positive feelings about one’s racial group are a protective factor, thereby weakening the relationship between body dissatisfaction and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0361684312474799">Oney, Cole, &amp; Sellers, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684312474799">Shuttlesworth and Zotter (2011)</xref> found that, compared to White women, African American women who were more accepting, affirming, and strongly identified with their ethnic identity had lower rates of anorexic behaviors, binge eating, and bulimia. Moreover, research has suggested that African American women who identify with other racial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684312474799">Harris, 1995</xref>) or ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684312474799">Henrickson, Crowther, &amp; Harrington, 2010</xref>) and are less affirming of their own are more likely to possess maladaptive eating attitudes and behaviors. In sum, extant research has revealed that African American women who are more affirming and accepting of their Black identity tend to be more satisfied with their body image and report fewer eating disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684312474799">Harris, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In an effort to further understand racial identity as a buffer against the effects of sexual objectification, it may be helpful to conceptualize racial identity via <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312474799">Cross’s (1971)</xref> Nigrescence theory. This theory was initially developed to describe the number of psychological responses to systematic oppression among African Americans. Specifically, Cross devised several different stages or identity statuses in order to encompass these psychological processes. The Pre-Encounter Assimilation (PA) stage is often characterized by those who wish to be viewed as Americans, and whose race is not a particularly salient aspect of their identity. The Pre-Encounter Miseducation (PM) stage is characterized by internalized negative Black stereotypes, whereas the Pre-Encounter Self-Hatred (PSH) stage is distinguished by negative feelings about being Black. Individuals in the Immersion/Emersion Anti-White (IEAW) stage have typically encountered an experience that challenges their reference group orientation, such as an experience of racism that often results in an acknowledgment of racism within their lives. As a result of these oppressive experiences, individuals may experience a high degree of affiliation with Black culture and possess anti-White attitudes. The following stage is the Internalization Afrocentric (IA), distinguished by one’s tendency to see and think about things from an Afrocentric view. Finally, the multicultural stage focuses on affirmation of one’s Black identity and the identities of others. In essence, each stage moves from a place of Black rejection to Black affirmation, as well as toward a feeling of connection to members of other oppressed groups.</p>
<p>In addition to findings suggesting that an affirming racial identity may buffer against body dissatisfaction, research has demonstrated that a more affirming racial identity may attenuate the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and the internalization of the thin ideal. A qualitative study investigating African American women’s experiences at a predominantly White university revealed that African American women who identified as “Black and proud,” or were from racially diverse communities, did not internalize the Western thin ideal as much as those who identified with White culture, or who vacillated in their identification with White and Black culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684312474799">Hesse-Biber, Livingstone, Ramirez, Barko, &amp; Johnson, 2010</xref>). In addition, African American women who have internalized negative stereotypes regarding their race and are less affirming of their Black identity tend to be more likely to internalize White standards of beauty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684312474799">Rogers Wood &amp; Petrie, 2010</xref>) and engage in eating disordered behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684312474799">Henrickson et al., 2010</xref>). These findings suggest that an affirming racial identity may moderate the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and internalization of Western standards of beauty.</p>

<sec id="section3-0361684312474799">
<title>Multiculturally Inclusive Racial Identity Attitudes</title>
<p>In conducting our study, we were particularly interested in understanding the role that internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes may play in the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and an internalized thin ideal. We chose to focus on this identity schema as opposed to the other identity schemas identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312474799">Cross’s (1971)</xref> model because it more fully captured the construct we sought to explore; that is, we were interested in exploring how an affirmation of one’s race and a multicultural perspective may buffer against sexually objectifying experiences and weaken the link to the internalization of the thin ideal. Because African American individuals who have internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes tend to be more accepting and affirming of their Black identity, these women may be less likely to internalize dominant standards of beauty. Although no known research has yet examined this connection, it is likely that internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes may moderate (i.e., weaken) the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and internalized standards of beauty, thereby contributing to less body surveillance.</p>
<p>Moreover, research has suggested that African American women with less affirming racial identities tend to be less attuned to their emotional states and possess greater alexithymic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684312474799">Dinsmore &amp; Mallinckrodt, 1996</xref>). Alexithymia is conceptually similar to interoceptive awareness in that both emphasize lack of attunement with one’s emotional states. Alexithymia, which means “no words for mood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0361684312474799">Sifneos, 1973</xref>), is a pattern of cognitive and affective difficulty with identifying and describing emotions, with distinguishing between emotional and bodily sensations, and with engaging in introspective thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0361684312474799">Taylor, Bagby, &amp; Parker, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684312474799">Dinsmore and Mallinckrodt (1996)</xref> suggested that alexithymia may develop among oppressed groups who seek acceptance from majority culture, and these symptoms may be an adaptive response whereby such individuals protect themselves from prolonged emotional distress by disengaging emotionally. If African American women with less affirming racial identities possess less awareness of their emotional and cognitive states, then it is likely that the converse may be true. Thus, we expect that African American women with more affirming racial identities may possess more awareness of their emotional and bodily states.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0361684312474799">
<title>Present Study and Proposed Model</title>
<p>Our research seeks to develop and test a theoretical model of African American women’s experiences with disordered eating (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0361684312474799">Figure 1</xref>). Specifically, we hypothesize that internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes will weaken the positive relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and an internalized thin ideal (Path C), which would then correlate with decreased body surveillance (Path E). In addition, we expect that an internalized thin ideal will mediate the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and body surveillance (Path A–E), between sexually objectifying experiences and body shame (Path A–F), and between sexually objectifying experiences and appearance anxiety (Path A–G). Moreover, we expect that body surveillance will mediate the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and body shame (Path B–I), between sexually objectifying experiences and appearance anxiety (Path B–K), and between sexually objectifying experiences and interoceptive awareness (Path B–L). In turn, we predict that an internalized thin ideal (Path H), body shame (Path N), appearance anxiety (Path O), and interoceptive awareness (Path P) will predict disordered eating. Based upon prior research, we expect that body shame will predict appearance anxiety (Path J; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684312474799">Tiggemann &amp; Williams, 2012</xref>) and interoceptive awareness (Path M; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684312474799">Kozee &amp; Tylka, 2006</xref>). Finally, we also hypothesize that higher levels of internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes will be associated with greater interoceptive awareness (Path D). A moderated measured variable path analysis (MMVPA) will be conducted to test the research hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684312474799">Preacher, Rucker, &amp; Hayes, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 278 African American undergraduate women participated in our study, with a mean age of 20.53 (<italic>SD = </italic>5.37, range = 18–60). About 45% (<italic>n</italic> = 126) were first year students; 26% (71), sophomores; 21% (59), juniors; and about 8% (22), seniors. About 82% (228) were Christian; 10% (27), spiritual but not religious; 7, agnostic; 4, atheist; 4, Muslim; 1, Jewish; and 3% (7) did not respond. Most participants identified as straight/heterosexual (94%; 261); others claimed a sexual minority status (6, lesbian; 7, bisexual; 1, pan/omnisexual; and 3, did not answer). In terms of relationship status, approximately 95% (264) were single, 11 were married/partnered, and two did not respond. Participants also differed according to their family’s annual income: 16 made less than $10k; 26, between $10k and $20k; 36, between $20k and $30k; 38, between $30k and $40k; 69, between $40k and $60k; 38, between $60k and $80k; 31, between $80k and $100k; and 22, over $100k. To calculate participants’ body mass index (BMI) and control for this potential confounding variable, BMI was calculated as (weight in pounds/height in inches)<sup>2</sup> × 703. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0361684312474799">Centers for Disease Control’s (2011)</xref> weight categories, approximately 5% (14) of the respondents were underweight (BMI of less than 18.5); 54% (14), normal (BMI: 18.50–24.99); 25% (69), overweight (BMI: 25–29.99); and 17% (46), obese (BMI ≥30).</p>

<sec id="section7-0361684312474799">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Eligibility criteria for participation required that participants (a) be 18 years or older, (b) be enrolled in an undergraduate course(s) at a large Southeastern U.S. University, and (c) identify as an African American/Black woman. Participants were recruited through their introduction to psychology courses and received course credit for their participation. Prior to participation, participants were informed that the purpose of the study was to further understand African American women’s social experiences, body image, and eating patterns. Interested participants were directed to an online survey that presented the study’s materials in the following order.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section9-0361684312474799">
<title>Appearance Anxiety</title>
<p>The Appearance Anxiety Questionnaire (AAQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684312474799">Dion, Dion, &amp; Keelan, 1990</xref>) was used as a measure of appearance-related anxiety. The AAQ consists of 30 items that are rated on a 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>almost always</italic>) scale, whereby higher scores represent greater appearance anxiety. An example of the scale items is “I am self-conscious about the way I look.” Originally normed on predominantly White samples, the 30-item measure has demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .89) and test–retest reliabilities (<italic>r </italic>= .89) over a 2-week period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684312474799">Dion et al., 1990</xref>). Convergent validity was also assessed, finding that the measure negatively correlated with self-esteem and positively correlated with shyness, social avoidance, distress, and public self-consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684312474799">Dion et al., 1990</xref>). To our knowledge, ours is the first study to utilize the AAQ with a sample of African American women, yielding a Cronbach’s α of .91.</p>

<p>Multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes were assessed utilizing the Internalization Multicultural Inclusive (IMCI) subscale of the Cross Racial Identity Scale (CRIS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0361684312474799">Vandiver, Cross, Worrell, &amp; Fhagen-Smith, 2002</xref>). The overall CRIS was normed on undergraduate African Americans. Individuals with high scores on the IMCI are characterized as having an affirmative attitude toward their own racial group, as well as understanding the linkages among different forms of oppression and valuing an inclusive society. An example item is “I believe it is important to have both a Black identity and a multicultural perspective, which is inclusive of everyone (e.g., Asians, Latinos, gays, lesbians, Jews, Whites, etc.).” The subscale consists of 5 items, and participants are asked to rate themselves on a 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (s<italic>trongly agree</italic>) Likert-type scale, whereby higher scores reflect stronger endorsements of a multicultural identity. Reliability coefficients for this subscale have demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .82). Within our study, α for this subscale was adequate (α = .79). Convergent validity tests reveal that the IMCI subscale was correlated with the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity’s Humanist and Oppressed Minority Scales, suggesting that this subscale measures an acceptance of one’s own cultural group as well as others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0361684312474799">Worrell, Vandiver, &amp; Cross, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Body Surveillance</title>
<p>The Body Surveillance subscale of the Objectified Body Consciousness Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684312474799">McKinley &amp; Hyde, 1996</xref>) is typically used to measure self-objectification. Body surveillance may be defined by the extent to which women monitor their body and think about their body in terms of it looks as opposed to how it feels. The Body Surveillance subscale consists of 8 items that are rated on a 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) scale, along with a “not applicable” option. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684312474799">McKinley and Hyde (1996)</xref> recommend averaging the number of applicable items to achieve an overall score. Higher scores on the measure indicate higher levels of body surveillance. An example item includes “I think more about how my body feels than how my body looks” (reverse scored). Normed predominantly on White undergraduate women, the Body Surveillance subscale has demonstrated strong internal consistency (α = .89), test–retest reliability over a 2-week period (<italic>r </italic>= .79), and convergent validity (<italic>r </italic>= .73) with the Public and Private Self-Consciousness Scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684312474799">McKinley &amp; Hyde, 1996</xref>). The reliability coefficient within our study was good (α = .82). The Body Surveillance subscale was previously utilized within a study assessing body image dissatisfaction among African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684312474799">Buchanan, Fischer, Tokar, &amp; Yoder, 2008</xref>), and results revealed that body surveillance was associated with more body shame among African American women.</p>

<title>Body Shame</title>
<p>The Body Shame subscale of the Objectified Body Consciousness Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684312474799">McKinley &amp; Hyde, 1996</xref>) is an 8-item measure designed to measure the extent to which a woman feels inadequate if she does not conform to societal expectations of her body. An example item is “I feel ashamed of myself when I haven’t made the effort to look my best.” Items on the Body Shame subscale are rated on a 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 <italic>(strongly agree</italic>) scale, along with a “not applicable” option. Applicable items are averaged, and higher scores suggest greater body shame. This subscale was also normed on primarily White undergraduate women. Within White samples, the subscale has demonstrated adequate internal consistency (α = .75), test–retest reliability over a 2-week period (<italic>r </italic>= .79), and divergent validity (<italic>r </italic>= –.51) from the Body Esteem Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684312474799">McKinley &amp; Hyde, 1996</xref>).

<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>Prior to testing our model, the data were screened for a number of potential problems, including univariate and multivariate outliers, nonlinearity, nonnormal distributions, missing data, and multicollinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684312474799">Kline, 2005</xref>). Utilizing Weston and Gore’s (2006) criteria for determining nonnormal distributions (skewedness greater than the absolute value of 3 and kurtosis scores greater than the absolute value of 10), no measures demonstrated violations of normality. With regard to multivariate normality, Cook’s Distance criterion (<italic>Cook’s D</italic> &gt; 4/278 = .014) revealed one problematic case, which was removed from the data set. Cases with minimal missing data (&lt;20%) were maintained. To assess the nature of the missing data, data were screened utilizing Little’s missing completely at random (MCAR) test, and results suggested that the missing items were, in fact, missing at random, χ<sup>2</sup>(2,476) = 2,544.81, <italic>p </italic>= .16. In order to correct for remaining missing data points across participants, multiple imputations were applied to the data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684312474799">Kline, 2005</xref>). Multiple imputations predict missing values based upon existing values from other variables. The predictions for missing values across all participants were made 5 times (five imputations), and we used the fifth imputed data set for our analysis.</p>
<p>In addition, correlations with continuous demographic variables (age, BMI) were performed with the variables under investigation in order to detect potential confounding variables. For the preliminary analyses, α was adjusted (.05/7 = .007) in order to control for Type I error. Age was found to have a significant effect on the variables under investigation. Specifically, age had a significant inverse relationship with body surveillance (<italic>r </italic>= –.19, <italic>p </italic>= .002) and sexually objectifying experiences (<italic>r</italic> = –.22, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001). In addition, BMI was significantly correlated with eating disordered behavior (<italic>r </italic>= .20, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001), body shame, (<italic>r </italic>= .31, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001), and appearance anxiety (<italic>r </italic>= .29, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001). Next, partial correlations (controlling for age and BMI) were run in order to assess relationships among the variables under investigation. All relationships were in the expected direction (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0361684312474799">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Moderated Measured Variable Path Analysis</title>
<p>In terms of sample size for path analyses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684312474799">Kline (2005)</xref> suggested that, at minimum, 10 participants are needed for the number of freed parameters; however, 200 or more participants are ideal. Thus, our sample of 279 participants appears adequate to reach statistical significance. After the data were screened, an MMVPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684312474799">Preacher et al., 2007</xref>), controlling for age and BMI, was conducted in order to test the moderating role of racial identity in the relationships among sexually objectifying experiences, internalized standards of beauty, and body surveillance. Moderated mediation procedures estimate conditional indirect effects of an independent variable on an outcome variable through a mediating variable, which is conditional as a moderating variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684312474799">Preacher et al., 2007</xref>). We assessed a model akin to Model 2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684312474799">Preacher, Rucker, and Hayes (2007)</xref>. In the case of our model, the causal independent variable is sexually objectifying experiences, the mediator is internalized sociocultural standards of beauty, and the dependent variable is body surveillance. The moderator variable is internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes, which we predict will moderate the indirect relation from sexually objectifying experiences to body surveillance via the mediating role of internalization of sociocultural standards of beauty.</p>
<p>In conducting the MMVPA, first we examined the mediating role internalized sociocultural standards of beauty in the link between sexually objectifying experiences and body surveillance; next we examined these relationships while looking at the way in which racial identity may moderate the aforementioned relationships; and then we added the moderator to the full path analysis of the predicted model; our results are presented accordingly. Without the moderator in the model, bootstrapping procedures, taking 5,000 bootstrap samples from the original data in order to compute a 95% bias-corrected confidence interval, were utilized to test the indirect effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684312474799">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>). If the 95% CI includes zero, then the indirect effect is nonsignificant. Data revealed that the internalization of sociocultural standards of beauty mediated the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and body surveillance: 95% CI [.02, .22].</p>
<p>Next, Preacher et al.’s (2007) computer macro was utilized to conduct the moderated mediation analysis. This macro provides the results of the conditional indirect effect at one standard deviation above and below the mean of the moderator. Results revealed that internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes moderated the mediating role of internalized sociocultural standards of beauty in the link between sexually objectifying experiences and body surveillance. Specifically, the indirect relation between sexual objectification experiences and body surveillance was significant and positive when multicultural inclusive attitudes were at the sample mean (<italic>M </italic>= 28.87, <italic>z </italic>= 2.35, <italic>p </italic>= .02, indirect effect = .11, <italic>SE</italic> = .05) or one standard deviation below the mean (<italic>M </italic>= 23.43, <italic>z </italic>= 2.74, <italic>p </italic>= .006, indirect effect = .17, <italic>SE</italic> = .06); but this indirect relation was nonsignificant when multicultural inclusive attitudes were one standard deviation above the mean (<italic>M </italic>= 34.39, <italic>z </italic>= .81, <italic>p </italic>= .42, indirect effect = 05, <italic>SE</italic> = .06). These findings reveal that higher multicultural inclusive attitudes (i.e., one standard deviation above the sample mean) buffered (i.e., made nonsignificant) the positive link between sexually objectifying experiences and body surveillance (Path A–E).</p>
<p>Next, we examined the conditional interaction effect within the broader path analysis testing the remaining hypotheses. In order to include the moderated mediation in the model, an interaction term (sexual objectification × internalized multicultural inclusive identity) was created using centered ISOS and internalized multicultural inclusive subscale scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684312474799">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>), and this interaction term was included in the broader model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0361684312474799">Figure 2</xref>). Version 8.80 of Lisrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312474799">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 2006</xref>) was utilized to conduct the path analyses. Syntax coding was input into to Lisrel 8.80 prior to conducting the analyses. With samples less than 500, comparative fit index (CFI) values greater than .90, and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) scores below .10 suggest acceptable data-to-model fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0361684312474799">Weston &amp; Gore, 2006</xref>).

</fig>
<p>Lagrange multipliers, provided by Lisrel 8.80 (Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 2006), were then consulted in order to determine if the addition of certain paths improved the data-to-model fit. Given that adding paths takes the analysis into an exploratory mode, only theoretically defensible paths were added. A direct path from sexually objectifying experiences to interoceptive awareness, RMSEA = .08; 90% CI [.05, .10]; CFI = .97; SRMR = .05, was added based on the idea that sexually objectifying experiences may make women more aware that they are being evaluated based upon their appearance, perhaps becoming more self-conscious and less aware of internal states. Results demonstrated that adding this path (Path Q) resulted in a significant improvement in data-to-model fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 11.54, <italic>p </italic>= .0007.</p>
<p>Following the analysis of data-to-model fit, <italic>t</italic> values were examined in order to see which paths were statistically significant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0361684312474799">Figure 2</xref>). The paths from sexually objectifying experiences to body surveillance, and from appearance anxiety to disordered eating, were nonsignificant. Thus, we dropped these paths and reran the trimmed model, RMSEA = .07; 90% CI [.05, .10]; CFI = .97; SRMR = .05. Results demonstrated that the trimmed model was not significantly different from the original model, χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 1.93, <italic>p</italic> = .38, and therefore we retained the original predicted model. Body shame, appearance anxiety, interoceptive awareness, and internalized sociocultural standards of beauty accounted for 53% of the variance in disordered eating. Internalized sociocultural standards of beauty and sexually objectifying experiences accounted for 21% of the variance in body surveillance. Body surveillance and internalized sociocultural standards of beauty accounted for 19% of the variance in body shame. Body surveillance, body shame, and internalized sociocultural standards of beauty accounted for 56% of the variance in appearance anxiety. Body surveillance, body shame, sexually objectifying experiences, and internalized multicultural inclusive identity accounted for 30% of the variance in interoceptive awareness. Sexually objectifying experiences, internalized multicultural inclusive identity, and the interaction between sexually objectifying experiences and internalized multicultural inclusive identity accounted for 4% of the variance in internalized sociocultural standards of beauty.</p>
<p>Essentially, our results demonstrated that internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes moderated the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and internalized sociocultural standards of beauty. That is, when rates of sexual objectification were high and multicultural inclusive racial identity attitudes were average or low, participants were more likely to internalize sociocultural standards of beauty; however, this relationship was no longer significant when levels of internalized multicultural racial identity attitudes were higher. Internalized sociocultural standards of beauty was then related to increased body surveillance, body shame, appearance anxiety, and disordered eating. In addition, body surveillance was related to increased body shame, appearance anxiety, and poorer interoceptive awareness. Consistent with our hypotheses, both body shame and interoceptive awareness predicted eating disordered behaviors; however, appearance anxiety did not. Also consistent with our hypothesis, greater degrees of internalized multicultural inclusive racial attitudes were directly related to better interoceptive awareness. Contrary to our hypothesis, sexually objectifying experiences were not directly related to body surveillance.</p>
<p>Next, indirect effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684312474799">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>) were assessed. Several of the indirect relationships have been supported by prior research; these include (a) the mediating role of an internalized thin ideal in the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and disordered eating, sexual objectification, and body surveillance, as well as between sexual objectification and body shame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0361684312474799">Moradi, Dirks, &amp; Matteson, 2005</xref>); (b) the partial mediating role of body surveillance in the relationship between an internalized thin ideal and body shame, and in the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and body shame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0361684312474799">Wiseman &amp; Moradi, 2010</xref>); and (c) the mediating role of body shame in the relationship between an internalized thin ideal and disordered eating, and the partially mediating role between body surveillance and disordered eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0361684312474799">Wiseman &amp; Moradi, 2010</xref>). All other proposed indirect effects were exploratory in nature.</p>
<p>Bootstrap procedures taking 5,000 bootstrap samples from the original data in order to compute a 95% bias-corrected confidence interval were utilized to assess indirect effects (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0361684312474799">Table 2</xref>). Again, if the 95% CI includes 0, then the indirect effect is nonsignificant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684312474799">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>). Given that multiple indirect effects were assessed, other contributing variables (including age, BMI, and other predictor variables) to the criterion variable were controlled in order to determine true indirect effects. As previously noted, findings revealed that internalized sociocultural standards of beauty fully mediated the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and body surveillance. Body surveillance partially mediated the relationship between internalized sociocultural standards of beauty and body shame, as well as between internalized sociocultural standards of beauty and appearance anxiety. Body shame partially mediated the relationship between internalized sociocultural standards of beauty and disordered eating, while fully mediating the relationship between body surveillance and disordered eating. In addition, body shame partially mediated the relationship between internalized sociocultural standards of beauty and appearance anxiety, as well as in the relationship between body surveillance and appearance anxiety. Interoceptive awareness fully mediated the relationships between body surveillance and disordered eating, between multicultural inclusive racial identity and disordered eating, between sexually objectifying experiences and disordered eating, and between body shame and disordered eating.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results from our study revealed the importance of integrating racial identity when exploring objectification theory among African American women. Specifically, data demonstrated the importance of multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes. When sexually objectifying experiences were high and multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes were average or low, participants were more likely to internalize sociocultural standards of beauty, and internalized sociocultural standards of beauty were then associated with increased body surveillance. In contrast, the conditional indirect effects were no longer statistically significant when internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes were high, suggesting that multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes buffer the link between sexually objectifying experience and an internalized thin ideal.</p>
<p>Our findings also reveal the deleterious effects when African American women internalize a thin ideal. Internalized sociocultural standards of beauty fully mediated the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and body surveillance. Internalization of dominant Euro-American standards was related not only to body surveillance but also to body shame, appearance anxiety, and eating disordered behaviors. Although African American women have been perceived as protected against eating disturbances due to cultural standards of beauty that tend to emphasize curves and shapeliness over the thin ideal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684312474799">Gordon et al., 2010</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0361684312474799">Poran (2002)</xref> revealed that, in fact, many African American women have equated physical beauty with White standards of beauty (i.e., thin, long blonde hair, straight nose, White skin, blue eyes). Indeed, our findings suggest that identification with European American standards of beauty appears to negatively affect African American women’s relationships with and evaluation of their bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684312474799">Rogers Wood &amp; Petrie, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings from our study also revealed the importance of interoceptive awareness in African American women’s experiences with sexual objectification and disordered eating. With the addition of the direct path from sexually objectifying experiences to the interoceptive awareness variable, data demonstrated that interoceptive awareness fully mediated the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and disordered eating. In addition, interoceptive awareness fully mediated the relationship between body surveillance and disordered eating. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0361684312474799">Myers and Crowther (2008)</xref> found that interoceptive awareness partially mediated the relationship between self-objectification (measured by the SOQ) and disordered eating, our results suggest that, for African American women, this variable may be an integral part of their experience with disordered eating. Further, interoceptive awareness partially mediated the relationship between body shame and disordered eating. Essentially, these findings suggest that, for African American women, sexually objectifying experiences, body shame, and body surveillance are linked with lower abilities to identify and communicate one’s emotional and physical sensations, which are then related to disordered eating.</p>
<p>Consistent with prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684312474799">Dinsmore &amp; Mallinckrodt, 1996</xref>), multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes were related to increased interoceptive awareness. Our findings also suggested that interoceptive awareness fully mediates the relationship between multicultural racial identity attitudes and disordered eating. This finding suggests that affirmation of one’s race and other cultural groups is linked with better recognition and communication of one’s emotional and physiological states, and in turn, the abilities to recognize and express these states are related to diminished levels of disordered eating. Again, this finding suggests that a multiculturally inclusive racial identity is a protective factor in the lives of African American women, especially when it comes to body image and eating-related concerns.</p>
<p>Our findings point to the importance of developing and facilitating more multiculturally inclusive attitudes in the lives of African American women. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684312474799">Cross and Vandiver (2001)</xref>, individuals with multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes tend to be more affirming of their own race and of others, more aware of the linkages among various types of oppression, and more committed to social change. Thus, African American women with multicultural racial identities may be more aware of and attuned to the ways that sexist and racist systems of oppression interact to influence and limit identity construction. As a result of such awareness, African American women with multicultural racial identities may be more likely to challenge, question, and resist racially and sexually objectifying messages and images; may be less likely to internalize European American standards of beauty; and may be more aware of their emotional and physiological states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312474799">Bradford &amp; Petrie, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Contrary to Fredrickson and Roberts’ (1997) assertions, appearance anxiety did not predict disordered eating in our model; however, there was a statistically significant correlation between these two variables. This perplexing finding may be because appearance anxiety, as it was measured, does not tap into a unique construct. The high correlation between body shame and appearance anxiety (<italic>r </italic>= .61) suggests potential collinearity between these two variables, and therefore may have resulted in a nonsignificant relationship in the path model. Research investigating appearance anxiety as a mediator in relation to disordered eating has been mixed. Whereas some studies have suggested that appearance anxiety is a predictor of disordered eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684312474799">Koskina, Van den Eynde, Meisel, Campbell, &amp; Schmidt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684312474799">Slater &amp; Tiggemann, 2010</xref>), other studies have suggested that it is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0361684312474799">Slater &amp; Tiggemann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0361684312474799">Tiggemann &amp; Slater, 2001</xref>). Given these equivocal findings, more research and exploration is needed to understand the relationship between appearance anxiety and eating disordered behaviors for African American women.</p>

<title>Practice Implications</title>
<p>The moderating effect of a multicultural racial identity on internalized standards of beauty and the significant direct relationship between multicultural racial identity and interoceptive awareness suggest the importance of African American women developing an African consciousness and positive race salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0361684312474799">Worrell, Vandiver, Schaefer, Cross, &amp; Fhagen-Smith, 2006</xref>). Clinicians may collaboratively discuss the role of racial identity in the lives of their clients, while discussing the benefits of acceptance and positive identification with one’s cultural group(s). In doing so, clinicians may also discuss the role of internalized racism with their clients, challenging their clients to consider how they may have internalized values and beauty standards associated with the dominant culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0361684312474799">Szymanski, Carr, &amp; Moffitt, 2011</xref>). In doing so, mental health professionals may challenge their clients to critically examine the role of beauty standards in their life, while discussing the deleterious impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0361684312474799">Phelps, Sapia, Nathanson, &amp; Nelson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Clinicians and counselors may also discuss the role of positive race salience as it relates to interoceptive awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684312474799">Dinsmore &amp; Mallinckrodt, 1996</xref>). Increased interoceptive awareness may also be facilitated through activities (such as yoga, meditation, or dance) that serve to increase awareness of mind–body connections and emotional states. In fact, preliminary research suggests a relationship between meditation and higher interoceptive awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0361684312474799">Woolley, 2010</xref>), as well as a negative relationship between intuitive eating and interoceptive awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0361684312474799">Tylka, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and disordered eating for African American women highlights the deleterious impact of sexism and racism on African American women’s mental and physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684312474799">Kessler, Mickelson, &amp; Willams, 1999</xref>). An understanding of the manifestations of sexism, the representation of African American women throughout history and in the media, and strategies to confront (when appropriate and safe) and/or ignore (when necessary) could potentially minimize the connection between sexually objectifying experiences and disordered eating (Watson, Robinson et al., 2012). Specifically, mental health professionals may educate their clients that these standards are rooted in racist and sexist imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684312474799">Rubin, Nemeroff, &amp; Russo, 2004</xref>) and that the internalization of these standards may negatively alter women’s relationships with their bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0361684312474799">Szymanski et al., 2011</xref>). Coping methods and interventions which serve to empower African American women in the face of objectifying experiences seem warranted. These include developing the ability to discern sexist events for what they are without internalizing these experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0361684312474799">Szymanski et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section22-0361684312474799">
<title>Strengths, Limitations, and Future Research</title>
<p>There are a number of strengths to our study. Ours is one of a few studies to extend objectification theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0361684312474799">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>) to a surveyed sample of African American women. However, our sample was limited to undergraduate women, and therefore our findings cannot be generalized beyond the undergraduate sample. Moreover, our study considered the ways that racial identity may contribute to psychological sequelae associated with sexual objectification and may buffer against body symptoms and distress. The variables under investigation explained a large amount of the variance in eating disordered behaviors (59%), interoceptive awareness (30%), and appearance anxiety (56%), providing a great deal of insight into the factors that contribute to body image concerns and disordered eating among African American women.</p>
<p>There are also several limitations and areas for future research. Our study did not differentiate between different types of eating disordered behaviors (e.g., bulimia, anorexia, and binge eating disorder). The EAT-26 only assesses for symptoms of anorexia and bulimia. Research suggests that African American women may have higher rates of binge eating disorders than other cultural groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684312474799">Henrickson et al., 2010</xref>). Future research may include measures of binge eating in order to more thoroughly understand African American women’s experiences with disordered eating behaviors. In addition, our study assessed the extent to which sociocultural standards of beauty (i.e., White/majority culture’s standards of beauty, thin ideal) are internalized among African American women. Future research may assess identification with more culturally congruent standards of beauty and explore how these standards of beauty affect African American women’s body image and eating behaviors.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned limitations of measures, the survey instruments were presented in a fixed order, and therefore order effects may be present. Validity questions (e.g., to make sure you are paying attention, please mark 3 for this answer) were not included, and therefore we were unable to detect and remove participants who were responding in a random manner. Although many of the utilized measures appeared reliable within our sample, most of these have not been normed on samples restricted to African American women. Thus, there is a need to develop measures that are applicable to and normed on Women of Color in order to advance research on objectification theory.</p>
<p>Path analyses rely upon correlational data, and therefore causality may not be inferred; thus, experimental and longitudinal studies are especially warranted to further understand the impact of sexual objectification on women’s lived experiences. In addition, modification indices suggested that we alter our model in order to improve data-to-model fit. The addition of a pathway from sexually objectifying experiences to interoceptive awareness resulted in a significant improvement in the model, although the initial proposed model was also acceptable. This finding underscores the importance of considering alternative models that may explain African American women’s experiences with sexual objectification and eating disordered behaviors.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of our study was to examine objectification theory and disordered eating among African American women, while also exploring the role that racial identity may play. Findings revealed that internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes moderated the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and internalized sociocultural standards, which was then related to body surveillance. That is, when sexually objectifying experiences were high and racial identity attitudes were average or low, participants were more likely to internalize a thin ideal, which was linked with increased body surveillance, body shame, appearance anxiety, disordered eating, and poorer interoceptive awareness. In contrast, internalized multiculturally inclusive racial attitudes served to buffer against these negative effects, underscoring the importance of developing positive racial identity attitudes. Overall, our study elucidates the importance of considering the broad range and intersections of women’s diversity within objectification theory.</p>
