<p>A new book by Matthew Carr is always an exciting prospect, like setting off on a long train journey full of enthusiasm for what you will see and who you will meet along the way. And <italic>Fortress Europe</italic>, as with his two most recent books on the history of terrorism and the purge of Muslim Spain, does not disappoint.</p>
<p>This book – the result of two and a half years’ travel and investigation – is divided into two sections: Hard Borders which focuses on the militarised borders of Europe and Border Crossings which examines the risks and consequences for those compelled to breach them. The bulk of the book concerns itself with the ‘hard borders’ that have developed, post-Maastricht and Schengen, to protect the borderless zone of Europe’s enlarged inner core from ‘unwanted intruders’. Such ‘compensatory’ or ‘reinforced’ controls, Carr explains, have led to the rapid transformation of national borders from territorial dividing lines to militarised zones replete with saturation satellite surveillance and an archipelago of detention centres. Carr’s analysis of the route to militarised borders is not new. The European Council on Refugees and Exiles, Pro Asyl, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Institute of Race Relations have all published reports on the human rights abuses that occur at Europe’s militarised borders. But his take differs, not just in its journalistic style, but in its panoramic perspective. In this respect, it should be read alongside Migreurop’s equally comprehensive but visual <italic>Atlas des migrants en Europe</italic>.</p>
<p>Carr takes us across the continent, to the eastern borderlands surrounding the Ukraine, Europe’s southern maritime borders, Greek islands, the Ionian coast and the Evros Prefecture, and back to Calais and Dover. (He also travelled to Morocco and Turkey.) His is not only a complete geographical account, but one which foregrounds a variety of voices (migrants, refugees, politicians, human rights campaigners, servants, police and border guards). But, as Carr readily acknowledges, central to his dispatches were the guides, opening up pathways for him into regions that in some respects resemble war zones. And those who knew the paths best came not from the larger NGOs but from small local initiatives, with few funds but dedication to the task of making the lives of migrants and refugees bearable (and sometimes keeping them alive). In Morocco, there is the Association Beni Znassen for Culture, Development and Solidarity (ABCDS) which provides humanitarian relief to the sub-Saharan Africans and others who subsist in the <italic>tranquilo</italic> migrant forest camps that surround the city of Oudja. At Lampedusa, the members of the <italic>Associazione Askavusa</italic> (Barefoot Association) find the funds to cook one hundred meals a day for the boat people who, in 2011, were arriving sick, frozen and penniless from Tunisia. Likewise, in the Ionian coastal port town of Igoumenitsa, the Migrant Solidarity Network delivers food, clothes and blankets to the ‘illegal travellers’ subsisting in the hills that surround the port facility, hoping to smuggle themselves onto a ferry for Italy. And in France, the UK, Spain and Italy there are the militant activists of the No Border movement, who one day mingle with dispossessed travellers in the squats, abandoned factories and railway wagons of Calais, and the next day rally to the defence of hunger strikers in Harmondsworth detention centre. (In a chapter fittingly entitled ‘Hands across the border’, Carr describes various forms of social activism, motivated by political, secular and religious traditions but always starting from a humanitarian impulse.)</p>
<p>In the Hard Borders section the focus is often on the countries bordering the Ukraine, which, since signing up to the EU Neighbourhood Policy, have done the dirty work of managing refugee and migratory movements for the benefit of the EU. It actually took Carr, travelling by car, four and a half hours to get from the Ukrainian crossing point to the Slovak side of the border, a distance of approximately 500 metres. Carr visited the remote Polish border town of Terespol (where fifty to seventy asylum seekers arrive each week), the Slovakian border town of Sobrance (where even if, by some miracle, ‘illegal travellers’ manage to scale the 300 metre two-tiered fence under permanent camera surveillance they would immediately be returned to Ukraine) and, in Ukraine itself, the city of Uzhgorod, the administrative capital of Ukrainian Transcarpathia.</p>
<p>‘Europe begins in Africa’, Carr reminds us, with reference to the Spanish North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. He is particularly strong on the Spanish–Moroccan relationship (Morocco like the Ukraine is part of the EU Neighbourhood Policy), and his rendering of the history of Melilla, which has continued in its tradition as ‘garrison-fortress’ (it was conquered by the Spanish in 1497 and was for a long period used as a penal colony for Spanish convicts), is fascinating. Indeed, Melilla is now the ‘most formidable and physically imposing of all the Schengen borders’, with its watchtowers, series of outer and inner fences and even a ‘tri-dimensional fence’ of interlocking cables, which ensnare the legs of intruders, providing the signal to trigger a pipe running at eye level along the length of the fence to spray pepper-infused water into the gap. The Melilla Civil Guard refer it as the ‘non-aggressive fence’.</p>
<p>The second thing that distinguishes <italic>Fortress Europe</italic> from other works on the subject is its depth. And because this book takes ‘the long view’ on Europe’s borders, it speaks directly to the concerns of human rights campaigners searching for an effective strategy to end daily brutalities and gross injustices. European refugee and migrant rights movements tend to two positions. On the one hand, there are the pragmatic NGOs, providing legal advice, lobbying the EU and the border authorities for fairer policies, sometimes even working inside detention centres with government approval. Then, there is the ‘no one is illegal’ movement, with its direct social activism, mistrust of all things governmental, anger at global injustice combined with a utopian vision of a world without borders. Carr offers us a way of combining conflicting positions on reform or abolition of immigration controls, by inviting readers to focus on what is realisable, in that it is already real.</p>
<p>Journalist by profession, Carr is a historian at heart. Throughout the book, he reminds us that Europe is a product of immigration and emigration, including forced emigration for economic reasons and political persecution. But the continent has also always been ‘multicultural’, characterised by shifting national jurisdictions and borderlands. Back in the sixteenth century, Calais was part of Britain, with its own representatives in Parliament. Uzhgorod has changed nationality various times (it was once the capital of Hungarian Ruthernan Carpenthia) and was a multiethnic city (of Hungarians, Russians, Romanians, Roma), long before the arrival of its new populations of Pakistanis, Palestinians, Sri Lankans, Somalis, Iraqis and Afghans. (Indeed, it was this extraordinary cultural and ethnic diversity of central and eastern Europe that the Nazis sought to eradicate in a cataclysmic ‘firestorm of violence’.)</p>
<p>The Mediterranean, now one of the world’s most militarised oceans, is the cradle of a unique civilisation embracing many influences – Christian, Islamic, European, Arab and African. While Lampedusa is often depicted by the far Right as a beleaguered outpost of Europe, it has ancient ties with North African cites such as Tripoli, Tunis and Benghazi, ensuring that the Tunisians who escaped turmoil at home in 2011 were not perceived by the islanders as ‘alien invaders’. Taking the long view of borders enables us to see what is ephemeral and what endures. Passports, for example, are a relatively recent phenomenon. Thus the book builds to its beautifully crafted finale in which Carr shows how borders are also bridges, because it is there that ‘linguistic, religious and ethnic categories merge’. In these ‘strikingly heterogeneous’ and ‘impure’ borderlands, borders have never been respected by their people, who share vineyards, vocabularies and intermingle in marriage and in death. It is in the borderlands, and not the borders, that our future lies.</p>
