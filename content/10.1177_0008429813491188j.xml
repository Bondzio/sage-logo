<p>Fifty years ago Kabbalah scholars were few. However, interest grew following the groundbreaking work of Gershom Scholem and today it is a popular area of study. The essays in <italic>Kabbalah and Modernity</italic> all manage to demonstrate this increasing attraction to Kabbalah, and the diversity of the field. Various topics such as the reappraisal of Kabbalah scholarship, the relation between Kabbalah and esotericism, Kabbalah in past and contemporary times, and the interaction between Kabbalah and politics, attest to the vitality and diversity of Kabbalah studies.</p>
<p>In Part I, Andreas B. Kilcher provides an analysis of the philology of Kabbalah turned into philology <italic>as</italic> Kabbalah in the works of three authors: Knorr von Rosenroth, J. G. Hamann and Gershom Scholem. Giulio Busi shows the importance of drawings in Kabbalah, despite their minimalization by first-rank scholars like Gershom Scholem or Moshe Idel. Eric Jacobson’s research is focused on the problem of evil and the future of Kabbalah.</p>
<p>Parts II and III contain essays that are informative and pleasurable to read: Kocku von Stuckrad’s captivating journey through the history of <italic>shekhinah</italic>, ending in a subtle analysis of Madonna’s works and behavior, stands out in this regard.</p>
<p>Many ideas founded in the book deserve attention and beg future debate, namely Marco Pasi’s wondering if a “post-Christian” tag may be more appropriate than the term “Western,” Wouter J. Hanegraaff’s analysis of G. Sholem’s creative misinterpretations of Kabbalah, Sara Møldrup Thejl’s argument that the interpretation of the controversial Danish writer Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff is Kabbalistic regardless of how revolutionary it is, and Jonatan Meir’s conclusion that the conventional image of Kabbalah needs corrections. Jean-Pierre Brach’s study criticizes Paul Vulliaud’s “traditionalism” as represented by R. Guénon, J. Evola and F. Schuon.</p>
<p>Several of these essays will interest not only Jewish studies scholars, but other specialists as well. Konstantin Burmistrov’s voyage through the history of Russian occultism of the eighteenth to twentieth centuries would be of interest to historians, Steven M. Wasserstrom’s exposé examining several novels and the non-fictional works of Ernst Jünger – one of the most appreciated and contested writers of the twentieth century – will be of interest to many literary critics, Shaul Magid’s profound analysis of philosophical pragmatism, represented by William James, and the “Jewish Renewals” in America, especially the work of Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi that explores “metaphysical pluralism” (381), may interest many philosophers. In Part IV, negative aspects are also studied, such as Gideon Aran’s timely treatment of suicide terrorism.</p>
<p>The book focuses more on the “complex dynamics” (9) between Kabbalah and modernity, as the title reveals, and is less about texts. Therefore the lack of a chapter interpreting expressly Kabbalah doctrines is understandable, but regrettable. Despite this minor shortcoming, this is an important volume for Kabbalah studies in particular, and religious studies in general. It has high standards of research and ample bibliographies, and unlocks the gate for a better understanding of Jewish religion and mysticism.</p>
