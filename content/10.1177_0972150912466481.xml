<p>Though organizational development (OD) has its roots planted in applied social and psychological sciences, it emerged as a field of practice and academic discipline in the 1980s and 1990s. With vague boundaries and a plethora of specialized approaches added to its features, OD is perhaps less understood or recognized in comparison to other subjects or streams. But two facts that cannot be denied are that OD is soundly based on an extensive body of research, theory and practice and that the OD approach is the flavour or hot topic of management consulting.</p>
<p>With new types of organizations, new ways of doing business and new economic sectors, changes are uncertain and rapid. Owing to this, organizations are going to encounter new challenges, new learning needs and new stresses. This has triggered the importance of OD, thereby refining or redefining the concept. This book presents a clear and elaborate picture of OD in its various forms.</p>
<p>The book <italic>Organization Development: Accelerating Learning and Transformation</italic> is organized in three parts. ‘OD Concepts, Issues, and Theoretical Foundations’ constitutes Part 1. Part 2 deals with ‘Cases and Learning Resources’ and Part 3 consists of ‘Interviews’ with OD leaders.</p>
<p>Part 1 presents concepts, issues and the theoretical base of OD. It enumerates OD’s journey from its inception to the current challenges it faces. This section covers a whole range of issues such as the stages of an OD process, person-based and role-based interventions, action research, survey feedback, power and politics and the eight myths that keep OD consultants from doing their best work. The beauty of this section is that it explains a wide array of OD interventions enriched with case examples. The crux of this section lies in understanding OD concepts, understanding the combined role of OD and human resources and the problems faced by global and Indian OD practitioners.</p>
<p>Nine learning resources and nine case studies on OD interventions constitute the second part of the book. Learning resources are application-based short essays and instruments that explain successful OD implementation. The inclusion of two instruments on organizational readiness for change and assessment of individual’s leadership style shows the importance of OD intervention. In addition to these, the nine case studies in this section enrich the pragmatism of the OD concept. The cases are based on both private and public sector organizations. Overall this section presents a holistic view of various OD intervention techniques.</p>
<p>The last part of the book deals with interviews conducted with five OD experts. The interviews provide insight into a wide gamut of OD issues from a practitioner’s lens. These eminent OD practitioners are from organizations such as IBM, L&amp;T, Aditya Birla group, etc. The interviews provide a thorough understanding of OD in terms of theory, interventions, issues, concepts, challenges and future directions.</p>
<p>The second edition has broadened the scope of OD with a wide gamut of issues pertaining to today’s organizations that work with different social architectures. The emergence of a more diverse workforce, rampant changes, new industrial nations, onslaught of new business domains and so on, have made this generation of organizations more volatile, thereby making their survival difficult. So, in order to cope with this cut-throat competition, there is an urgent burden on human resources and OD practitioners to manage and motivate the workforce in the right direction. This book thus acts as a yardstick for successful implementation of OD concepts in organizations. The clarity with which various concepts and issues are presented will definitely help academicians to develop new ideas in times to come.</p>
