<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article is to provide a summative report of the applications submitted for the Experience Documentation Opportunity (EDO), implemented by the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC). The EDO was a one-time, 6-month opportunity for health education specialists holding the entry-level certification (Certified Health Education Specialist or CHES) for 5 or more continuous years, with active status, to submit documentation to verify practice at the advanced level to become a Master Certified Health Education Specialist (MCHES), the new advanced certification. The EDO process was rigorous and effective in verifying a professional’s level of practice. A total of 862 applications were submitted to NCHEC; 819 were approved, 36 denied, and 7 withdrew. Frequency distributions indicate which advanced-level subcompetencies were used the most and least for applications. Results of the EDO process provide valuable information regarding characteristics of the first cohort of MCHES, as well as a direct assessment of advanced-level practice in the field of health education.</p>

<p>The purpose of this article is to provide a summative report of the applications submitted for the Experience Documentation Opportunity (EDO). The EDO was a one-time, 6-month opportunity for health education specialists holding the entry-level certification (Certified Health Education Specialist or CHES) for 5 or more years, with active status, to submit documentation to verify practice at the advanced level to become a Master Certified Health Education Specialist (MCHES), the new advanced certification. Before describing the EDO process and application characteristics, a brief history of how two levels of certification emerged in the field of health education is warranted.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839912455176">
<title>Background</title>
<p>For more than 20 years, the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC) has served as the sole credentialing body for the field of health education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912455176">NCHEC, 2008</xref>). During 1989, a charter certification phase was implemented, which allowed health educators to submit documentation for review to become a CHES, which is the entry-level certification in the field. NCHEC administered the first competency-based, national certification examination in 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912455176">NCHEC, 2008</xref>). Unlike many health professions, the field of health education determines competencies for contemporary practice and research by conducting multiphase, national research studies (role delineation or job analysis) to clearly define the model of practice for health education specialists. The results of the role delineation or job analysis studies inform the framework for academic preparation, practice, and the national certification examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912455176">NCHEC, Society for Public Health Education [SOPHE], &amp; American Association for Health Education [AAHE], 2010</xref>). To date, three such studies have been conducted: (a) the Role Delineation Project (1980-1985), (b) the National Health Educator Competencies Update Project (CUP; 1998-2004), and (c) the Health Educator Job Analysis (2008-2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912455176">NCHEC, SOPHE, &amp; AAHE, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912455176">2010</xref>). All three studies were multiphase, national research studies administered by health education–related organizations.</p>
<p>The Role Delineation Project resulted in a definition for the role of the entry-level health educator and revealed that regardless of setting (i.e., school, worksite, health care, community, university), all health educators shared a “generic role” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912455176">NCHEC, SOPHE, &amp; AAHE, 2010</xref>, p. 2). In later years, CUP was initiated to better refine and re-verify the entry-level competencies, as well as to validate advanced-level (graduate) Competencies, determined in the 1990s by the Joint Committee for the Development of Graduate-Level Preparation Standards, a committee commissioned by AAHE and SOPHE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912455176">NCHEC, SOPHE, &amp; AAHE, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912455176">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912455176">SOPHE &amp; AAHE, 1997</xref>). NCHEC, SOPHE, and AAHE, along with nine other health education–related organizations, were involved with the 6-year research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912455176">Gilmore, Olsen, Taub, &amp; Connell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912455176">NCHEC, SOPHE, &amp; AAHE, 2010</xref>). The outcomes of CUP indicated that there are indeed three levels of practice in the field of health education, with years of experience and degree being the differentiating factors. Entry-level practice is defined by less than 5 years of experience with a baccalaureate or master’s degree, and advanced 1-level of practice is one with 5 or more years of experience with a baccalaureate or master’s degree. Last, advanced 2-level of practice is defined as 5 or more years of experience with a doctoral degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912455176">NCHEC, SOPHE, &amp; AAHE, 2010</xref>, p. 4). Results supported that all health educators, regardless of level, practice within the Seven Areas of Responsibility: (I) assess individual and community needs for health education; (II) plan health education strategies, interventions, and programs; (III) implement health education strategies, interventions, and programs; (IV) conduct evaluation and research related to health education; (V) administer health education strategies, interventions, and programs; (VI) serve as a health education resource person; and (VII) communicate and advocate for health and health education. A number of competencies and subcompetencies were identified as being unique to practice at each advanced-level. Therefore, within a series of recommendations to the profession, SOPHE, AAHE, and NCHEC included a recommendation that health education professional preparation programs should prepare graduate students to perform all Seven Areas of Responsibility, along with the appropriate advanced-level competencies and subcompetencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912455176">Airhihenbuwa et al., 2005</xref>). In 2006, this recommendation was supported by the Coalition of National Health Education Organizations (CNHEO), which was made up of nine health education–related professional organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912455176">NCHEC, SOPHE, &amp; AAHE, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>With evidence resulting from the CUP to support three levels of practice in the field, discussions regarding the development of an advanced-level credential began to heighten. The National Task Force on Accred itation in Health Education recommended the development of an advanced-level credential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912455176">Allegrante et al., 2004</xref>). Support from stakeholders and leaders in several national organizations, led NCHEC’s leadership to support moving forward with a new, advanced-level credential for the field of health education. In May 2009, NCHEC’s Board of Commissioners issued a policy statement regarding the new credential, the MCHES; eligibility would align with CUP results and involve years of experience and the competency-based framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912455176">NCHEC, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>During the discussions regarding the development and implementation of an advanced-level credential, NCHEC learned that the CHES credential was granted accreditation by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies. One of the requirements within the National Commission for Certifying Agencies’ <italic>Standards for the Accreditation of Certification Programs</italic> is that the profession conducts a job analysis, with periodic validations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912455176">Institute for Credentialing Excellence, 2009</xref>). Therefore, the Health Educator Job Analysis (HEJA) was initiated in 2008 by NCHEC, SOPHE, and AAHE. In addition, a contracted vendor, Professional Exam Service, a national testing service, was used to help streamline and oversee the research process. The HEJA was completed in 2009, and the results verified the CUP findings. The hierarchical framework for practice still includes the Seven Areas of Responsibility, with three distinct levels of practice—entry, advance 1, and advance 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912455176">NCHEC, SOPHE, &amp; AAHE, 2010</xref>). The number of competencies changed slightly from 29 to 34. The number of subcompetencies changed from 82 to 162 entry-level and 81 to 61 advanced. In addition, 113 knowledge items were empirically validated for the first time. The results of the HEJA 2010 framed both the CHES certification, as well as the development of the new, advanced credential, MCHES.</p>

<sec id="section2-1524839912455176">
<title>Experience Documentation Opportunity Methods</title>
<p>A significant amount of time was devoted by NCHEC’s Board of Commissioners and Division Boards in developing the processes and policies for introducing the new MCHES credential. It was determined that prior to the implementation of the first MCHES examination, which would test individuals on the hierarchical entry- and advanced-level framework of practice, a onetime EDO would be implemented to allow those who had active CHES status, for 5 or more years, to submit documentation of advanced-level practice to be considered for the MCHES credential. The review process established by NCHEC provided an unbiased review for applications. The reviews were based on the policies and procedures developed by the NCHEC Board of Commissioners (11 elected certified individuals and 1 appointed public member, who serve as part of the governing body of NCHEC). NCHEC’s Division Board of Professional Preparation and Practice (DBPPP) developed the documentation forms for the EDO process.</p>
<p>The EDO process involved applicants submitting a resumé to verify years of practice at the advanced level; moreover, NCHEC required applicants to include a “testament of practice” by individuals who could verify the applicant’s practice at the advanced level. Specifically, interested applicants for MCHES certification were required to meet the following eligibility and approval requirements:</p>
<list id="list1-1524839912455176" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Must be an active CHES for at least five (5) continuous years prior to inauguration of the EDO process (certified on or before October 1, 2005)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Must submit the following documentation to NCHEC:
<list id="list2-1524839912455176" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>An EDO application form, which consisted of a two-page form that requested information, such as the applicant’s name and contact information, CHES number, job title, educational background, recommenders’ names and job titles, and optional fields such as: referral source to MCHES, work setting, job requirement for MCHES employment, and other demographic information.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A curriculum vitae or resumé—highlighting advanced-level work experience during the past 5 years (limit of five pages)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A written explanation (100 words or less) of experience in four advanced-level health education subcompetencies—each different and in four different Areas of Responsibility—within the past 5 years. Each of the four advanced activities had to be linked to one advanced subcompetency in the corresponding Areas of Responsibility.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Documentation (limit of three pages) for each of the four advanced-level health education activities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Two completed recommendations from a current or past supervisor and/or leader in a health education professional organization to verify the applicant’s involvement in the four, documented advanced-level health education activities.</p></list-item>
</list></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The EDO application form was submitted either online or via mail. All other materials were compiled by the applicant and mailed to the NCHEC office.</p>
<p>Once the application materials were received, the first step was an administrative review by an NCHEC staff member. This could result in denial of MCHES certification on administrative grounds, irrespective of recommenders’ review. Reasons for administrative denial included:</p>
<list id="list3-1524839912455176" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>The applicant did not meet the eligibility requirements (five year active CHES status) for the EDO process.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The application was not complete.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The applicant did not submit materials according to the deadlines and dates set forth by NCHEC.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>All documentation, including the self-appraisal and testament of practice forms and resumé, were reviewed by CHES certified NCHEC staff. The applicant was approved for the MCHES certification if two recommenders verified that the applicant was indeed practicing at the advanced-level (“competent”), with respect to the Seven Areas of Responsibility, and there was no significant variance with this overall rating and the criteria outlined to grant the MCHES certification. Meaning, the applicant’s materials met the criteria, as described in the EDO process, and the recommender’s overall rating supported the applicant to be approved; therefore, no inconsistencies between the recommender’s rating and the materials were noted.</p>
<p>Specifically, the materials were examined to ensure the applicant provided the following criteria: (a) identification of four advanced-level subcompetencies from four different Areas of Responsibility, (b) descriptions of health education activities linked to the identified subcompetencies, (c) documentation linked to the four identified activities, and (d) resumé documenting 5 years of health education experience. After completing the review, CHES certified NCHEC staff would either (a) approve the application meeting the above criteria or (b) refer for further review.</p>
<p>If referred, the next level of review was completed by a panel of at least three directors of NCHEC’s DBPPP. DBPPP review could have three possible outcomes: approval, denial, or request for additional information. Providing the recommenders indicated the applicant was “competent,” but a variance existed among any of the other approval criteria, the panel could issue a formal request for additional information from the applicant. In the event a recommender indicated he or she “could not judge” the level of practice, or testify to the activities documented in the application, the applicant was asked to provide another recommender prior to a decision being made.</p>
<p>After the formal request for additional information, submissions from the applicant were reviewed by CHES certified NCHEC staff using the same approval criteria as in the initial review. Again, the NCHEC staff would either (a) approve the application meeting the approval criteria or (b) refer for further review. If an application was denied, there was an opportunity for an appeal based only on the specified reason(s) for the denial of the MCHES credential. Applicants could not appeal eligibility requirements for the EDO process or policies and procedures required. Written appeals were forwarded to a review panel comprised of three MCHES eligible, NCHEC Board Commissioners or Directors. The review panel could take one of three actions: request more information, uphold the denial, or grant the appellant’s request. To grant the appeal, the ruling required a majority vote among review panel members. If the ruling was not a majority vote, the appeal was denied.</p>

<p>Results also revealed that EDO applicants work in a variety of settings; including: community, university, school, worksite, and health care. Within these settings, there are an array of employers and job titles. For example, within the community setting, applicants indicated working for state and county health departments, community and nonprofit organizations, universities, and federal agencies. In addition, the job titles ranged from epidemiologist to executive director, and provided insight into specific jobs within specific populations for specific health issues (i.e., pediatric and adolescent health educator, breastfeeding coordinator, asthma manager, bullying prevention specialist, drug overdose prevention educator, sexuality behavioral consultant, child birth educator, adult viral hepatitis prevention coordinator, work–life wellness coordinator, and chronic disease manager). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1524839912455176">Table</xref> provides a snapshot of the EDO results regarding types of jobs within the various work settings, and the most frequently documented job titles. Moreover, data revealed that a number of EDO applicants had university appointments, but self-reported their work setting as community or health care.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The EDO process of requiring professionals to document their level of practice, have recommenders attest to the level, and further assessment by a panel of reviewers proved to be a successful process for certifying health education specialists at the advanced-level. The process resulted in a relatively high (95%) pass rate, as 819 of 862 total applications were conferred MCHES. One potential explanation of the pass rate is that the rigorous process itself selected out those who could not successfully document advanced-level practice. The 7 individuals who self-selected to withdraw, prior to review, and the 21 who did not complete the process by providing documentation, could have potentially realized they were unable to document advanced-level practice. In addition, the process allowed applicants to address variances between the overall recommender rating and submission materials with criteria to grant the MCHES certification; therefore, this ensured the determination was based on the merit of the advanced-level practice and was not denied merely because of a misunderstanding of the requirements.</p>
<p>April 2011 marked the month in which the MCHES credential was awarded to the inaugural group. More over, the resulting EDO data provide valuable information on the characteristics of the first cohort of conferred MCHES. A majority of the MCHES EDO applicants were female (86%), Caucasian (73%), and had a master’s degree (53%). Comparing that data with information available of those holding the CHES certification, differences are evident. The percentage of males (13%) was higher for MCHES compared with 9% for CHES. Representation of race in the following categories, African American, Hispanic/Latino, and other, was a lower percentage in MCHES compared with CHES. For work setting, the MCHES had a higher percentage of university (36.8%) than CHES (20%) and other setting (19%) MCHES compared with (10%) CHES. In all other work settings, the percentage of MCHES is lower than CHES.</p>
<p>The most commonly used subcompetencies are an indication of the types of advanced-level activities in which MCHES professionals are mostly engaged; although, authors note that the ease of acquiring appropriate documentation of the advanced activities may have impacted selection of subcompetencies. Regardless, the EDO process provided a direct assessment of advanced-level practice in health education. The assessment further revealed job titles, within various work settings, that are occupied by those practicing at the advanced-level, and the information gleaned from this process can be used in ongoing reviews of health education practice and continuing education opportunities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839912455176">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>When comparing CHES with MCHES, an important consideration to note is that the demographic data for the MCHES population is more complete than the CHES population. All data are self-reported by the individual and stored in the NCHEC database. Because of changing needs for information and improved data collection and storage capabilities in recent years, those newly certified have more complete demographic information than those certified in earlier years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912455176">McKenzie &amp; Seabert, 2009</xref>). One of the benefits inherent in the MCHES EDO was that the process itself required submission of data that was inputted into the database, making the information on MCHES certified individuals more robust. For purposes of analysis, demographic information for CHES and MCHES could only be compared using the reported data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839912455176" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Examination of results from the EDO provided a rare look at the nature and extent of advanced-level practice of health education specialists. The concept of a “generic” health education practitioner, based on Areas of Responsibility, Competencies, and Subcompetencies was envisioned in the original role delineation which initiated the CHES credential. This concept, confirmed in the CUP and HEJA studies, has again been verified by the unique methodology of the MCHES EDO process. The applications and supporting documentation affirm the concept of the generic health educator/health education specialist across work settings, subject matter, populations, and job titles.</p>
<p>The EDO provided true insight into the <italic>eclectic role</italic> that the health education specialist plays in organizations and in the health field. The data on the varying types of jobs and employers, along with the most frequently documented advanced-level activities, support the notion that field of health education is made up of a diverse group of professionals. Results also support the concept that health education is a process-based field, in which professionals apply the responsibilities to design, implement, and evaluate theory-based health education programs across many settings and with many populations of interest. The process-based field allows for practitioners to be flexible to work across settings, subjects, and populations. While the diversity of work settings and job titles are encouraging in terms of varying options for employment, this diversity also suggests that the health education field is still in the process of building a unique and recognizable public identity. The opportunity now exists to use the data collected from the EDO in continued outreach efforts to employers regarding hiring certified individuals.</p>
<p>Finally, further analysis of the underlying causes and nature of the need to request additional information from EDO applicants is warranted to determine if misunderstandings of the Areas of Responsibility, Competencies, and Subcompetencies exist. Moreover, this analysis would provide insight into the need for additional training for improving understanding. Ultimately, the EDO process not only provided a rigorous process for certifying the first cohort of MCHES but also provided a snapshot of practice at the advanced-level, with the opportunity for future inquiry to answer questions (i.e., <italic>why the need for additional information requests?</italic>) that emerged as a result of the process.</p>
