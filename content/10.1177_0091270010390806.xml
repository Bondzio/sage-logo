<abstract>
<p>Most studies on safety/risk of drugs in pregnancy consider the proportion of births (but not pregnancy terminations) affected by the drug from all exposed infants. Lack of data on pregnancy terminations could bias results. A computerized database for medications dispensed to pregnant women in southern Israel was linked with records from the district hospital; 84 823 deliveries and 998 medical pregnancy terminations took place; 571 of the women were exposed to folic acid antagonists in the first trimester. When only births were examined, there was no association between folic acid antagonists and fetal malformations. When data on pregnancy terminations were examined and births and pregnancy terminations were combined, there was a significant risk (neural tube defects: odds ratio 18.83, 95% confidence interval 9.24-38.37; cardiovascular defects: odds ratio 3.86, 95% confidence interval 1.67-8.88; and neural tube defects: odds ratio 6.30, 95% confidence interval 3.34-9.15; cardiovascular defects: odds ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.05-2.92, respectively). Inclusion of only birth data in observational studies of drugs in pregnancy constitutes a source of bias toward the null hypothesis.</p>

<body>
<p>Because of obvious ethical limitations, prospective, randomized controlled studies of drugs in pregnancy are extremely rare. As a result, the vast majority of research on fetal safety of drugs is based on observational studies carried out after drugs have been marketed and pregnant women have used them. Typically, researchers try to estimate the rate of adverse fetal outcomes in an exposed group compared with an unexposed group (cohort studies) or the rate of specific exposures among children with birth defects versus children without (case control studies). Quite often these studies assess live births with or without stillbirth, as data on terminations of pregnancy are usually limited and are challenging to gather. Most studies also miss early pregnancy losses, which are often unrecognized.</p>
<p>The objective of the present study was to determine whether lack of data on terminations of pregnancy biases the results of studies dealing with fetal exposure to folic acid antagonists and, if so, the direction of such bias. For this we analyzed data on fetal exposure to folic acid antagonists, which has been shown to be associated with congenital malformations of the neural tube, the heart, and the urinary tract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010390806">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010390806">3</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-0091270010390806" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The population of the southern district of Israel is slightly greater than 500000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270010390806">4</xref></sup> Our retrospective cohort consisted of women aged 15 to 49 years, insured by Clalit Health Services (referred to here as Clalit). Seventy percent of the district women are insured by Clalit, which is the largest health maintenance organization in Israel. Practically all deliveries of the region take place at the district hospital, the Soroka Medical Center (SMC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270010390806">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The methods of this investigation have been described previously in detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010390806">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010390806">6</xref></sup> Data related to Clalit members are stored in a computerized database of Clalit and can be obtained to the level of individual members. The database includes information about date of dispensing of the medications, the Anatomical Therapeutical Classification (ATC) code (including the brand and generic names), and their dose schedules.</p>
<p>Additional information was obtained from 2 computerized SMC databases that drew data directly from original sources. A common SMC database, which includes demographic data and hospitalization dates, is created the moment the woman is hospitalized and the moment the infant is born; it is the direct origin of all SMC patients’ records. Information on maternal health status during pregnancy and delivery, maternal age, gestational age at delivery, perinatal mortality, parity, ethnic group, self-reported smoking status during pregnancy, and infant birth weight and Apgar scores are included in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department database. Diagnoses are reviewed by trained medical secretaries prior to entry into the database.</p>
<p>Another electronic SMC database that was used is the Demog-ICD9 database, which includes demographic and medical diagnoses during hospitalization. The Demog-ICD9 record includes additional coded infant diagnoses upon discharge. These diagnoses are classified by the <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</italic>.</p>
<p>Data on terminations of pregnancy were obtained manually from the SMC Committee for Termination of Pregnancies registry, after being encoded and linked to both SMC and Clalit databases by the women’s encoded identifying number.</p>
<sec id="section2-0091270010390806">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>The study cohort population consisted of women age 15 to 49 years of age, registered to Clalit and living in the Israel southern district, who delivered at SMC. A total of 117 960 deliveries took place during the study period (January 1998 to March 2007).</p>
<p>The above-described 3 electronic databases (1 from Clalit and 2 from SMC) and the terminations of pregnancy database were encoded and linked by the patient’s personal identification number, resulting in the origination of a registry of medications dispensed during pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes in the cohort.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0091270010390806">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>The exposed group consisted of women to whom folic acid antagonists were dispensed during the first trimester of pregnancy (up to 13 weeks of gestation). The first day of the last menstrual period was considered the first day of gestation. Folic acid antagonists included dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, which block the conversion of folate to its more active metabolites (such as trimethoprim, sulfasalazine, and methotrexate), and folic acid antagonists categorized as “other,” which produce low serum and tissue concentrations of folate because of different mechanisms (such as antiepileptics, like carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, primidone, valproic acid, and phenobarbital, and also cholestyramine).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010390806">7</xref></sup> Definition of exposure was dispensing of at least 1 of these drugs during the first trimester of gestation. The risks of congenital defects following exposure to folic acid antagonists during the first trimester of pregnancy were described in detail in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010390806">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The SMC databases provided the data on congenital malformations. Major congenital malformations were defined according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010390806">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010390806">9</xref></sup>; its definitions have been validated in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010390806">10</xref></sup> Chromosomal diseases were not included.</p>
<p>Potential confounders included in the statistical analysis were maternal age, parity, maternal reported smoking in pregnancy, maternal diabetes mellitus, and ethnicity (ie, Jewish or Bedouin Moslems).</p>
<p>We compared the crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (and 95% confidence intervals [CI]) for the risks of neural tube defects (NTDs) and cardiovascular defects (CVDs) after first-trimester exposure to folic acid antagonists drugs, first including only births (live and stillbirths), second including only medical terminations of pregnancy only, and third combining births and terminations of pregnancy.</p>
<p>The institutional ethics committee for human investigations approved the study. Written informed consent was not required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0091270010390806">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 14 (SPSS, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois). The crude risks for total major congenital malformations, NTDs, and CVDs of the exposed compared with the unexposed group to folate antagonists in the first trimester of gestation were estimated by OR (95% CI). Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the adjusted ORs for total major congenital malformations, NTDs, and CVDs. The models controlled for the following variables: maternal age (as continuous variable), ethnicity (Bedouins vs Jewish), maternal diabetes (yes vs no), maternal smoking during pregnancy (yes vs no), and parity (as number of births). Adjusted ORs (95% CIs) were computed from the logistic regression models.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Out of the 117,960 deliveries that took place at SMC during the study period, 84,823 were to women registered at Clalit. The exposure rate to at least 1 folic acid antagonist during the first trimester was 0.62%, consisting of 0.4% to dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (mostly trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and 0.2% to 1 or more other folic acid antagonists (mostly antiepileptic drugs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010390806">3</xref></sup> The dispensing rate of folic acid (a nonprescription medication) in the Clalit drug database during the first trimester was 22.3%. The cohort of women exposed to folic acid antagonists had a higher rate of folic acid dispensing (34.7%, n = 198) compared with those unexposed (22.2%, n = 18 934) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The folic acid dispensing rate in private pharmacies was not available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010390806">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The duration of prescriptions for dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors was 7.4 ± 5.7 days (mean ± standard deviation). Prescriptions were refilled at least once to 80.1% of the women receiving folic acid antagonist medications from the “other” category.</p>
<p>A total of 998 women underwent medical pregnancy terminations because of anatomical abnormalities of the fetus as detected by obstetric ultrasound scan and fetal echocardiography. Forty-four of the women had been exposed to folic acid antagonists in the first trimester of pregnancy.</p>
<p>The rate of 1 or more congenital malformations in abortuses and newborns was 5.3% (n = 4465).</p>
<p>The crude and adjusted risks for NTD and CVD following fetal exposure to folic acid antagonists are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091270010390806">Table I</xref>. When we included only births (live and stillbirths) in the analysis, exposure to folic acid antagonists was not found to be a significant risk for NTD (adjusted OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.13-2.06) or CVD (adjusted OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.44-1.94). When we examined the data of abortuses only, exposure to folic acid antagonists in the first trimester was associated with a highly significant risk for NTD (adjusted OR, 18.83; 95% CI, 9.24-38.37) and CVD (adjusted OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.67-8.82). When we combined the data for newborns (liveborns and stillbirths) and abortuses, significant risks for NTD (adjusted OR, 6.30; 95% CI, 4.34-9.15) and for CVD (adjusted OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.05-2.95) were found.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ratio of pregnancy terminations in the United States in the year 2005 was 233 per 1000 live births.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270010390806">11</xref></sup> The pregnancy terminations ratios per 1000 live births in 2006 were 246.4 in Europe and 133.8 in Israel,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270010390806">12</xref></sup> and the proportion of medical pregnancy terminations out of the total number of pregnancy terminations in Israel was 18%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270010390806">12</xref></sup> Pregnancy terminations may stem not only from medical risks to the mother and the fetus but also from psychosocial reasons, the most common of which are unplanned pregnancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270010390806">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinically significant causes of medical pregnancy terminations are intrauterine detection of a major malformation, serious inborn errors of metabolism, and fetal infections. If a specific malformation is caused by fetal exposure to a specific drug or chemical, it is conceivable that the proportion of exposure to this xenobiotic will be higher among cases of medical pregnancy terminations than among healthy babies. Not having access to such data may therefore bias the risk estimation.</p>
<p>For example, Ionescu-Ittu and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270010390806">14</xref></sup> concluded that folic acid fortification in Canada resulted in a decrease in the birth prevalence of severe congenital heart defects. However, that analysis included only live births and stillbirths but not data on terminations of pregnancy. During recent decades there has been an increase in the detection of fetal heart defects because of the availability of noninvasive detection methods such as cardiac ultrasonography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091270010390806">15</xref></sup>; this is likely to have led to an increase in the rate of data on terminations of pregnancy of malformed fetuses. As demonstrated in many NTDs studies, the prevalence of NTDs at birth has decreased in many countries. For example, it decreased by 93% in England and Wales between 1964 and 2004; 59% of this was attributed to a decrease in the incidence and a further 34% to an increase in terminations of NTD pregnancies following antenatal screening and diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010390806">16</xref></sup> In Israel, as in other countries where terminations of malformed pregnancies are legal (after approval by the institutional Termination of Pregnancies Committee), the percentage of pregnancy terminations attributable to NTD diagnosed during pregnancy has been between 40% and 79%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270010390806">17</xref></sup> Thus, it is clear that a decrease in the prevalence of severe congenital defects in newborns can be attributed to a reduction in malformed pregnancies as well to an increase of pregnancy terminations of malformed fetuses. Consequently, studies examining the association between intrauterine exposure to drugs and chemicals and malformations that do not include data on terminations of pregnancy are likely to suffer from major bias.</p>
<p>This hypothesis is supported by the present study showing that without data on terminations of pregnancy, a confirmed group of human teratogens (the folic acid antagonists) may not be detected from data on newborns.</p>
<p>The rates of neural tube defects vary greatly in European countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270010390806">18</xref></sup> In the southern district of Israel, approximately half of the infants are born to Jewish and half to Bedouin Moslem parents; significant differences in NTD incidence have been observed between Jews and non-Jews in Israel (11: 10 000 vs 22.3:10 000 live births, respectively) because of a combined effect of higher frequency of the malformations among non-Jews and a lower proportion of termination of affected pregnancies among non-Jews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091270010390806">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like other studies, fetal defects in our study cohort were detected through ultrasonography and fetal echocardiography. A large body of research has confirmed an overall high degree of agreement between ultrasound and autopsy findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270010390806">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The databases used in this study contained information regarding folic acid antagonists dispensed to pregnant women, but we have no direct knowledge about the degree of adherence with these medications. Published evidence suggests, however, that adherence to medications in the study population is good. We have found that rates of medication adherence were more than 90% in women with deep-vein thrombosis treated with enoxaparin and women with familial Mediterranean fever treated with colchicine (2 subgroups of our cohort).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010390806">7</xref></sup> It is reasonable that these high adherence rates can be generalizable to women treated with folic acid antagonists. Other studies have shown that computerized pharmacy records may be a good source of drug data, with high rates of agreement with self-reports of medications used generally by patients and particularly by pregnant women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270010390806">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091270010390806">22</xref></sup> Thus, as indicated by the high refill rate of prescriptions for folic acid antagonists that we categorized as “other,” a high degree of adherence is apparent in our cohort. Upon the finding of being pregnant and out of fear of risk to the fetus, some mothers may have elected not to refill their prescriptions.</p>
<p>As folic acid is a nonprescription medication bought not only at Clalit but also in private pharmacies in Israel, data on folic acid dispensed to women in this study were not complete. This being considered, we found that the rate of folic acid dispensed to women exposed was larger in exposed compared with those unexposed to folic acid antagonists.</p>
<p>Because more than 50% of pregnancies are not planned, many women who were exposed to a short course of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole probably were not aware of their pregnancy at the time of treatment, or they and their caregivers were not aware of the fetal risk of such medications.</p>
<p>Our sample did not have sufficient power to analyze trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole versus antiepileptics. Further studies should address potential differences between chronic versus acute (short) use of folic acid antagonists.</p>
<p>Results reported here are likely to be generalizable to studies dealing with fetal exposure to other drugs and chemicals during the critical periods of development.</p>
<p>During the last 2 decades researchers and clinicians have become aware of bias against the null hypothesis, whereby studies showing adverse fetal effects are more likely to be reported, potentially causing a false risk signal. This type of bias is presently addressed in conducting meta-analyses, by trying to estimate how many unpublished negative studies are needed to change a positive OR.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published report documenting a bias toward the null hypothesis in pregnancy drug studies using data on pregnancy terminations. The bias demonstrated by us in the case of exclusion of data on terminations of pregnancy points in the other direction. Indeed, most observational cohort and case control studies on fetal safety lack data on terminations of pregnancy.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated that exclusion of data on terminations of pregnancy introduces bias in the opposite direction. That is, when analyses do not include data on terminations of pregnancy, the potential teratogenic risk is diluted, thereby introducing the risk of missing a clinically important signal.</p>
