<title>Objective</title>
<p>To determine demographics and cost for outpatients undergoing parathyroid surgery at hospitals belonging to the University Health System Consortium (UHC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0194599812445551">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>UHC data were accessed in 2011 and reflected data collected from 2005 through 2010 (24 quarters). Searching strategy was based on diagnoses of parathyroid disease and patients undergoing parathyroidectomy across all UHC member facilities. Complications evaluated in this analysis included: hypocalcemia, hypoparathyroidism, aspiration pneumonia, hematoma, wound infection, stroke, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (PE), and death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599812445551">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The University Health System Consortium, Oak Brook, Illinois, was formed in 1984 and consists of 112 academic medical centers and 250 of their affiliated hospitals. This represents 90% of the nonprofit academic medical centers in the United States (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uhc.edu">www.uhc.edu</ext-link>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0194599812445551">
<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Patients enrolled in the UHC database were studied retrospectively. Data were compiled from discharge summaries into a secure, interactive, Web-based database. The outpatient data collection set has been a recent addition to the originally established UHC inpatient discharge database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812445551">
<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 21,057 patients who had outpatient parathyroid surgery. The average age was 59.0 (0.8-96.2) yrs. Seventy-six percent of patients were female. Outpatient parathyroidectomy had lower charges than inpatient surgery ($12,738 and $14,657, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.004, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Parathyroid surgery is increasingly being done in the outpatient setting in the United States. By virtue of omitting inpatient hospitalization, the outpatient approach becomes a more economical way to manage parathyroid disease. This is the largest known series reporting experience with outpatient parathyroid surgery.</p>

<body>
<p>The majority of parathyroid surgery in the United States is performed for adenomatous disease of a single gland. The safety and effectiveness of this surgery continue to improve with focused surgery, rapid parathyroid hormone assays, and anesthesia advancements. It has been shown that parathyroid surgery can be done safely on an outpatient basis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812445551">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812445551"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812445551"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812445551"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812445551">5</xref></sup> Even the elderly and the obese patient who were once thought to be more likely to require hospitalization have been shown to be as safe as others in a day surgery setting when surgery is done in a minimally invasive manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812445551">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812445551">7</xref></sup> One retrospective study of 33 patients undergoing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy in an outpatient setting showed the average cost of $3174.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812445551">4</xref></sup> Another prospective study comparing inpatient versus outpatient endocrine surgery including parathyroidectomy reported average costs of $2875 and $1991, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812445551">8</xref></sup> These small studies indicate that outpatient parathyroid surgery may well be a more cost-effective means of treatment of parathyroid disease than inpatient surgery or lifelong medical management.</p>
<p>The University Health System Consortium (UHC), Oak Brook, Illinois, was formed in 1984 and consists of 112 academic medical centers and more than 250 of their affiliated hospitals. This represents 90% of the nonprofit academic medical centers in the United States (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uhc.edu">www.uhc.edu</ext-link>). A wide range of data is compiled from discharge summaries into a secure, interactive, Web-based database referred to as Clinical Database/Resource Manager (CDB/RM). CDB/RM provides an expanded set of comparative demographic, charges, and procedural data as well as analytic tools to support the clinical operations of member institutions. Opportunities for improvement can be identified by comparison to benchmark data. Participating hospitals can benchmark openly with other hospitals by accessing this transparent, Web-enabled database.</p>
<p>The UHC data set has advantages over the better known Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, which reports on a limited population (26% of the total US population) from selected areas of the United States, is restricted to Medicare recipients (senior citizens), and focuses exclusively on cancer patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://seer.cancer.gov">http://seer.cancer.gov</ext-link>). The UHC collects from a broader population (4 million discharges in 2009) than the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Database (NSQIP). NSQIP had 336,190 cases submitted from 237 sites in 2009 and collects outcomes data for 30 days following discharge (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://site.acsnsqip.org">http://site.acsnsqip.org</ext-link>). Historically, NSQIP has focused on collection of data from patients with cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>There are several changes occurring in head and neck endocrine surgery. This surgery seems to be shifting from the inpatient to outpatient setting. Moreover, there are well-known, yet relatively infrequent, complications from parathyroid surgery. Reduction of these complications seems to be inversely related to a surgeon’s operative volume as well as the advent of minimally invasive approaches and new operative technologies.</p>
<p>Examination of a large database may allow for generation of reference data regarding the recent past history of parathyroid surgery and may provide a context for future changes in charges and complications. This information may also be useful for patients, providers, and policy makers in making decisions regarding use of the health care system for surgical treatment of parathyroid disease.</p>

<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Arkansas for medical sciences. Data from the UHC database were accessed in 2010 and reflected quarterly data collected from 2005 through 2010 (24 quarters). Search strategy was based on diagnoses of parathyroid disease and patients undergoing parathyroidectomy across all UHC member facilities that contribute both inpatient and outpatient data. We used procedure <italic>ICD-9</italic> codes and <italic>CPT</italic> codes. In some cases hospitals report one or the other, so we had to identify how it was reported and pull those respective codes. <italic>ICD-9</italic> procedure codes searched included: 068, 0681, and 0689. <italic>CPT</italic> codes searched included: 60500, 60501, 60502, and 60505. <italic>ICD-9</italic> diagnostic codes searched included: 252.02, 252.1, 275.41, and 275.42.</p>
<p>Demographic information was collected as well as charges. Complications evaluated in this analysis included: hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia, aspiration pneumonia, hematoma, wound infection, vocal cord paralysis, stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), deep venous thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), and death.</p>
<p>Charge data were analyzed for 2010 only and came from data collected from 169 member institutions that reported complete charge data for both inpatient and outpatient parathyroid surgery. Summaries that were provided for each institution included mean and median charge information.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics are reported for demographic and medical characteristics. Specifically, means and ranges were used to summarize continuous information, while categorical variables were summarized using counts and percentages. Because the institutional charge data were highly skewed, medians were used to summarize these data and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare the inpatient and outpatient settings. The analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina) and R version 2.9.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 21,057 patients who had outpatient parathyroid surgery. The average age was 59.0 (0.8-96.2) yrs. Seventy-six percent of patients were female. Reported racial breakdown included: Caucasian 80%, black 9%, Hispanic 3%, and 8% other.</p>
<p>The number of parathyroid surgeries being performed is increasing over time (approximately 267%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812445551"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>), even after limiting the data set to institutions that reported cases each year of the study (approximately 200%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812445551"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). The proportion of outpatient parathyroidectomy in comparison to inpatient surgery has also been increasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812445551"><bold>Figures 1</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812445551"><bold>2</bold></xref>). The increase in outpatient parathyroid surgery appears to be coming from an overall increase in this procedure combined with a shift of inpatients to outpatients. Outpatient parathyroid surgery is almost exclusively for adenomatous parathyroid disease (greater than 90%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812445551"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). More renal and other classified cases of hyperparathyroidism were treated as inpatients. These trends were maintained over the study period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812445551"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). There was a 0.2% incidence of synchronous thyroid cancer. There was a 0.3% incidence of postoperative hypocalcemia. There was a 4% incidence of postoperative hypercalcemia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812445551"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>All known complications were reported from our 21,057 outpatient data set. Complications searched included: myocardial infarction, wound infection, aspiration pneumonia, hematoma, unilateral vocal cord paralysis, bilateral vocal cord paralysis, cerebrovascular accident, and DVT. No documentation was found of any occurrences of MI, wound infection, aspiration pneumonia, bilateral vocal cord paralysis, DVT, or stroke. There were 2 reported episodes of unilateral vocal cord paralysis, which represented 0.01% of the sample. There were also 2 cases of wound hematoma (0.01%) and 59 cases of hypocalcemia (0.28%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812445551"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A challenge with UHC data is that each admission to discharge event (inpatient or outpatient) is kept as a discrete record. If an outpatient is admitted, he or she could present to another UHC facility or a non-member institution and data would not be linked to the original surgery unless it was searched. Therefore, complications presenting in this way would not be known to an investigator searching the database for outpatient procedures. If a patient returns for treatment of a complication to the same UHC institution where the procedure was performed, these complications would be detected. Also, known complications might be coded in alternative ways by coders, thus disguising their significance to a casual reviewer of the data. Following patients for complications is very important to have a realistic view of the advisability of doing any particular procedure in the outpatient setting. Consequently, we searched for our outpatients by their UHC unique identifiers for 30 days following their procedure to examine for repeat hospital encounters in any UHC facility that may have resulted from their outpatient procedures.</p>
<p>Common complications for parathyroid surgery appear to be underreported by our results. This likely resulted from diagnosis of complications being made in the outpatient clinic (unilateral vocal fold paralysis), which might not report to a central electronic medical record. These data are not dumped by member institutions into the UHC database even if the outpatient clinic encounter occurred in a hospital-based clinic because a hospital discharge drives the data transfer. Many of these outpatient encounters occurred in private offices with standalone or no electronic medical records.</p>
<p>Another challenge with the UHC data is that it reports charges. Charges are not costs. Charge data can be manipulated to arrive at an approximation for cost, but this was not done in this article. This methodology has been better established for UHC inpatient data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812445551">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UHC is a consortium of university hospitals and their affiliates. The results cannot be extrapolated to the full US population. This database, however, is quite broad and well populated, which might overcome its limitation of representing tertiary care facilities and their affiliates. Academic settings may have inflated charges due to their teaching mission. This makes the use of cost methodology very significant. The same clinical problems can be coded differently by coders, which highlights another of the shortcomings of database research where data are obtained from multiple contributors. Additionally, many codes are entered retrospectively by coders and not as they occur by treating clinicians.</p>
<p>Parathyroid surgery is increasing overall and being done more in the outpatient setting in the United States. Same-day surgeries are increasing with respect to overnight stays; however, the reasons for the across-the-board increases are not clear. By virtue of improved surgical technique, anesthesia technique, hemostatic methods, and calcium management, parathyroid surgical procedures can be done safely.</p>
