<sec id="section1-1071100712460364">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes after surgery for displaced intra-articular fractures using an external fixator and minimal internal fixation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712460364">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>In this retrospective observational study, a total of 39 patients (32 [82%] men and 7 [18%] women) with 48 displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures were included. An extended lateral approach was used to stabilize fractures using multiple sagittal plane screws, axial percutaneous threaded Kirschner wires for the frontal fracture plane, and an external fixator for reduction assistance and maintenance. The following variables were assessed: preoperative and postoperative Böhler’s angle; calcaneal length, height, and width; postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores; and complications. Mean duration of follow-up was 74 ± 26 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712460364">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The mean time from surgery to external fixator removal was 12 ± 1 weeks. The mean preoperative Böhler’s angle (–3 ± 21 degrees), calcaneal length (7.9 ± 0.6 cm), and calcaneal height (3.6 ± 0.5 cm) were significantly increased (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) at final follow-up (28.3 ± 6.5, 8.3 ± 0.6, and 4.5 ± 0.5, respectively), whereas the mean preoperative calcaneal width (4.2 ± 0.5) was significantly decreased from the final follow-up mean (3.8 ± 0.5). There were no significant differences between any of the normal and postoperative measures. The mean AOFAS score was 82 ± 12. Complications included superficial pin tract infection (n = 7, 15%), superficial wound edge necrosis (n = 4, 8%), and deep infection (n = 2, 4%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712460364">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that use of an external fixator with minimal internal fixation is an effective option for treating displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus as to the optimal means of treating displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460364">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460364">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460364">11</xref></sup> Conservative/nonoperative treatment is thought to be optimal for certain patient populations, namely the elderly and others for whom surgery is considered too risky.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460364">7</xref></sup> However, conservative treatment may be complicated by ongoing functional disability and pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712460364">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712460364">26</xref></sup> The most common surgical approach for treating intra-articular calcaneal fractures is open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Although the effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated in several studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460364">7</xref></sup> the published findings do not overwhelmingly support the use of ORIF over conservative treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460364">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712460364">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, ORIF has been associated with a variety of potentially serious complications, including wound dehiscence, necrosis, and infection, in 1.8% to 27% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460364">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another surgical approach for treating displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures involves external fixation. External fixation, usually applied in conjunction with percutaneous or closed reduction, may decrease the risk of complications associated with the more invasive ORIF approaches. A number of different surgical approaches involving various means of reduction and external fixation have been found to be effective for treating intra-articular calcaneal fractures in small-scale studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460364">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460364">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460364">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460364">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460364">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460364">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460364">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712460364">28</xref></sup> Although external fixation has been found to be efficacious, many of the studies thus far have involved the use of complicated external fixation devices such as circular or ring fixators. Herein, we describe our experience using a novel surgical approach for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fracture repair, consisting of open reduction, structural bone grafting, and the use of a simple external fixator with minimal internal fixation.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>From October 1999 to February 2008, 51 consecutive patients with calcaneal fractures were treated operatively at our institution by a single surgeon (F.T.H.). Most patients sustained multiple trauma as detailed below. Of the 51 patients, 12 (24%) patients were excluded from our analysis; 4 (8%) had type III open fractures, 4 (8%) had extra-articular fractures, and 4 (8%) were lost to follow-up. Thus, follow-up evaluations were performed for 39 (76%) patients. The mean duration of follow-up was 74 ± 26 months (range, 18-114 months).</p>
<p>The 39 patients consisted of 32 (82%) men and 7 (18%) women, with a mean age of 43 ± 14 years (range, 22-77 years) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712460364">Table 1</xref>). The mechanism of injury was falling from a height in 34 (87%) patients, motor-vehicle accident in 4 (10%) patients, and blunt trauma from an explosion in 1 (3%) patient. Thirty (77%) patients had unilateral fractures, and 9 (23%) had bilateral fractures. The 48 fractures included 23 (48%) type II fractures, 21 (44%) type III fractures, and 4 (8%) type IV fractures. Associated injuries included 12 (31%) spinal fractures, 11 (28%) multiple fractures (including 7 spinal fractures), 5 (13%) lower extremity fractures, and 1 each (3%) of the following: upper extremity fracture, pelvic fracture, blunt abdominal trauma (and L2 fracture), hemothorax (and L2 fracture), and head injury.</p>

<p>Patients were initially treated with bed rest, elevation, ice packing, and compressive bandaging. Splinting materials were not used, and active muscular contraction of the injured foot was encouraged to decrease the swelling. Radiographic studies included calcaneal axial and lateral views and injured foot anteroposterior and oblique views. Computed tomographic scans were also performed. Fractures were classified according to Sanders’s classification system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712460364">22</xref></sup> Lateral and axial radiographs were examined to determine Böhler’s angle and calcaneal length, height, and width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712460364">Figure 1</xref>). Comparisons were also made between the injured and the noninjured foot, unless both feet were injured.</p>

<title>Operative Treatment</title>
<p>The operative procedure was performed when the swelling had subsided. Patients were placed in a prone position, and the affected limb was exsanguinated before application of a tourniquet. The ankle was elevated using a 30-degree foam wedge to facilitate eversion of the subtalar joint during reduction and fixation of the posterior facet. The approach began with a boomerang-shaped incision,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1071100712460364">29</xref></sup> creating a full-thickness flap deepened to the tuberosity, which was reflected anteriorly and superiorly. The subtalar joint was then everted (assuming the posterior facet was not seen) and 1 or 2 pieces of the comminuted and bulged lateral cortex were detached, allowing for detection of the depressed and anteriorly rotated lateral parts (Sanders II-IV) of the posterior facet at the collapsed neutral triangle area. The fractured lateral parts of the posterior facet were derotated and elevated, anatomically reduced with the medial part of the posterior facet under direct visualization, and fixed at the thalamic portion using 2 or 3 cancellous screws (3.5 mm). A triangular external fixator frame was temporally set using 2 half-pins in the distal tibia and 2 full pins in the calcaneal tuberosity. Both ends of the full pins were held by the assistant, and an even distraction force was applied posteroinferiorly to restore the Böhler’s angle and the varus-deformed tuberosity. A small bone elevator was inserted into the neutral triangle area to manipulate the fracture fragments and to facilitate reduction of the whole calcaneus. The bone defect was then evaluated, adequate cancellous bone was harvested from the posterior ilium (usually 10-15 cc), and the defect was autografted with particular attention paid to the crushed neutral triangle area. The detached pieces of lateral cortex were reattached, reduced anatomically, and held with lateral to the medial screws for fixation of the sagittal fracture plane. The external fixator frame was tightened and the ankle joint maintained in the neutral position. The forefoot was then mobilized, and the fracture stability was checked in the Gissane’s angle area. If fracture motion was apparent, the frontal fracture plane was transfixed percutaneously using 2 or 3 partially threaded Kirschner wires (K wires: 2.5 mm). Finally, the soft tissue flap was reduced, and the operative wound closed in 2 layers without a suction drain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1071100712460364">
<title>Postoperative Management</title>
<p>Patients were restricted to bed rest for the first 3 to 5 days after surgery, with the injured foot or feet elevated. Thereafter, patients were instructed on correct ambulation using crutches or a walker with toe-touch weight bearing. Patients were discharged once wound healing was complete and they were ambulatory. Outpatient department follow-up visits occurred weekly for 4 weeks upon discharge, during which pin tract condition was examined. Progressive weight-bearing exercise was initiated at this time. Oral antibiotics were prescribed if there was any suspicion of pin tract infection.</p>
<p>Patients were then seen monthly until the external fixator was removed approximately 3 months after surgery; walking aids were discarded 4 to 6 weeks later. Functional and radiographic evaluations were performed 1 year after surgery, and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460364">13</xref></sup> hindfoot scores were determined at the most recent follow-up visit. In cases of unilateral calcaneal fracture, AOFAS scores were calculated as follows: Ankle motion and subtalar motion of the affected side were compared with those of the normal side to evaluate the percentage of motion lost. In cases of bilateral calcaneal fracture, AOFAS scores were calculated as follows: Ankle motion and subtalar motion of the affected side were compared with assumed normal values (dorsiflexion = 20 degrees, plantar flexion = 50 degrees, inversion = 25 degrees, and eversion = 15 degrees) to evaluate the percentage of motion lost.</p>

<sec id="section10-1071100712460364">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Patient demographics were summarized as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and as number (%) for categorical variables. Radiographic variables were summarized as mean ± SD. Linear mixed model analysis with a Bonferroni pairwise comparison was used to compare the differences among normal, preoperative, and postoperative radiographic measurements. Differences were considered to be statistically significant when <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 15.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).</p>

<sec id="section11-1071100712460364" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Surgery was performed a mean of 11 ± 5 days (range, 5-23 days) after fracture (once soft tissue swelling had subsided) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712460364">Table 1</xref>). Most (75%) patients received structural autografts. The majority (82%) of participants returned to work or changed jobs after surgery. The mean time from surgery to external fixation removal was 12 ± 1 weeks (range, 9-15 weeks) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712460364">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The overall mean AOFAS score for the 38 patients was 82 ± 12 (range, 45-100). One patient with a unilateral fracture (Sanders type IV) who sustained paraplegia (due to fracture-dislocation of the L3 vertebral body) after a third-floor fall was excluded from this and all AOFAS calculations. The mean AOFAS score for the 29 (74%) patients with unilateral fractures was 83 ± 12 (range, 52-100). The mean AOFAS score for the 9 (23%) patients with bilateral fractures was 81 ± 14 (range, 45-100). According to AOFAS criteria, 41 (85%) fractures were associated with normal or mildly restricted ankle motion and 6 (13%) with moderately restricted ankle motion. A total of 32 (67%) feet had normal or mildly restricted subtalar motion, 14 (30%) had moderately restricted subtalar motion, and 1 (2%) had a subtalar arthrodesis.</p>
<p>Fractures successfully healed in all patients, and there were no instances of further collapse of the subtalar joint. Furthermore, the morphological characteristics of the whole calcaneus were maintained during progressive weight-bearing ambulation in all patients.</p>
<p>There were 13 (27%) postoperative complications, including superficial pin tract infection, superficial wound edge necrosis, and deep wound infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712460364">Table 1</xref>). None of the 7 (15%) instances of pin tract infection were associated with pin tract osteomyelitis or deep infection. Pin hole curettage occurred during external fixator removal in 3 (6%) instances of pin tract infection. Cultures were negative in each instance of pin tract infection, and all 7 patients recovered uneventfully after 3 to 5 days of oral antibiotic therapy. All 4 (8%) patients with wound edge necrosis recovered uneventfully (wounds healed) without further treatment. Two (4%) patients experienced deep wound infection 2 to 3 weeks after surgery. Both of these patients suffered multiple fractures, including Sanders type IV fractures. Treatment for infection included debridement, removal of external and internal fixators, and administration of parenteral antibiotics. Once infection was controlled, bone grafting was performed to repair bone defects associated with the removal of necrotic bone during debridement. The first of these patients subsequently developed subtalar arthritis because of fracture malunion. This patient underwent subtalar arthrodesis 1 year after the original procedure for pain relief. In follow-up assessment, this patient had the lowest AOFAS score (52 points) of all patients with unilateral calcaneal fractures. The second patient who experienced deep wound infection was paraplegic and did not undergo subtalar arthrodesis after bone grafting.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article we have described our experience using a novel surgical approach for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fracture repair: open reduction, structural bone grafting, and minimal internal fixation with simple external fixation. Other methods are not appropriate without open reduction since they cannot restore anatomical reduction of the posterior facet, with the result of posttraumatic arthrosis or arthritis. In addition, if the anatomical reduction of the posterior facet is not obtained, the surgical outcome is questionable. Indeed, in a previous study involving 200 AO plates, it was found that there were fractures in 8.2% of plates where the Y limb joined the main plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712460364">23</xref></sup> We found our approach to be effective for reduction of the calcaneus as indicated by notable improvements in Böhler’s angle and calcaneal length, height, and width at 74 ± 26 months after surgery.</p>
<p>A number of reports have described the use of external fixators to treat calcaneal fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460364">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460364">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460364">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460364">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460364">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460364">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460364">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712460364">28</xref></sup> Of the more recently published reports, those by McGarvey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460364">17</xref></sup> and Ali et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460364">1</xref></sup> describe techniques using indirect and minimally invasive reduction, respectively, and Ilizarov external fixators, whereas Roukis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460364">21</xref></sup> described a technique involving manual reduction and distraction with a triangular tube-to-bar external fixator. Further recent reports include that by Besch et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460364">5</xref></sup> who described closed reduction and use of a hinged external fixator, and that by Talarico et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460364">25</xref></sup> who described minimally invasive open reduction and use of an external ring fixator. Although these reports have described external fixation as being associated with favorable outcomes, the approaches used have various limitations including technical difficulty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460364">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460364">25</xref></sup>; increased operating time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460364">17</xref></sup>; extensive use of K wires, which may increase the risk of pin tract infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460364">25</xref></sup>; problematic reduction of the posterior facet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460364">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460364">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460364">25</xref></sup>; and complex external fixator design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460364">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460364">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460364">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460364">25</xref></sup> The approach described in this report overcomes several of these limitations, in particular that of a complex fixator design.</p>
<p>In the cohort of patients described in this report, we used external fixation with a simply designed fixator in conjunction with minimal internal fixation in an effort to eliminate soft tissue complications, maintain reduction, and minimize hardware irritation in the treatment of these complex fracture patterns. The keys to success in the treatment of calcaneal fractures include anatomical reduction of subtalar joint congruency, restoration of calcaneal shape, and careful soft tissue management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712460364">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712460364">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1071100712460364">29</xref></sup> With the technique described herein, a balanced traction force was applied through both ends of the full pins, allowing for easy adjustment of the varus or valgus of the deformed tuberosity and reduction of the entire calcaneus. This traction force may also work against the “constant deforming force of the Achilles tendon” previously implicated in anatomical reduction difficulty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460364">8</xref></sup> Equinus contracture is prevented and fracture reduction is maintained by the triangular external fixator frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712460364">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>We suggest that our approach has a number of advantages over standard ORIF. First, in the ORIF with plating, the plate is placed lateral to the calcaneus, where the soft tissues are very thin. Thus, the calcaneus and skin as well as soft tissues were separated by the plate, which may interrupt blood flow from the lateral calcaneal artery. Because this artery is the main source of blood supply to the surrounding wound in the extended lateral approach, interruption of lateral calcaneal artery may cause wound edge healing problem and avascular bone necrosis under the plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460364">2</xref></sup> Additionally, in the study by DeWall et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460364">10</xref></sup> the infection rate of the plate group undergoing ORIF was very high. All our patients remained in the hospital until wounds were healed. Another advantage of this technique is that casts, splints, or night boots are not required. In contrast, casts or fracture boots are often required after ORIF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460364">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460364">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712460364">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712460364">27</xref></sup> The lack of a need for casting is a particular advantage in subtropical regions such as Taiwan. Only 3 (6%) patients in our cohort complained of heel pad pain. We suggest that this low incidence of heel pad pain compared with standard ORIF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712460364">27</xref></sup> may have been a consequence of early postoperative ambulation with desensitization of the heel pad.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460364">18</xref></sup> A further advantage of our approach is that no implants were used other than the minimal internal fixation; only the screws remained after external fixator and K-wire removal. Importantly, no patients developed symptomatic hardware problems, and no secondary surgery was needed for implant removal. In contrast, symptomatic hardware problems requiring implant removal are not uncommon with standard ORIF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460364">10</xref></sup> A further advantage of our external fixation approach over standard ORIF is cost. Specifically, under Taiwan National Health Insurance regulations, the hardware cost associated with calcaneal fracture repair by minimal internal fixation with an external fixator is approximately $280 to $290, of which the patient pays 10%, whereas the hardware cost associated with ORIF using the AO Synthes calcaneal locking plate system is approximately $2200 to $2300. This latter cost is fully borne by the patient.</p>
<p>Although subtalar motion (6 points) is weighted less than is alignment (10 points) in the AOFAS grading system, subtalar motion is important for normal gait, especially on uneven surfaces. Leung et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460364">14</xref></sup> reported that more than 67% of active and 80% of passive subtalar joint motion could be retained after intra-articular calcaneal fracture repair by ORIF. The authors attributed this mobility to resection of the calcaneofibular ligament, rigid anatomical reduction, and energetic postoperative rehabilitation. In our study, excellent plantigrade foot alignment was achieved because of the application of an external fixator. However, a total of 14 (29%) feet in our study had moderate restriction with a loss of more than 25% of subtalar motion in the follow-up period. This leads to the question, does subtalar motion become limited after 3 months of external fixation? Soft tissue tension and compliance were restored during the initial application of the external fixator, which was beneficial for reducing swelling. Further shrinkage and contraction of the damaged soft tissues were limited by keeping the injured foot in a neutral position. The subtalar joint was constrained, but forefoot motion was possible,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460364">4</xref></sup> and subtalar joint accommodation was regained in most patients after progressive weight-bearing ambulation during external fixation. In contrast to Leung’s study, in which most patients had low-impact injuries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460364">14</xref></sup> the majority of the patients in our study had high-impact injuries resulting in broadening and flattening of the calcaneal bodies and severely traumatized soft tissues. This difference likely explains the higher proportion of patients with restricted subtalar joint motion in our study compared with Leung’s study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460364">14</xref></sup> and leads us to speculate that severely traumatized soft tissues may be the predisposing factor for limited subtalar motion in some but not all patients. The use of external fixation may also have contributed to restricted subtalar motion. Additional study is warranted to investigate these possibilities and identify the risk factors for limited subtalar motion.</p>
<p>In our study, 15% of the feet developed superficial pin tract infections, whereas 8% had wound edge necrosis. These rates of infection and necrosis are lower than those reported in previous studies involving external fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460364">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460364">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460364">25</xref></sup> We did observe 2 (4%) cases of deep wound infection. In both cases, infection was controlled after removal of external and internal fixators, antibiotic therapy, and bone grafting. For these 2 cases, both were Sanders type 4 with multiple injuries. The younger patient had paraplegia and presented with malnutrition during surgery. The older patient was a heavy smoker (1 pack of cigarettes per day) who later underwent subtalar arthrodesis; the same patient who had a deep wound infection exhibited fracture malunion, subsequent subtalar arthritis, and markedly restricted subtalar motion. The fracture malunion was likely a consequence of fracture reduction lost during debridement surgery following internal and external fixation removal. All other complications resolved uneventfully. In a recent study, DeWall et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460364">10</xref></sup> reported much higher rates of deep wound infection (14.3%) and other minor wound complications (21.4%) after ORIF. The low rate of complications in our study may be explained at least in part by the use of external fixation and minimal internal fixation. In the study by DeWall and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460364">10</xref></sup> the deep infection rate in the ORIF group was 6 of 42 (14.3%). In contrast, the deep infection rate of percutaneous reduction and screw fixation in our cohort was 0 of 83 (0%).</p>
<p>The use of bone graft in calcaneal fracture repair is controversial. Following completion of a prospective randomized study, Longino and Buckley<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460364">16</xref></sup> reported that bone graft offered no clinical benefit for intra-articular calcaneal fracture repair. In our study, unlike in traditional ORIF, structural bone graft was typically used to strengthen the crushed neutral triangle and provide mechanical support to the previously depressed thalamic portion. We found that bone graft increased fracture stabilization to the extent that K wires were not required in several cases.</p>
<p>Patients in our study had higher rates of concurrent spinal (31%) and multiple (28%) fractures than previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460364">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460364">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460364">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460364">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712460364">27</xref></sup> Furthermore, a lower proportion (59%) of our patients returned to their previous job after surgery and took a longer length of time off work (average 36 weeks) than previously reported. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460364">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460364">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460364">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460364">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712460364">27</xref></sup> The relationship between concurrent fracture and postoperative work status and time away from work warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Our procedure has a number of limitations and elicited several patient concerns. These included pin care and pin tract infection stress and the physical inconvenience of the external fixator. Furthermore, there is a risk of deep wound infection, as with any open reduction approach. A secondary procedure is required to remove both the external fixator and K wires; however, this procedure does not involve skin incision. From a patient perspective, however, this procedure is substantially cheaper than ORIF with AO Synthes calcaneal locking plate system, because in Taiwan the patient pays for hardware under the rules of the National Health Insurance, as detailed earlier.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. First, 4 patients treated using the approach outlined in this report were lost to follow-up. Given the relatively small number of patients included in the study, the outcomes for these 4 patients may have affected our overall findings. Second, we did not have a control group of patients who received nonoperative or standard ORIF for comparison. Including a control group would have allowed us to make general comparisons of efficacy and complications as well as more specific comparisons related to procedural and treatment features such as use of bone grafting and postoperative weight bearing. Comparison with other operative approaches, such as percutaneous fixation, is also warranted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460364">10</xref></sup> Third, we did not assess arthritis of the subtalar joint during follow-up.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we suggest that the combination of an external fixator and minimal internal fixation through the extended lateral incision is an effective approach, with reasonably low complication rates and reasonably good clinical outcome at 6 years, for treating displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures. A larger scale prospective study is needed to confirm our findings and directly compare outcomes with other surgical approaches.</p>
