<abstract>
<p>Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is a rare entity, especially in infants. The cervicothoracic region is the most commonly affected site in children. The clinical features are often nonspecific, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Early management is probably associated with better functional outcomes. Here the authors report a 12-month-old girl who presented with excessive irritability and weakness of limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging of spine revealed epidural hematoma on the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord in the C2–C5 region. There were no predisposing factors. She started showing neurological recovery even prior to presentation. She was managed conservatively. This case report aims to raise awareness about this otherwise morbid neurological emergency, in which early intervention is pivotal.</p>

<p>Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is a very rare entity, with an estimated incidence of 0.1 out of 100 000 per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811435241">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811435241">2</xref></sup> A review in 2008 documented only 2 cases in the first year of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811435241">1</xref></sup> Its presentation in infancy differs in several important ways from the more common adult variant and is probably underreported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811435241">3</xref></sup> We report a 12-month-old female child with a view to increase awareness about this neurological emergency, which usually has good functional recovery.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>This 12-month-old girl presented with excessive irritability for 2 weeks, floppiness of head, and weakness of limbs for the past 12 days. She had normal development prior to the onset of illness, as evidenced by her ability to walk several steps unsupported, rise independently from supine position, show well-developed pincer grasp, release an object when requested, speak in single words, and offer appropriate posture when dressing. Two weeks previously she had a sudden onset of excessive inconsolable irritability that persisted for 3 to 4 days. On the second day of illness, this was associated with retraction of shoulders, floppiness of head, and subsequent weakness of all 4 limbs with asymmetrical onset, having involvement of the right side before the left. The child spontaneously started recovering about 4 days prior to admission. She had no seizures, altered consciousness, squinting, feeding or swallowing difficulty, or respiratory difficulty. There was no history of fever, lethargy, accidental or intentional trauma, bleeding from any site, recent vaccination, or respiratory or diarrheal illness prior to onset. Examination revealed an irritable girl who was slightly comforted in her mother’s lap. She had generalized hypotonia and weakness. The muscle strength was 1/5 in the lower limbs, 2/5 in the left upper limb, and 3/5 in the right upper limb. Muscle stretch reflexes were not elicited in the upper limbs but were brisk in the lower limbs. There was no cranial nerve or sensory abnormality. Ocular fundus was normal. Systemic examination was also unremarkable. A head computed tomography scan obtained before she presented to us was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine showed a posterior epidural hematoma at the level of C2–C6 vertebrae on the left side causing obliteration of the thecal sac with mild indentation over the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811435241">Figure 1</xref>). The patient was further investigated after admission. Her coagulation profile, including prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and platelet count, was normal. Skeletal survey did not suggest child abuse. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging of the spine done 2 weeks after the first image showed resolving hematoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811435241">Figure 2</xref>). The child was managed conservatively in view of clinical and radiological recovery. At the last follow-up (around 3 months after admission), she had started sitting again unsupported with power of at least 3/5 in all 4 limbs. Her irritability had subsided.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma was first reported by Jackson in 1869 in a 14-year-old girl.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811435241">3</xref></sup> The usual age of occurrence is the fourth and fifth decades of life. A recent report documented a few pediatric cases with only 2 children less than 1 year of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811435241">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811435241">3</xref></sup> This is an important clinical entity to recognize, because whereas early treatment leads to good outcome, the condition is potentially fatal if undiagnosed. In a series of postmortem examinations of infants with sudden infant death syndrome, spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma was found in 10% of cases and was thought to be contributory to death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811435241">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Clinical characteristics of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma in children differ significantly from those in adults. In adults there is a clear male preponderance, whereas in children no such sex difference has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811435241">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811435241">6</xref></sup> Most of the hematomas are located in the thoracolumbar region in adults, whereas involvement of the cervicothoracic region, usually C5–T1, is more common in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811435241">3</xref></sup> In infants, the ratio of weight of head to that of body is disproportionately high. This, combined with increased cervical spine mobility and underdeveloped neck muscle control, probably explains the propensity of the cervical spine to be involved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811435241">1</xref></sup> Our patient had involvement of C2–C5, corresponding with maximum curvature of the cervical spine.</p>
<p>Bleeding in spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is thought to result from rupture of the valveless epidural venous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811435241">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811435241">7</xref></sup> The internal vertebral venous plexus is divided into anterior and posterior parts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811435241">8</xref></sup> The anterior part is closely attached to the posterior longitudinal ligament by firm connective tissue strands called Hoffman ligaments and is stable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811435241">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811435241">9</xref></sup> The posterior part courses loosely through the epidural fat, which extends laterally to surround the nerve roots. The sudden elevation of intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pressure induced by activities like crying, coughing, straining, or trauma can cause rapid increase in backflow into this valveless venous system, with the posterior unsupported part being prone to rupture. Hence, most spontaneous spinal epidural hematomas are located in the posterior aspect of the spinal canal and may extend into lateral gutters. Hematoma in our patient was posterior to the cord.</p>
<p>Risk factors for spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma include coagulation disorders; vascular malformations like venous angiomas, hemangiomas, or epidural varices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811435241">1</xref></sup>; and whooping cough.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811435241">10</xref></sup> Iatrogenic cases have been documented after lumbar puncture and epidural anaesthesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811435241">11</xref></sup> In fact, placing the patient in the knee–chest position for lumbar puncture may aggravate spinal cord compression in undiagnosed spinal epidural hematoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811435241">5</xref></sup> Our patient lacked any obvious predisposing factors, which is not unusual.</p>
<p>The clinical presentation depends on the speed of accumulation of hematoma, location, and volume as estimated by the extent of spinal segments involved. In children, the initial clinical features are often nonspecific and include irritability, abdominal pain or fullness, neck pain, rigidity or abnormal posture (torticollis or retrocollis), gait abnormality, and fever.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811435241">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811435241">7</xref></sup> Our patient had prominent shoulder retraction, probably because of irritation of brachial plexus and neck flop, in addition to irritability and limb weakness. In children, early clinical features are nonspecific, often leading to a delay in diagnosis. Several other, more common disorders are likely to present with acute-onset limb weakness and nonspecific features of cerebral, radicular, or motor unit involvement. These include, but are not limited to, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, immune myelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and, in endemic regions, poliomyelitis. Inflicted neurotrauma can have varied presentation and should always be excluded. Clinical assessment, spinal fluid examination, imaging of brain and spine, and nerve conduction studies including F-response testing and needle electromyography often constitute the initial workup and direct the clinician to further investigate the origin of the syndrome.</p>
<p>The determinants of neurological outcome include interval from onset of clinical features to surgery and the severity of neurological deficits at the time of surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811435241">1</xref></sup> Optimal time of surgical decompression from symptom onset has been described as within 12 to within 48 hours in adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811435241">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811435241">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811435241">13</xref></sup> However, most of the pediatric cases present later than this window of time. The time from symptom onset to surgery has ranged from 2 to 14 days in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811435241">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811435241">3</xref></sup> In our patient, there was an almost 2-week delay in seeking medical help. It is postulated that children have better functional outcome even with a delay in surgery of up to 2 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811435241">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Generally, laminectomy of the involved segments is considered the surgery of choice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811435241">5</xref></sup> However, there is a concern that laminectomy might limit normal development of the spinal column in children and may result in kyphosis, scoliosis, or tethered cord. Therefore, some authors have advocated laminotomy for decompression in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811435241">7</xref></sup> Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811435241">5</xref></sup> have performed laminectomy with reimplantation of lamina preserved in 1 piece with good outcome. Although spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is considered a neurosurgical emergency requiring prompt decompression to relieve the spinal compromise, there are a few instances that justify a conservative approach. These include a medically unstable child with coagulopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811435241">1</xref></sup> or, at the other extreme, a child with a very small hematoma with minimal and resolving neurological deficit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811435241">3</xref></sup> Our patient was managed conservatively in view of her clinical and radiological recovery.</p>
<p>To conclude, spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma presents with nonspecific clinical features in infants. A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis. It is a neurosurgical emergency, and early intervention is rewarding. Very few circumstances warrant conservative management.</p>
