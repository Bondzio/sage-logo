<abstract>
<p>Processes of involvement and representation are particularly important in UK public services if users’ interests are adequately to be taken into account. Yet there are several different, sometimes competing ways for users’ views to be represented, and their interaction is not well understood. This article reports on research exploring these issues in relation to three public services – housing, social care and leisure services. We asked, how do public service users experience and evaluate the alternative ways in which their interests may be represented, and what factors guide their ‘choice about voice’? Mechanisms available for users to express their views can be categorised as ‘hierarchical’ (e.g. contacting elected officials); individualistic (e.g. complaints procedures); or group-based (e.g. user forums). Users make assumptions about what channel is appropriate for particular issues in a particular context. However, their ability to communicate via their chosen channel is dependent on viable opportunities to do so. This idea of viability (or lack of it) goes beyond the simple provision of a full range of channels. It relates to the prospects of users' views being recognised and accepted – and to the sense of disconnection and withdrawal that often accompanies low expectations or disappointing experiences.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0952076710384903" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The involvement of citizens as users and consumers of UK public services represents an important arena for engagement in the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0952076710384903">Marquand, 2004</xref>). Recently, there has been a strong policy emphasis on ‘listening’ to citizens and service users, through both ‘choice and voice’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952076710384903">PASC (2005</xref>: 5) defines choice as ‘giving individuals the opportunity to choose from among alternative suppliers, whether or not entirely within the public sector’. Voice is defined as ‘giving users a more effective say in the direction of services, by means of representative bodies, complaints mechanisms and surveys of individual preferences and views’. Choice has received considerable attention in the recent literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0952076710384903">Greener, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0952076710384903">Le Grand, 2006</xref>). It is also a key feature of reforms such as ‘personalisation’ whereby, for example, direct payments and individual budgets in social care services have begun to transform citizen relationships with public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0952076710384903">Glendinning, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952076710384903">Glasby and Littlechild, 2009</xref>). As expressed through ‘exit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0952076710384903">Hirschman, 1970</xref>), choice can certainly send useful signals to providers so long as individuals do indeed have opportunities to choose from among viable alternatives. However, in many public services such opportunities are often absent or highly constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952076710384903">PASC, 2005</xref>). Moreover, while notions of choice invite images of public service users ‘shopping around’ for the best provider, the best appointment time, the best housing and so on, there is a range of other elements to people's relationships with the public services they use that must also be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0952076710384903">Clarke et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Our own recent research focused predominantly on ‘voice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0952076710384903">Hirschman (1970)</xref>. For some, voice might represent an attempt to extend the menu of choices available to service users, or to argue for choice where it is not currently available (what we might call ‘voice about choice’). However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0952076710384903">Simmons (2009</xref>: 58) argues, voice often goes beyond the confines of choice altogether, allowing people to express things such as the depth of feeling on an issue, or a sense of ‘membership’/solidarity/support. These differences reflect a variety of perspectives on the kinds of ‘public purposes’ and ‘social anxieties’ that people may emphasise at different times (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0952076710384903">Hoggett, 2003</xref>: 2). Voice is therefore important. It provides a way of tapping into a range of important inputs for public services: knowledges, ideas and individual/collective sentiment.</p>
<p>Evidence has suggested a general sense of disconnection and disengagement in this public domain, reflecting such underlying factors as the failure of politics and the political system to accept the new realities of ‘post-industrialisation’, and the replacement of ‘principle and ideas’ with ‘managerialism and public relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0952076710384903">Power Inquiry, 2006</xref>). The realm of public services provides one area where many people still perceive themselves as possessing a legitimate voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0952076710384903">Simmons et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0952076710384903">Birchall and Simmons, 2004</xref>). Yet similar factors can combine to alienate public service users, potentially leading them towards disengagement. Hence, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0952076710384903">Barnes (1999)</xref>, where such users express dissatisfaction it is over not only the nature of the services they are receiving but also their lack of control over them. Some argue that this sense of a lack of control is exacerbated by factors associated with recent public sector reform: first, commentators point to the greater fragmentation of the policy-making and service delivery environment in developments such as devolution, decentralisation, partnerships, and the ‘mixed economy of welfare’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0952076710384903">Powell, 2007</xref>). Second, commentators point to the effects of ‘new public management’ (NPM) reforms in the public sector that place an increasing emphasis on such notions as managerial autonomy, agency performance and a customer orientation (as opposed to ‘old’ public administration that emphasised standardisation, political co-ordination and professional control; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0952076710384903">Hood, 1991</xref>). It can be argued that the reforms of the last three decades have therefore led to cultural as well as ‘technical’ changes, with a change in the balance between different ways of organising (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0952076710384903">Newman, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Another way to view this is through the lens of citizenship, where these developments have potentially important implications. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0952076710384903">Lister (2006)</xref> identifies two issues. First, in order to have some yardstick against which to measure their claims, she argues that citizens need to understand the ‘universal’ rights that attach to the <italic>status</italic> of citizenship. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0952076710384903">Ellison (2000</xref>: para 3.3) points out, ‘state withdrawal makes way for multiple “spheres of publics”, the point being that in this pluralized environment there can be no “point of arrival” consistent with the development of a stable, universal citizenship of the kind anticipated in the post-war era’. Second, for people to be able to act as citizens, Lister argues that there is also a need for spaces in which citizenship can be grounded as a <italic>practice</italic>. Within public services, some argue that NPM reforms have enhanced this aspect of citizenship, others that they have diminished it. Hence, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0952076710384903">Christensen and Laegreid (2002</xref>: 283), ‘the “bottom-up” perspective implied by a customer-orientated system of public administration appears highly democratic and participatory. Its customers do have a potential impact on the amount, type and quality of service they are to receive’. Yet as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0952076710384903">Sjoblom (1999</xref>: 22) argues, ‘even if service arrangements related to NPM may increase consumers’ choice and efficiency, they may also limit the scope of democracy, or the sphere in which the citizen is able to act politically’. Notions of control are therefore controversial. Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0952076710384903">Skelcher (1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0952076710384903">Skelcher et al., 2005</xref>) observes that public service agencies generally remain less willing to offer involvement at the higher-order ‘discursive core’, than at lower orders of discourse.</p>
<p>These matters provide a backdrop to our study of the different channels by which service users communicate their views about public services. They underline the importance of how users see themselves when they use public services, and how they relate with both the services they use and with the people and organisations that provide them. Recent research has reinforced the relational differences that people feel when using public services; a sense of publicness that means it is ‘not like shopping’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0952076710384903">Clarke, 2009</xref>: 161). There are different elements to this. First, the extent to which public services provide collective as well as individual benefits is generally thought to be greater. Second, opportunities for exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0952076710384903">Hirschman, 1970</xref>) may be unavailable or too costly for many public service users. In either case, it has been argued that processes of involvement and representation (‘voice’) are particularly important in public services if consumer interests are to be adequately taken into account. Such processes are important both at the level of ‘issue framing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0952076710384903">Rein and Schon, 1991</xref>), and at the ‘social accounting level’ (‘the level of justification and explanation at which people find it necessary to explain to each other why they behave as they do’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952076710384903">Douglas, 1982</xref>: 201). This means that user voice is about more than simply complaining and seeking redress (important though this may be). User voice is often also focused on developmental aspects in relation to the service provided, where they might contribute to a process of co-production (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0952076710384903">Needham, 2008</xref>). In relation to public services, voice may therefore be prompted by a reactive dissatisfaction with aspects of service provision, or be directed towards collectively shared goals. However, there are several different, sometimes competing ways for consumers' views to be represented, and their interaction is not well understood. These mechanisms (or channels) provide the main focus of this article. We assess how service users make their ‘choice about voice’ and how far this reflects different expressions of their own agency, before considering the effects of the ‘listening environment’ in different public services.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0952076710384903"><title>Theorising voice in public services</title>
<p>Different assumptions and expectations appear to underlie the use of different channels for the expression of user voice. In this article we use insights from grid-group cultural theory to provide a framework for understanding how service users engage in ‘choice about voice’. Grid-group cultural theory has been developed as a tool for understanding cultural diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0952076710384903">Douglas, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952076710384903">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0952076710384903">Thompson et al., 1990</xref>). It works by plotting two dimensions against each other to create a four-fold field space (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0952076710384903">Figure 1</xref>). ‘Grid’ refers to the extent to which cultural environments are structured by rules and ascribed behaviour. ‘Group’ refers to the extent to which individuals are members of groups with well-defined boundaries.</p>
<p>The four positions in the grid-group framework represent different ideal-types, or ‘cultural biases’, that may be applied to the relationship between users and providers of public services. <italic>Hierarchy</italic> sums up a traditional, hierarchical relationship in which service users are dependent on experts to define their needs, and on administrators to make sure the service is delivered according to strict rules of eligibility. The service is overseen and regulated by local or central government politicians, through which individuals can seek redress. The expression of voice through any other channel would be regarded as undue influence, since the aim is to meet professionally assessed needs through rule-bound allocation procedures that treat everyone the same. <italic>Individualism</italic> is represented by market-based relationships, in which service users are constructed as rational, utility-maximising individuals, negotiating the role of consumer in such a way as to support their private needs and wants. The provider role is to match supply to this consumer demand, and to respond directly to feedback from individual service users. <italic>Egalitarianism</italic> is represented by ‘mutualistic’ forms of relationship, whereby users relate to the service through a sense of membership/ownership that confers rights (but also responsibilities) to express their views through collective processes. The final position is <italic>fatalism</italic>. Social relations here are capricious, and perceived to be imposed by external forces that are not well understood. The pressures on users to conform with any social group are weak, and they tend to consider the expression of voice as pointless – ‘its never going to change anything,’ they reason, ‘so why bother?’ However, fatalism can have important effects on user-provider relationships within the service system. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0952076710384903">Hood (1998</xref>: 9) observes, ‘a fatalist approach to public management will arise in conditions where co-operation is rejected, distrust widespread, and apathy reigns – a state of affairs which will be far from unfamiliar to many readers’.
<fig id="fig1-0952076710384903" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The grid-group matrix.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0952076710384903-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Grid-group theory provides a useful means of framing the public service context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0952076710384903">Hood, 1998</xref>; 6 et al., 2002). In particular, in line with the ‘requisite variety condition’ of the theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0952076710384903">Wildavsky, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0952076710384903">Thompson et al., 1990</xref>), we would expect elements of all four cultural biases to be present within the service system at any time (however attenuated any of them might be in any particular context). Recognition of the simultaneous presence of all four biases has advantages. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0952076710384903">Thompson et al. (1990</xref>: 96) put it, ‘regimes that have largely excluded a cultural bias lose the wisdom attached to that bias’. If user voice is seen as a ‘transfer of wisdom’, then each of the different strategies for its expression (with their accompanying assumptions and expectations) must be seen as important. This is what we sought to investigate in our research.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0952076710384903" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>Our main method was case study. We completed a ‘major’ and ‘minor’ case in each of three service areas: day care services (social care), leisure services and tenant management co-operatives (housing). Cases were selected not for their representativeness but in a purposive sample designed to cover a variety of experiences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0952076710384903">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Within each case, the first phase of the research involved in-depth semi-structured interviews with service users known to have expressed their views through different mechanisms: ‘hierarchical’ channels (e.g. contacting elected officials, ombudsmen); ‘individualistic’ channels (e.g. complaints procedures, direct personal communications); or ‘group-based’ channels (e.g. user groups, user forums, consultative committees). We also conducted in-depth interviews with staff, managers, local authority officers and elected representatives. In total, 80 service users and 30 provider representatives were interviewed. Documentary analysis supplemented the interviews. Documents included minutes of group meetings and the ‘complaints files’ in each organisation (including both written communications from users and the providers’ replies). In each of our ‘major’ cases, a second phase involved the conduct of face-to-face user surveys. A team of more than thirty interviewers were recruited and trained for this purpose, and a total of 543 surveys completed. Response rates varied between 45 and 55 per cent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0952076710384903">Figure 3</xref> shows who was interviewed and how the sample was determined.
<fig id="fig2-0952076710384903" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Criteria for case selection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0952076710384903-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig3-0952076710384903" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Sampling criteria.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0952076710384903-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Transcripts from the in-depth interviews were analysed (i) by individual respondent (‘summaries’), (ii) by question (‘grid analysis’), and (iii) according to selected ‘thematic codes’. In the first two stages, transcripts were read through to identify descriptive and inferential codes for classifying concepts and themes in participants’ statements. The aim was to allow the language and concepts of participants to guide the development of our coding schemes – to let the ‘voices’ of the respondents emerge. Next, transcripts were re-read to code each statement according to the scheme developed through the first two stages. Finally, the coded statements were subjected to pattern analysis to identify common themes and relate them back to our theoretical framework. Insights from this phase of analysis were then used to design the survey instrument and as an interpretative tool for the survey results. While our in-depth interviews helped to establish the range of users’ views and experiences, the survey was undertaken to investigate the distribution of these views. A range of descriptive and paired-samples statistics was therefore conducted for this purpose.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0952076710384903"><title>The expression of users’ views: understanding ‘choice about voice’</title>
<p>Most users and providers agree that voice is important. It provides a way of tapping into a range of valuable inputs for public services: knowledges, ideas and individual/collective sentiment. In a key finding from our research, over 70 per cent of service users in each of our three services said they had contributed their views in one way or another at some time or another. This ran contrary to the assumptions of much lower numbers by most service providers, but this is unsurprising: users often express their views through frontline members of staff, and providers acknowledge that the majority of this contact tends to go unrecorded. Voice is therefore extremely commonplace, and reflects people's sense of attachment to public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0952076710384903">Simmons et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0952076710384903">Simmons, 2009</xref>). Why do people feel this way? In short, it is because they feel a sense of ownership over public services; of having a stake. They also see public services as important and care about them being done well. Evidence for people caring about public services was widespread in our interviews with both users and providers.<disp-quote><p>I look after my premises. Can’t you see? I’d like the council office up the road to realise: ‘Oh, there is a tenant in that premises … someone who does care for the premises, who does care for the area and not just anybody who's paying rent. (tenant, m, 40 s)</p>
<p>There will always be a certain number of people that will complain because of personal circumstances of how they are feeling that day. But there are genuine people that will say ‘Look, that is not good. I like coming here, I want to keep coming here. Can you do something about it?’ And I think it is because they care. I know that sounds quite deep but I think generally they do, otherwise they wouldn't bother. (leisure services manager, m, 20 s)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In our survey 96.5 per cent of day care users, 89.8 per cent of leisure service users, and 66.1 per cent of tenants said they care either ‘a great deal’ or ‘quite a lot’ about the service (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0952076710384903">Figure 4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0952076710384903">1</xref></sup>.
<fig id="fig4-0952076710384903" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Extent to which users ‘care about’ the service.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0952076710384903-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Of course, different kinds of public services tend to be more or less central in the lives of those who use them. Also, the same public services are not as central in the lives of every user. Elsewhere we have suggested that, other things being equal, a service's importance will vary according to the intensity, continuity, and duration of users’ need for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0952076710384903">Simmons and Birchall, 2005</xref>). For example, episodic or short-term users may consider the service to be less important in the context of their lives than on-going and long-term users. However, where the service stands in people's lives on the span from ‘central’ to ‘peripheral’ is also important, and this depends at least in part on the link between the service and other important aspects of people's lives.</p>
<p>While people spoke about tangible ‘attributes’ (such as whether or not the floors were kept clean) when we asked them how they would know that the service was performing well, for many of our respondents it was the service ‘outcomes’ that made the service central to their lives. For example, a key benefit for many of our social care respondents was the sense of overcoming social isolation through their attendance at day centres. This extended the value of the service far beyond the immediate use of the service:<disp-quote><p>The service is ideal for me. It gives me company. And it encourages you to come out. You see, otherwise I would be sitting in the house staring at the television and I would just about be going out of my head. Company is the number one for me, definitely. This is the highlight of my week. (day care service user, f, 70 s)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>People told us how public services had helped to open up new vistas for them. The service had served as a springboard to other things.<disp-quote><p>Before, I never got out. I was a right scared-y cat until I came here. There are things that, if I didn’t experience them here at the day centre, I wouldn’t have ever done them in my life. So it's opened up a whole avenue of trying things. Now, I’ve tried so many different things, I think ‘Yes, I can do it’. So that's what it's done for me. (day care services user, m, 30 s)</p>
<p>I had a tumour taken off my spine, I have always been a good swimmer, and the minute I could walk far enough to get on a bus, the pool is the first place I went. And I truly believe I would not be getting about like I am without that pool every morning. It's everything to me, it really is. (leisure services user, f, 60 s)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, leisure service users told us how their use of the service had become connected with other important life goals. For many users this made the idea of stopping their use of the service almost unthinkable.</p>
<p>Hence, while it may be the case that there are different relationships that service users have with the three services that were the focus of this study, each service was important to its users in relative (if not absolute) terms. What each of these services share in common is that users’ perception of ‘having a stake’ provides an important starting point for the expression of voice (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0952076710384903">Hirschman, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the implicit and explicit notions of stakeholding evident in many of our respondents’ responses, however, it is worth noting that it would be wrong to say that the majority of users want to spend a substantial part of their lives thinking about the public services they use. For the majority, there is a sense that people want providers to take the lead – but crucially <italic>not before</italic> they have listened suitably to what users have to say. While in general service users do tend to trust providers to take the lead in running public services, this trust is limited and conditional, not absolute. Users often feel a need to keep their eye on the ball, and to make sure that important matters do not go unchallenged. This has implications for the nature of ‘stewardship’ in public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0952076710384903">Donaldson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0952076710384903">Denhardt and Denhardt, 2000</xref>), reflecting a desire for both ‘leadership’ and ‘listening’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0952076710384903">Simmons, 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0952076710384903">Needham, 2001</xref>). This requires that there are channels or mechanisms through which users are able to exercise ‘voice’.</p>
<p>Users are generally able to choose how they express their views about public services from a range of options. In this study we investigated these ‘voice mechanisms’, each of which reflect different categories within the grid-group framework:
<list id="list1-0952076710384903" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Hierarchical oversight mechanisms (e.g. elected representatives, senior officials, ombudsmen) <italic>(hierarchy)</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Individualised mechanisms direct to service providers (e.g. suggestion schemes, complaints procedures, direct personal communications) <italic>(individualism)</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Group-based mechanisms (e.g. user groups, user forums) <italic>(egalitarianism)</italic></p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Analysis of the first-phase in-depth interviews allowed the range of circumstances that might prompt the use of different voice mechanisms to emerge. In the survey, we were then able to investigate the extent to which users felt these circumstances applied to them (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0952076710384903">Figure 5a</xref>).
<fig id="fig5-0952076710384903" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>(a) Circumstances that prompt the use of voice. (b) Circumstances that inhibit the use of voice.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0952076710384903-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Overall, voice is widely intended to increase the likelihood of action (e), reflecting notions of success-oriented, ‘instrumental’ and ‘strategic’ actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0952076710384903">Habermas, 1984</xref>). Here, users are more likely to use voice about on-going problems (b) than one-off problems (a), reflecting a degree of trust in providers to put one-off problems right ‘without needing to be told’. However, other circumstances that stimulate user voice include gaining a better understanding of how the service works (f) and discussing new ideas (g). These aspects reflect notions of ‘communicative’ action, where ‘the actions of the agents involved are co-ordinated … through acts of reaching understanding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0952076710384903">Habermas, 1984</xref>: 285–6). Overall, individualistic mechanisms are considered the most appropriate for discussing one-off problems (a), on-going problems (b) and getting recompense (c). Hierarchical mechanisms are considered the most appropriate for campaigning against major change or closures (d), but are also important in discussing on-going problems. Groups are considered the most appropriate for gaining a better understanding of the service (f) and discussing new ideas (g). Interestingly, groups are also considered the most appropriate to meet service users’ key objective – increasing the likelihood of action (e) – in both leisure and day care services.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0952076710384903">Figure 5b</xref> shows the survey findings regarding the circumstances that might inhibit users from expressing their views through these mechanisms. The most common of these across all three services is a sense they would not be listened to (k). This is an important finding, observed in more than one-third of service users (although the figure is lower for individualised and group-based mechanisms in day care services). It suggests that there is more to do for service providers to demonstrate to users that they listen carefully to what they have to say. Other observations are more service-specific. Day care users also tend to be more concerned about causing bad feeling with the staff (j), a common finding in social care research that reflects the perceived power relationship felt between service users and those providing that service. Leisure service users are more concerned that voice takes too much time (l), reflecting the busy lives of highly active people. In our housing case, tenants are more likely to feel that they would be made to feel small (n) if they express their views through individualised and hierarchical mechanisms. This may reflect the relationships of people living in a marginalised community to authority (whether managerial or political).</p>
<p>Our semi-structured interviews provide additional detail. Support for hierarchical mechanisms is built on users’ belief in the legitimacy of hierarchy to act on their behalf, especially where they do not believe they have a strong enough voice on their own. Hierarchy is also often seen as a second ‘port of call’ if initial communications are unsatisfactory (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0952076710384903">Thomas, 1995</xref>).<disp-quote><p>There is a point where you should deal with it yourself. You shouldn't just keep saying ‘Oh councillor do this, MP do that'. You should actually stand up and take it on yourself. And then if you are not getting satisfaction you think ‘Hang on a minute, I am being overpowered here, or not being heard’. Then take it further. (leisure services user, m, 40 s)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the use of hierarchical mechanisms is not always about complaining, or taking a complaint ‘to the top’. For example, we found that people are often keen to speak to their elected representatives about developmental, resource allocation and policy issues. They are particularly keen to see money spent wisely, staff effort directed appropriately, and policies developed that are both fair and effective.</p>
<p>Individualised mechanisms are used to communicate a personal perspective on service issues, although such communications are not necessarily self-oriented – they are often focused on issues of collective concern. Documentary analysis demonstrated that these mechanisms are also used to give positive/negative reinforcement to providers: either praise or, more often, criticism (linked to a range of potential sanctions). Users can be quite strategic about how they utilise individualised mechanisms. One group of users had organised to deliberately send around twenty individual letters rather than one letter countersigned by them all. This was intended to ensure that their issue ‘registered in the complaint statistics, so they [the providers] had to take notice of us’. In another instance small group of users had sent individual letters in support of a valued element of the service. In interviews, they admitted that they perceived this element of the service to be threatened, and had hoped to persuade service managers not to cut it by ‘lavishing it with praise’.</p>
<p>Group-based mechanisms provide an interesting alternative, tending to be valued as an opportunity both for shared learning/shared problem-solving, and for providing ‘strength in numbers’. Groups provide a relatively egalitarian space in which people can discuss issues openly, share information and experiences and learn together. In reality, this sense of egalitarianism is to some extent dependent on how the group is convened. Some groups are convened by local government or service provider representatives, while others are organised by service users themselves. Groups that are organised by service users themselves are common. Some perspectives suggest that these may be quite radical, using their shared identity and common sense of purpose to campaign for their objectives on their own terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0952076710384903">Barnes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0952076710384903">Beresford, 2009</xref>). There was some support for this in our research, particularly in the tenant management organisations and user groups for adults with physical disabilities that we spoke with. However, the experience of our research showed that another perspective could also be applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0952076710384903">Turner, 2008</xref>), with many groups being more interested in the positive characteristic of resolving on-going and emergent tensions between themselves and service providers through interaction (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0952076710384903">Simmel, 1964</xref>). Often this is focused on the ‘co-production’ role, where users seek to discuss both technical and political issues and solutions with service providers. User-led groups may therefore send representatives to speak for them at committees/forums convened by local government or service providers. However, this can lead to the possibility of power imbalances being used to exert disproportionate influence between members of these committees/forums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952076710384903">Barnes et al., 2007</xref>). For example, a committee/forum convened by a local authority in which hierarchical power relations continue to be exerted will probably still be more strongly hierarchical than egalitarian. However, it is now beginning to be recognised (and is certainly a lesson from the current research) that for group-based mechanisms such as committees/forums to achieve their purpose, it is important that members are prepared to give equal weight to the views of each individual around the table – no matter what power their role might give them outside the group. Contextual and/or political factors will often decide whether users’ expectation of influence in these interactions is based on the mobilisation of radical power or on the mobilisation of ideas and knowledge. Our research suggests that this will reflect the extent to which providers are prepared to treat the committees/forums they convene as more or less egalitarian.</p>
<p>Our survey showed support to be high amongst service users for these group-based mechanisms, but actual participation to be much lower. A more detailed investigation of our data revealed two reasons for this. First, there is a need to better understand the importance of how such participation might be facilitated, including the three elements of what we have previously called the ‘participation chain’: overcoming resource barriers, providing appropriate opportunities, and appealing to people's dominant motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0952076710384903">Simmons and Birchall, 2005</xref>). This facilitation was noticeably lacking in our leisure services case in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952076710384903">Simmons et al., 2007b</xref>). Ensuring that all that want to participate can participate is clearly important to democratic goals. However, ‘maximum feasible participation’ is not a prerequisite for effective involvement. Our research shows there is often a considerable degree of trust invested by users in those of their number who are prepared to participate and represent the user perspective in group-based mechanisms.<disp-quote><p>I: Do you trust the TMO to always act in your best interests as a tenant?</p>
<p>R: Oh I think so, yes. Because on the committee there is not just one person there is, like, a few people who think of different things and they are putting their views and then everyone gets something to say about it, you know. It is for a variety of people. As long as you have got a variety of people then you have got different views and awareness of things. (tenant, f, 50 s)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This is underscored by the firm grounding gained from their direct experience of using the service that is shared in common between all service users; a perspective that is often considered to be lacking in other stakeholders (such as service provider representatives).<disp-quote><p>One doesn't really see the staff using the facilities … If the staff actually came in and participated a bit, and understood why we think the showers aren't as good as the old showers, for example, I think that would be a way of being aware – that management occasionally sampled, alongside the customers, what was happening. (leisure services user, m, 60 s)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, we found that users strongly support having a full range of opportunities for voice. On average, around 85 per cent supported having hierarchical mechanisms, 89 per cent individualised mechanisms, and 79 per cent group-based mechanisms (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0952076710384903">Figure 6</xref>). This was in spite of the fact that not all of them would consider using these channels – the corresponding figures here are 48 per cent, 78 per cent and 51 per cent.
<fig id="fig6-0952076710384903" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Support for different voice mechanisms.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0952076710384903-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>On a personal level, our interview respondents felt that knowing it was possible to express their views through mechanisms other than their ‘preferred’ channel was important, even if they currently had little intention of doing so. This is consistent with a good deal of psychological research showing that people often consider the opportunity to do something to be as important as actually doing it. Looking beyond their own self-interest, however, respondents also recognised that everybody has their own way of expressing their views, and that in principle the opportunity to go about this through a range of channels was something to be promoted and/or defended.</p>
<p>Awareness of the availability of the different mechanisms outlined above is generally high amongst service users, although some are clearly better informed than others. Users are also quite discerning about what strategy is appropriate in what circumstances.<disp-quote><p>I always try to pitch my enquiry or suggestion at the appropriate level. So I took it that the ‘Ideas and Implementation Group’, by the very name of the group, was the group that I should be targeting to achieve the desired effect … If I went even higher up and went to my member of Parliament, I’ve no doubt that they would try and help me but then you have to address the enquiry at the appropriate level. (day centre user, m, 50 s)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This ‘logic of appropriateness’ may be the result of institutionalisation; that is, people internalising the way they have been told to behave in a certain context. However, it was clear that in none of our cases had a great deal of institutional effort been devoted to such matters. Indeed, despite the fact that the different options are sometimes set out formally in ‘service charters’ (which also attempt to predetermine the routes that users should follow), neither users nor providers pay much attention to such documents. Reform processes have also often left public service institutions in flux, and users reliant on previously learned ‘habits of the heart’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0952076710384903">Baldock and Ungerson, 1996</xref>, after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0952076710384903">Bellah et al., 1985</xref>). User ‘choice about voice’, is therefore just as often linked to a more personal set of dispositions, reflecting notions of ‘linguistic habitus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0952076710384903">Thompson, 1991</xref>, after Bourdieu, 1977).</p>
<p>More specifically, users have different norms, values and beliefs about what is ‘fair’. For example, those who favour group-based mechanisms see as fair an open and inclusive approach in which anybody can come to a meeting and expect to be listened to equally. Meanwhile, those who favour individualised mechanisms point to the fact that not everybody can make it along to meetings: it is fairer to make available opportunities for users to record their views through personal communications or universally accessible feedback systems. Users also have different norms, values and beliefs about what is ‘sufficient’. Hence, those who favour group-based mechanisms acknowledge the value of individualised mechanisms such as a universally accessible tool, but claim that they are ‘not enough’ as they do not allow for processes of two-way discussion and debate. Similarly, those who favour individualised mechanisms are broadly supportive of group-based activity, but question whether they are enough on their own, due to the limited numbers of users who are able and willing to attend group meetings. In this way service users often tend to be ‘biased’ towards one form of ‘voice’ rather than another, which can lead to frustration if opportunities to express their views through their preferred channel are not perceived to be viable.<disp-quote><p>I think there is a feeling that one can talk things through and that several people can voice their opinions in a group. Whereas if you write a letter … in some ways a letter seems more formal. If you are having a debate, you can always say ‘Well I can see what your problem is or whatever it may be’. The two way thing, I think, is much more useful than just writing a letter. (leisure service user, m, 60 s)</p>
<p>What I object to is that only the people who attend on a Tuesday are the people who are really consulted about how the centre runs. I spoke to the chair of the group about it and basically the manager is inflexible, he's not prepared to meet on any other day. And as someone who only comes on a Monday and a Wednesday, I think I am being disenfranchised. Of course, I am a bit more articulate than some of the clients that come to the centre, and I’m able to put pen to paper. But that's not good enough, it's just not good enough. (day centre user, m, 50 s)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Sometimes ‘blindspots’ are evident in relation to particular voice mechanisms – despite being aware that a particular mechanism is technically available to them, users say it is a route they would not normally consider following. However, this does not mean that they do not see such routes as necessary or legitimate.<disp-quote><p>I: Did you ever think about contacting your local councillor about the service?</p>
<p>R: No I never thought of it. It never crossed my mind.</p>
<p>I: Was that because you didn't know who they were or was there another reason why it wouldn't have even crossed your mind to do that?</p>
<p>R: I certainly don't know who they are … I have to say right away that I think the council does a really fabulous job … So the fact that I never thought of it …  I guess Iwould think that it was too high. You know, this is a kind of ‘macro management/micromanagement’. He is looking at different, bigger things. He doesn't have time for issues like this … I’m glad to hear the question though, because if I thought the thing was really going to pieces I might do that, contact the councillor. (leisure services user, f, 50 s)</p></disp-quote></p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0952076710384903"><title>Involvement and agency: the dynamics of ‘choice about voice’</title>
<p>The basic dynamics surrounding ‘choice about voice’ are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0952076710384903">Figure 7</xref>. While these dynamics are most easily understood in relation to reactive dissatisfaction with aspects of service provision (or ‘complaining behaviour’), they can also be applied to more on-going, co-productive activities. With the onset of a service issue (whether ‘technical’ or ‘political’), users reflect on whether to express their views or not. If they are sufficiently motivated and have a sufficient sense of agency to act, they may communicate their views through one or more of the available channels. Their messages are accompanied by expectations over process and/or outcome.
<fig id="fig7-0952076710384903" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Basic dynamics of ‘choice about voice’.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0952076710384903-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It is worth noting here that people told us that they did not always expect to be given what exactly they were asking for. Equally important was a process that reassured them that their views had been taken seriously and given due consideration, even if this made no eventual difference to the outcome.<disp-quote><p>It was just … you know when you do something that's slightly silly and you do it every day and it slowly annoys you, and you say ‘Why don’t we do it that way?’ … Well that's what happened with this particular system … They sent me a letter saying thanks for the comment, but I don’t think they could implement it. I mean I understand that maybe it's not that easy for them to do, so I didn’t necessarily expect them to, but I am thinking the next time they are going to redesign or re-develop, they could just do it, you know. (leisure services user, m, 20 s)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, in some cases, due process meant ensuring that other people's views had been taken into account before action was taken, even if this meant that the outcome was different from that one favoured by a particular user.<disp-quote><p>I was swimming for seven years and I loved it. And then suddenly they started to play music in the pool. I really blew my stack – I couldn't bear it. So I went to one of the lifeguards and said ‘I really don't like this’. And then he went and turned it off. And I felt terrible because I thought, you know, ‘what about everybody else … how does he know [what they think]?’ So there I was, I felt really embarrassed. And then I asked a couple of people, you know, in the pool, and said did they mind the music? And they said ‘no’. So I felt I had exercised disproportionate influence. (leisure services user, f, 50 s)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, in some cases, due process meant ensuring that other people's views had been taken into account before action was taken, even if this meant that the outcome was different from that one favoured by a particular user.</p>
<p>If users’ expectations are met when they express their views, they are generally satisfied and all is well. If their expectations are not met, the dynamics become more complex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0952076710384903">Figure 8</xref>). First, users may reflect further and either send a fresh communication via the same channel (‘persistence’; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0952076710384903">Craigforth, 2003</xref>) or utilise a different channel (‘strategy switching’; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952076710384903">Rayner, 1999</xref>). We found that strategies of persistence, switching and the simultaneous use of multiple channels for voice are not uncommon. This was as much the case for one-off complaints as it was for more on-going developmental service concerns. However, equally commonly users decided not to pursue the matter further. Sometimes they told us that the issue was not a high enough personal priority; sometimes that the providers generally did a good job and they didn’t want to rock the boat; sometimes that no other users seemed bothered about it and they didn’t want to take up the issue alone. In these situations they preferred to simply drop the issue and move on (‘accommodation’: cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0952076710384903">Pickering, 1995</xref>). For those users interested in co-production rather than a single service event, this meant moving on to the next item on the on-going service agenda.
<fig id="fig8-0952076710384903" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Expectation versus experience in users’ ‘choice about voice’.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0952076710384903-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>For a significant minority of users whose experience of expressing their views did not match up to their prior expectations, the issue remained ‘live’, but their expectations of voice had become negative; they saw little point in pursuing further action. For these users, as for those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0952076710384903">Figure 7</xref> whose expectations are negative at the outset, the remaining option is withdrawal. Withdrawal occurs where users remain within the service system and still feel they have something to say, but feel ‘blocked’ from saying it. At the level of the individual, it represents the fourth dimension within grid-group theory, that of fatalism, characterised by a perceived lack of agency, a sense of futility and a sense of isolation. In sociological terms, people who withdraw become ‘holdouts’ (i.e. alienated from the service system) or ‘escapees’ (i.e. people who currently find exit from the system unfeasible, but who would take the first feasible opportunity to leave) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952076710384903">Homans, 1961</xref>). This lowering of commitment and concomitant withdrawal of trust and support can have serious implications for policy-making and service delivery. First, there are implications for day-to-day system control, whereby it is harder to gain service users’ consent. Second, it may eventually result in ‘leakage’ from the service system in one of two ways: what we have characterised as (i) ‘reluctant exit’ (whereby users cross a tolerance threshold, leading to the abandonment of the public sector for private sector services), or (ii) ‘exit without alternatives’ (whereby people prefer ‘no service’ to a ‘poor service’).</p>
<p>The above trajectories reflect the ‘alternative accounts of agency’ offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0952076710384903">Hoggett (2001</xref>: 38) in relation to social policy:
<list id="list2-0952076710384903" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the creative, reflexive welfare subject (e.g. those expressing voice)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the subject's refusal of agency (e.g. becoming a holdout or escapee)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the subject's assertion of forms of agency which are destructive toward self and/or others (e.g. ‘reluctant exit’/‘exit without alternatives’)</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Certainly, the concept of agency is an important one in establishing the perceived viability of opportunities for voice. This idea of viability (or lack of it) goes beyond the simple provision of a full range of channels. It relates to the prospects of users’ views being recognised and accepted. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0952076710384903">Lister (2001)</xref> points out that ‘one of the achievements of the disabled people's movement has been to win recognition of disabled people as <italic>subjects or agents</italic> in welfare policy-making and implementation, as opposed to their more traditional construction as simply the <italic>objects</italic> of policy’ (emphasis added). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0952076710384903">Emirbayer and Mische (1998)</xref>, agency is characterised by three inter-related components: habit, judgement and projectivity. We have noted the importance of ‘habits of the heart’ in guiding users’ choice about voice. Voice is also often based on the judgements that users form about public services, as we explored in the previous section. However, our analysis also points to the expression of voice as ‘projectivity’. Such projects represent ‘possible future trajectories of action in which received structures of thought and action may be creatively reconfigured in relation to actors’ hopes, fears and desires for the future’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0952076710384903">Emirbayer and Mische, 1998</xref>: 971). Hence, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952076710384903">Archer (2003</xref>: 6), ‘a project is a human device, be it individual or collective … it involves an end that is desired, however tentatively or nebulously, and also some notion, however imprecise, of the course of action through which to achieve it’.</p>
<p>Personal resources (e.g. time, money, skills/education, confidence) help to support users’ sense of agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0952076710384903">Verba et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0952076710384903">Simmons and Birchall, 2005</xref>). However, users also need to feel that public service organisations are receptive. As we have examined elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952076710384903">Simmons et al., 2007b</xref>), emergent structural and cultural factors in the service environment play an important role here. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952076710384903">Archer (2003</xref>: 8) argues that such structural and cultural factors can exercise powers of constraint or enablement. However, she also points out that:<disp-quote><p>First, such powers are dependent on the existence of human projects; no projects mean no constraints or enablements. Second, to act as an enabling or constraining influence there has to be a relationship of congruence or incongruence respectively with different agential projects. Third, agents have to respond to these influences, which being conditional rather than deterministic, are subject to reflexive deliberation over the nature of the response.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Archer's assertions fit well with the model we have presented of ‘the dynamics of choice and voice’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0952076710384903">Figure 6</xref>. Ideas of constraint and enablement also help show why the simple provision of a full range of channels is insufficient for perceptions of viability. Hence, we found that even where public service organisations have ostensibly elaborate involvement processes, users often report them to remain remarkably impervious to the input from these processes.<disp-quote><p>I would write to the council – and I love this council – but, you know, I’d write to the Leisure and something services. And they would send me a letter back. And it would always say that I was the only one who had complained, or, you know, that that was just a one off thing … It was always a very patronising answer back … I felt they were covering up whenever I wrote to them. I didn't feel that they were saying ‘Oh, we are really sorry about this Mrs. [X]. We will try and see if we can sort it out’, or … you know? Or some discussion with me, so I felt it was a bit patronising and it was a bit of a cover up – ‘we must keep these people safe’. I felt they were on the side of the Leisure Centre, and that they just wanted it quiet – you know – ‘just keep quiet and it will be all be alright’. (leisure services user, f, 60 s)</p>
<p>I: Were you disappointed with the response that you received?</p>
<p>R: Yes. Although it was polite and prompt, I thought if they had said ‘we are looking into it again’, then I would have been disarmed, you know, I would have had to shut up. It was the fact that they didn't even say they were going to consider it. So I thought this was authoritarian – rigidity and all that – and it is not accomplishing anything.</p>

<p>R: Nothing, I didn't think I had … there was no other option to me.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0952076710384903"><title>Cultural analysis and user voice</title>
<p>Cultural values direct people's attention to what is more and less important, while cultural norms define what is appropriate and inappropriate behaviour. This is supported by the institutional structures of public service organisations. Institutions preserve cultural values and norms, give them authority, and provide a context for social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0952076710384903">Brett, 2000</xref>). Yet cultural values and norms are <italic>both</italic> institutionalised in social systems <italic>and</italic> internalised in the personalities of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952076710384903">Parsons, 1991</xref>). The preference of users for the use of one channel or another to express their views is based on their personal set of norms, values, beliefs and attitudes. We have characterised these as ‘cultural biases’. However, service users get their values and norms from a variety of places, so it cannot be assumed that they will conform to those of public service providers. If the values and norms institutionalised in public service organisations are compatible with those internalised in service users there is ‘cultural congruence’. If they are incompatible, there are ‘culture clashes’.</p>
<p>Users were asked in our research to describe how the service ‘actually is’ compared with how it ‘ought to be’ on a range of indicators. This helped to clarify the extent of ‘culture clashes’ or ‘cultural congruence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952076710384903">Simmons et al., 2007b</xref>). The indicators used for this task were based on the prior analysis of our 80 in-depth user interviews, such as: courtesy and respect; how knowledge is valued; how fairness and equity issues are resolved; and how rules are set and policed. The results showed that much depends on the approach taken within each service context. In only one of our cases (day care) could there have been said to be <italic>cultural congruence</italic>. Here the balance between what ‘is’ and what ‘ought to be’ was relatively close. Interestingly, we also observed a very balanced approach to providing choice about voice in this setting. Service users were quite aware of their ability to express their views through either hierarchical mechanisms such as their local councillor or the Care Commission, their individually allocated care worker, or one of the user groups convened regularly within each day care centre.</p>
<p>We discussed earlier the presence of cultural ‘blindspots’ in some service users, but these were also apparent in service providers. In our leisure services case, for example, when we asked users to compare what ‘is’ with what ‘ought to be’, there was a noticeable blindspot in relation to groups. This fits well with our other data from this case – formal user groups had been established in previous years but they did not sit comfortably with service providers and had later been withdrawn. As one manager openly stated.<disp-quote><p>‘You have got the possibility of a quango being generated, a little tight-knit club that seems to have a lot of power. There was no way I was going to let that happen’.</p></disp-quote>Leisure service providers tended also to be cautious about groups that organised informally within their facilities. Facility managers seemed particularly wary of ‘early morning swimmers’ as being somehow radical and/or subversive. Because these swimmers typically arrive at the opening time of the swimming pool and share the swimming facilities together on a regular basis, they tend to get talking to one another about matters of common interest. This can lead to requests being made to managers for changes and improvements to the pool and its ancillary facilities from what might be seen as a fairly legitimate group. However, this can also be regarded as challenging by service managers. They therefore prefer to treat early morning swimmers as separate individuals rather than as a collective entity, even where the swimmers have deliberately organised collectively. Badminton players often met with similar disapproval, for similar reasons.</p>
<p>In our housing case there were two blindspots of note. Tenants reported lower levels of congruence between how the service ‘is’ and how it ‘ought to be’ in relation to both the individualistic and group-based dimensions. This again was borne out in interviews and in other data collected in this case. Unsurprisingly, this also tended to mean that tenants in this setting were more fatalistic. This was reflected in a lower sense of control – of being less able to ‘have a say and make a difference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0952076710384903">Simmons, 2009</xref>). As one tenant put it:<disp-quote><p>There have been occasions when they’ve been putting on a show, but the thing is you can tell. They’re backing away from you all the time. They’re not going to stand there and tell you what's going on … I’ll wait for the day when all my problems are over. But now I’m just waiting for the day when I next sit and put pen to paper again, go over the same old ground, the same old requests and the same old non-acknowledgement.</p>
<p>Interviewer: That must make you feel a little bit … </p>
<p>Despondent to say the least.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>When they sense that the values underpinning the service are not compatible with their own, this can also lead users to reflect on whether or not to raise their voice. Hence, our findings show that the different channels need both to be open and the reception clear if users are to be persuaded that the opportunities are viable. The absence or blocking of certain channels leads to voice being stifled and opportunities for organisational learning being missed. Such blocking reflects both (i) structural relations of power within the service system and (ii) the power of hegemonic discourse to legitimate inequalities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952076710384903">Barnes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0952076710384903">Davies et al., 2006</xref>). Over time, a sense that service providers are only interested in talking amongst themselves then holds the danger of disconnection and withdrawal – as has been noted already in wider political life (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0952076710384903">Power Inquiry, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Culture at the ‘front line’ is important, but it is also important who holds the power. As we have pointed out, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0952076710384903">Skelcher (1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0952076710384903">Skelcher et al., 2005</xref>) suggests that public service organisations reserve to themselves discussion of ‘higher order’ issues, and that user voice is sought only at lower levels of discourse. The strength of providers’ power relative to users enables them to control the agenda. If the use of power becomes coercive and domineering, this adds significantly to the potential for resistance and/or withdrawal over time.</p>
<p>Providers must therefore think about the styles and strategies they employ as they interact with users. In the same way that users have ‘choice about voice’, providers have ‘choice about dealing with voice’. Sometimes, providers find the user voice to be advantageous in supporting their own arguments for either change or defence of the status quo. However, if providers do not agree with users on an issue, it can be difficult to bring them to terms.<disp-quote><p>There was just a culture of ‘we won't do it if we don't feel like it’. And it really takes some getting rid of. (leisure services user, f, 40 s)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>How can common ground be established, if users’ and providers’ views of the world are incommensurable? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0952076710384903">Pellizzoni (2001</xref>: 79) argues that there are four alternatives: delegation (where authoritative decisions are made by particular elites; i.e. hierarchical), strategic negotiation (where stakeholders trade or bargain with one another; i.e. individualised), ‘overlapping consensus’ (where stakeholders find ways to reach a mutual agreement even if their reasons for agreeing may be different; i.e. egalitarian), or separation (where the different parties decide to terminate their interaction, i.e. withdrawal).</p>
<p>It should not be assumed that service users are always happy to delegate decision-making to particular provider elites (or ‘hierarchies’) – even if there is evidence that this is sometimes the case. As we pointed out earlier, there is a sense that people want providers to take the lead – but crucially <italic>not before</italic> they have listened suitably to what users have to say. Where users felt that the opportunity to have a say and make a difference was denied to them, withdrawal or separation became more likely. For example, those who did not feel that there were good opportunities to express their views were more likely to be fatalistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0952076710384903">Figure 9a</xref>), and to see their relationship with the service provider as negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0952076710384903">Figure 9b</xref>). Another possibility in the face of opportunities to have a say and make a difference being denied to them was that user group activity might be based more on the mobilisation of radical power as a way of getting a ‘foot in the door’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0952076710384903">Simmons, 2009</xref>).
<fig id="fig9-0952076710384903" position="float"><label>Figure 9a.</label><caption><p>(a) User evaluations of opportunities to express views v. fatalism. (b) User evaluations of opportunities’ to express views v. nature of user-provider relationships.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0952076710384903-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A lack of connection with service users’ hopes, expectations, dilemmas – indeed all the elements of the human condition – can serve to create perceptions of a lack of ‘institutional responsiveness’. The role of institutional design is important in addressing these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0952076710384903">Simmons et al., 2006</xref>). We argue that organisations need to be more reflexive about their flexibility and responsiveness to the user voice. Yet, as we have pointed out, many public service organisations still appear to remain remarkably impervious to user input. We therefore argue for a more careful consideration of the extent to which the institutional arrangements are balanced in relation to ‘leadership’ and ‘listening’.</p>
<p>In seeking greater congruence between users’ perceptions of what ‘is’ and what ‘should be’, it would seem advantageous for greater efforts to be made to listen to people. Crucially, this means better understandings of how people want to be treated as individuals; how they want to be treated as members of collectivities; the role they see for hierarchy; and the extent to which they have become fatalistic. Such understanding can then be utilised to review matters at the institutional level, in terms of both ‘lower order’ issues of policy and practice, and ‘higher order’ issues of values and attitudes. Importantly, if they wish to retain users’ support, our findings show that public service leaders can little afford to allow themselves to become disconnected.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0952076710384903" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study set out to establish whether public service users want choice about voice, what kind of choice they want, and what the implications of this are for policy makers and service providers. Grid-group cultural theory provided a useful framework for delineating the different ways in which user-provider relationships were forged. This included the way that some users were able and willing to express their views through a range of voice mechanisms, but also the way that others became fatalistic and withdrawn.</p>
<p>Our findings show that 70 per cent of users express their views in one way or another at some time or another. Despite the fact that people have a tendency to prefer one channel for expressing their views, there is strong support for the provision of a full range of mechanisms to be made available. This is sometimes self-oriented, allowing strategy switching if they are frustrated in the use of their preferred channel. However, it is also other-oriented, based on recognition of the fact that not everybody feels comfortable expressing their views in the same way, and the idea that everybody should be able to communicate their views in the way that suits them best. This suggests that a full range of mechanisms for users to express their views should be provided. However, in itself, this is not enough. The different channels need to be kept open by service providers, but reception of user voice through these channels also needs to be clear. This means providers should ensure that they ‘tune themselves in’ correctly to be able to listen.</p>
<p>The research shows that resistance to hearing the user voice through one mechanism or another should be controlled if negative culture clashes are to be avoided. This includes the risk of fatalism and withdrawal. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0952076710384903">Verweij (2004</xref>: 3) observes, ‘each of the four cultures has its contribution to make … three of them are fragile, but the culture of fatalism is resilient and takes over when one of the other cultural viewpoints is repressed”. The causes of withdrawal therefore need to be considered and addressed before its consequences become more widely felt by public service organisations. We contend that the pursuit of greater cultural congruence is a valuable organisational goal, and that a combination of appropriate institutional design and an investment of institutional effort is required to ensure a more balanced and culturally congruent approach.</p></sec>
