<p>Good things come in small packages. Part of the TV Milestones Series published by Wayne State University Press, <italic>Sex and the City</italic>, by Deborah Jermyn, is a five-by-seven-inch book that deserves a spot on any bookshelf devoted to cultural studies, media, and women’s issues.</p>
<p>Jermyn’s study includes an introduction (“Four Women and a City”) and four deceptively brief chapters, “Making <italic>Sex and the City</italic>: ‘Authorship’ and Ensemble Television Production,” “‘You See Us, Manhattan? We Have It All!’: <italic>Sex and the City</italic>, Women, and Television Comedy,” “New York Stories: Representation and the City in <italic>Sex and the City</italic>,” and “Goodnight, Ladies: The Legacy of <italic>Sex and the City</italic>.”</p>
<p>Although being a fan of popular culture can keep a scholar from achieving critical distance, Jermyn’s immersion in <italic>Sex and the City</italic> (<italic>SATC</italic>) instead contributes humorous, lively, and provocative prose and a worthy critical study of the wildly popular and controversial HBO series. A senior lecturer in film and television studies at Roehampton University in London, Jermyn teaches courses in contemporary Hollywood, fictional forms, film history and criticism, and the representation of women, all of which energize her analysis of <italic>SATC</italic> and explain her decision to place the television series in a broad cultural and historical context.</p>
<p>With degrees in film, literature, television, and cultural studies, Jermyn is in her element, assessing <italic>SATC</italic>’s critical and popular success and predicting its cultural impact in a study that was published five years after the final episode aired. Jermyn unpacks her favorite episodes and evaluates existing criticism without showing her hand: at no point do readers slog through anything resembling a lit review. Jermyn’s interviews with stars and producers and her references to existing <italic>SATC</italic> bus tours, fan guides, and Web sites further brighten the analysis.</p>
<p>Jermyn weaves three major threads throughout the book: First, she reminds the reader of the expansiveness, popularity, and reach of <italic>SATC</italic>, which ran from 1998 to 2004 without losing its loyal following. In spite of the fact that the series aired on a subscription cable network, the show maintained its viewership until the February 22, 2004, finale, when 10.5 million tuned in.</p>
<p>Second, Jermyn analyzes the show’s major themes, including consumerism, femininity, feminism, sexuality, and women’s choices. “The fragmented social scene evoked by [creator Candace] Bushnell was unfailingly cruel, superficial, and harsh, and often particularly unforgiving of women,” writes Jermyn, who argues that Bushnell’s “cutting social critique” made possible comparisons between the New York socialite and literary giants such as Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf, and Edith Wharton.</p>
<p><italic>SATC</italic> is based upon Bushnell’s column in the <italic>New York Observer</italic>, her 1996 book by the same title, and her career and personal relationships. “It wasn’t long before Carrie was understood to be Bushnell’s alter ego and Mr. Big as her one-time boyfriend and former publisher of <italic>Vogue</italic>, Ron Galotti,” Jermyn writes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important recurring themes in <italic>Sex and the City</italic> deal with “gendered and sexual identities” as “performative constructs.” These themes help to explain why a television program that features four heterosexual female characters would be so popular with gay men, lesbians, and single women of any sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Third, Jermyn focuses on the films, literature, and television programming that enrich our understanding of <italic>SATC.</italic> For example, Jermyn argues that <italic>SATC</italic> is “deeply indebted” to films by Woody Allen, especially <italic>Annie Hall</italic> (1977) and <italic>Manhattan</italic> (1979). <italic>The Way We Were</italic> (1973), too, influences the television series and is affectionately parodied in one episode: Carrie Bradshaw sees Mr. Big outside the Plaza Hotel before he drives away in a limousine with his new bride. Jermyn also introduces similarities between Carrie Bradshaw and Holly Golightly of <italic>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</italic> (1961).</p>
<p>Literature, too, has an important place in <italic>SATC.</italic> Examples include Theodore Dreiser’s 1900 novel <italic>Sister Carrie—</italic>in which the innocent and naïve Carrie Meeber moves from the Midwest to Chicago and then to New York—and Edith Wharton’s <italic>The House of Mirth</italic> (1905)—in which Lily Bart “cannot reconcile herself to the prospect of a loveless marriage to a wealthy man in order to cement her social position.” “This milieu gave Wharton ample opportunity to dissect such themes as class, privilege, materiality, gender inequity, and the business of marriage, issues that <italic>SATC</italic> would later return to time and again,” Jermyn writes.</p>
<p>Finally, the author alludes to earlier American television shows about women, including <italic>That Girl</italic> (ABC, 1966–71), <italic>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</italic> (CBS, 1970–77), and <italic>Rhoda</italic> (CBS, 1974–78). Valerie Harper, who played Rhoda on <italic>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</italic> and <italic>Rhoda</italic>, makes a cameo appearance in <italic>SATC</italic> as the mother of one of Carrie Bradshaw’s boyfriends. Bradshaw likes his mother more than she likes him, saying that she is “smitten by her zest for life.”</p>
<p>Jermyn conducts a more extensive analysis of <italic>The Golden Girls</italic> (NBC, 1985–92), another television program that celebrates friendship between women in a world where romantic relationships come and go. Although she is certainly not the first to notice the similarities, Jermyn compares the central characters of <italic>SATC</italic> to the older women of <italic>The Golden Girls.</italic> For example, Samantha Jones and Blanche Devereaux, respectively, enjoy the “homosocial world of women,” break the rules that govern “proper feminine propriety,” and embody “conspicuous appetites” for food, happiness, and sex.</p>
<p>Some readers may be alienated by Jermyn’s identification with the characters of <italic>SATC</italic> and her exuberant affection for New York City. However, as the author and coauthor of books about reality television, romantic comedy in contemporary cinema, and crime on television, Jermyn writes incisively about the fast-paced series and does not waver in her belief that <italic>SATC</italic> holds a permanent and significant place in the history of American television.</p>
