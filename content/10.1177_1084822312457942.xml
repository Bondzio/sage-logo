<abstract>
<p>A retrospective review (<italic>n</italic> = 2,247) was conducted from July 1st to October 1st 2010 to determine validity of the Missouri Alliance for Home Care Fall Risk Assessment Tool (MAHC-10). Fall risk was identified by a MAHC-10 score ≥ 4. Two sample <italic>t</italic> test, chi-square, logistic regression, and ROC curve analyses were performed. Fallers (6.35 ± 1.7, <italic>n</italic> = 195) and nonfallers (5.70 ± 1.9, <italic>n</italic> = 2,052) had significantly different (<italic>p</italic> = .011) MAHC-10 scores. The MAHC-10 cutoff score of 4 demonstrated 96.9% sensitivity and 13.3% specificity; however, ROC curve analyses revealed a cutoff score of 6 maximized combined sensitivity and specificity. The MAHC-10 is valid for fall risk screening in the home health setting; however, a cutoff score of 6 may more accurately predict fall risk.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Falls are a major health concern for community-based dwellers above the age of 65. A fall may be defined as “an event that results in a person coming to rest unintentionally on the ground or other level, not as the result of a major intrinsic event or overwhelming hazard.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312457942">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312457942"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312457942">3</xref></sup> Falls are responsible for two thirds of all unintentional injuries leading to death and are the leading cause of preventable injury in older adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822312457942">4</xref></sup> Thirty percent of community dwelling people aged 65 and older fall at least once a year while 15% sustain multiple falls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312457942">5</xref></sup> Since these are community-based home dwellers, these figures are probably lower than actuality because of underreporting. In the United States, falls suffered by people above 65 years of age that required medical attention resulted in more than $19 billion in medical costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312457942">6</xref></sup> The average cost of a fall requiring hospitalization was found to be $26,483 in a recent review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312457942">6</xref></sup> Serious injuries from falls include hip, spine, and other bone fractures as well as traumatic brain injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312457942">7</xref></sup> Other effects include reduced mobility, activity, and physical fitness due to fear of falling, which paradoxically increases the likelihood of another fall, reducing mobility and quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312457942">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because falls are a serious and expensive national health problem, accurate fall risk assessment is a critical component of the evaluation of the home health patient. The OASIS-C Guidance Manual (Item M1910, Responses 1 and 2) states,<disp-quote>
<p>The multi-factor falls risk assessment must include at least one standardized tool that 1) has been scientifically tested in a population with characteristics similar to that of the patient being assessed (for example, community-dwelling elders, non-institutionalized adults with disabilities, etc.) and shown to be effective in identifying people at-risk for falls; and 2) include a standard response scale. The standardized tool must be both appropriate for the patient based on their cognitive and physical status, and appropriately administered as indicated in the instructions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822312457942">9</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For a fall risk assessment tool to meet OASIS-C guidelines, it must meet three criteria. The tool must be</p>
<list id="list1-1084822312457942" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Multifactorial</italic>: The tool needs to include more than one contributing factor to fall risk. This includes but is not limited to balance issues, previous falls, environmental concerns, medications, incontinence, and cognitive deficits.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Standardized</italic>: The tool has to be administered and scored the same way every time it is used and according to the directions of the authors of the tool.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Validated</italic>: The tool and the score it generates have to be confirmed as having a real relationship to fall risk by means of outside testing on the target population. In the case of home health, that would be community dwelling elders. There needs to be research to support the tool findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312457942">10</xref></sup></p></list-item></list>
<p>As of today, the industry has yet to identify a single falls risk assessment tool that satisfies all three criteria. As a result, most agencies have incorporated several tools as an alternative method to meet OASIS-C criteria. A single multifactorial, standardized, and validated tool would provide the clinician with a quick and efficient way to assess fall risk in the home health patient while meeting OASIS-C guidelines. The Missouri Alliance for Home Care Fall Risk Assessment Tool (MAHC-10) has the potential to fill that role.</p>
<p>The MAHC-10 Fall Risk Assessment provides an easy-to-use, evidence-based starting point for home health clinicians to address fall prevention in community dwelling patients. The MAHC-10 is multifactorial. It measures patient fall risk by assessing 10 core elements including age, diagnosis, fall history, incontinence, visual impairment, impaired functional mobility, environmental hazards, polypharmacy, cognitive impairment, and pain. The MAHC-10 is standardized. The MAHC-10 is administered in the same way for each assessment using a standard form. MAHC-10 administrators must be trained in the 10 core elements and how they are assessed. However, the MAHC-10 tool falls short of OASIS-C guidelines because the validity of the tool has not yet been established. Thus the purpose of this research was to determine the validity of the MAHC-10 Fall Risk Assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1084822312457942" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study is a retrospective review of all fall risk assessments collected by nine Missouri home health agencies over a 4-month period per their normal procedure for participation in the MAHC Falls Reduction Benchmarking Study. Inclusion criteria for this retrospective review were all home health patients initially assessed for fall risk from July 1 to October 31, 2010. Falls recorded for these subjects up to 60 days after their initial fall risk assessment (through December 31, 2010 for subjects initially assessed at the end of October) were also reviewed. Hospice patients and mother/pediatric patients were excluded from this review.</p>
<sec id="section3-1084822312457942">
<title>General procedures</title>
<p>As part of the normal procedure for the MAHC Falls Reduction Benchmarking Study, all patients who were admitted to one of the nine Missouri home health agencies participating in the study were administered the MAHC-10 by a trained staff member on admission or readmission. The patient’s response for each of the 10 core elements and a total score for the MAHC-10 were recorded. Patients with a MAHC-10 score ≥4 were considered to be “at-risk” for falls, while patients with a score &lt;4 were considered to be “not at-risk” for falls. Each fall within 60 days of the initial MAHC-10 assessment—including the date of the fall, whether the fall required emergent care, and whether the fall resulted in a hip fracture—was recorded for every patient. Because falls were recorded for each patient for 60 days postadmission, falls data through December 2010 were reviewed and analyzed. For the purposes of this review, any patient who experienced at least one fall within the 60-day period after admission was considered a “faller,” while a subject who did not fall during that 60-day period was classified as a “nonfaller.” If a subject was readmitted during the 4-month review period, only data from his or her first admission and the subsequent 60-day period were included in the analysis.</p>
<p>Each patient was assigned an identification number and all data were recorded by patient number on a standard formatted Excel spreadsheet. On IRB approval of this retrospective review, all fall risk assessment data were de-identified, coded, and entered into a secure database for analysis.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<sec id="section5-1084822312457942">
<title>Descriptive characteristics</title>
<p>Patient age and gender were recorded at time of initial admission. A two-sample <italic>t</italic> test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference in the age of fallers and nonfallers while a chi-square test was used to determine between-group gender differences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1084822312457942">
<title>Construct validity</title>
<p>Construct validity refers to the ability of a test to measure what it is intended to measure. In this study, construct validity of the MAHC-10 was assessed by determining whether raw scores and risk classifications differentiated between fallers and nonfallers. A two-sample <italic>t</italic> test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between MAHC-10 scores of fallers and nonfallers. A chi-square test was used to determine whether a significantly larger proportion of fallers were classified as “at-risk” for falls using the MAHC-10. Significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1084822312457942">
<title>Predictive validity, sensitivity, and specificity</title>
<p>To evaluate the predictive validity of the MAHC-10, a chi-square test was used to determine if a significantly larger proportion of at-risk patients experienced at least one fall within 60 days of admission than not at-risk patients. Predictive validity was further assessed by determining if the 10 core elements of the MAHC-10 were significantly related to fall status. Logistic regression was used to determine whether age, diagnosis, fall history, incontinence, visual impairment, impaired functional mobility, environmental hazards, polypharmacy, and/or pain were significantly related to whether or not an individual was a faller or nonfaller. Significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<p>Sensitivity is defined as a tool’s ability to obtain a true positive result, while specificity refers to a tool’s ability to obtain a true negative result. For this study, a 2 × 2 contingency table was constructed to determine whether the MAHC-10 was a sensitive (classified a subject as “at-risk” who was actually a faller) or specific (classified a subject as “not at-risk” who was actually a nonfaller) tool. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the MAHC-10 for different cutoff scores, a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used. An ROC curve is a graphical representation of sensitivity and specificity for various cutoff scores associated with an assessment tool, in this case, the MAHC-10.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 2,247 subjects met the inclusion criteria during the 4-month admission window. Eight hundred sixty-three (38.4%) subjects were male and 1,385 (61.6%) were female. The average age was 71.9 years (range 18-103, standard deviation 15.2 years). There were 195 fallers (8.7%) and 2,056 nonfallers (91.3%). The average MAHC-10 score for nonfallers was 5.70 (SD 1.95) and for fallers was 6.35 (SD 1.65).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of the MAHC-10 Fall Risk Assessment tool for fall risk screening. The results of this study contribute significantly to the literature regarding this tool and inform users about the tool’s utility for fall risk screening in the home health care setting.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that a score of 4 or greater on the MAHC-10 Fall Risk Assessment tool be used to indicate that someone is “at-risk” for falls. Based on the current study, this cutoff score resulted in a sensitivity of 96.9%, which means that this same percentage of people who fell during the 60 days after admission were accurately identified as being “at-risk” for falls. However, paired with this high sensitivity was a low specificity of only 13.3%. This low specificity resulted in 1,780 of the 2,052 people who did not fall during the 60 days after admission, being identified as having fall risk. While high sensitivity is valued when screening for fall risk, such low specificity may or may not be acceptable to a specific clinic or agency depending on its goals. The disproportionate ratio of sensitivity and specificity associated with this tool may increase the cost, resources, and burden in home health care to provide services to those identified as having fall risk that perhaps do not need fall-related interventions. If an agency has the goal of identifying all fallers, without concern for overidentifying people as having fall risk who actually are not at-risk, specificity may not be a concern. However, if an agency wants to conduct a more thorough fall risk assessment or implement a fall prevention program that requires significant resources, based on the results of this screening tool, low specificity may be undesirable. The goal associated with using the MAHC-10 Fall Risk Assessment tool and the available resources may significantly influence the utility of this tool for a specific clinic or agency.</p>
<p>In fall risk assessment tool research, cutoff scores have been modified to find a balance in sensitivity and specificity of a fall risk assessment tool for specific populations of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822312457942">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822312457942"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084822312457942">13</xref></sup> In an effort to inform those who use the MAHC-10 Fall Risk Assessment tool, resulting sensitivities and specificities for different cutoff scores were reported as part of this study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1084822312457942">Table 3</xref>). As the cutoff score approached 10, the sensitivity decreased and the specificity increased. At higher cutoff scores, more people who fell were not identified as having fall risk; there were more false negatives. However, at these higher cutoff scores, there were also fewer false positives meaning that fewer people were identified as having fall risk when they had not fallen. A cutoff score of 6 maximized combined sensitivity (68.7%) and specificity (46.8%) over any other cutoff score. Again, depending on the purpose for which an agency or organization uses the MAHC-10 Fall Risk Assessment tool, different cutoff scores may achieve different purposes.</p>
<p>The MAHC-10 has construct validity in that it is able to discriminate between fallers and nonfallers, as defined by the study. The difference in the average MAHC-10 scores between the two groups is significant although this difference may not be clinically meaningful. On the MAHC-10 scale, there is 1 point difference between each possible score and the difference in the average scores between the two groups is only 0.65. This difference in average scores between fallers and nonfallers would not be detectable when using the MAHC-10. Interestingly, the MAHC-10 score that falls between the group averages is 6, which is also the score that maximized sensitivity and specificity for the tool using the ROC curves.</p>
<p>The logistic regression analysis revealed that 4 factors contributed significantly to faller status, including a history of falls within the previous 3 months, impaired functional mobility, three or more coexisting diagnoses, and pain affecting the level of function. It has been reported previously that one of the primary risk factors for falls is a history of falls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1084822312457942">14</xref></sup> Impaired functional mobility on the MAHC-10 is defined broadly, including the need for help with activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living, gait or transfer problems, arthritis, pain, fear of falling, foot problems, impaired sensation, impaired coordination, or improper use of assistive devices. Many of these factors are known risk factors for falls and therefore, this finding is consistent with current fall risk literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1084822312457942">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084822312457942">15</xref></sup> Other studies have also indicated that the number of coexisting diagnoses or comorbidities can influence fall risk although in the study by Lee and Stokic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1084822312457942">16</xref></sup> high fall risk was noted only in those with nine or more comorbidities. While pain affecting level of function was also significantly related to faller status, we are concerned that this overlaps with the “impaired functional mobility” item of the MAHC-10, which was defined above. When interpreting logistic regression, it is important that one understands that these 4 factors, if included with 6 other variables than what are included in the MAHC-10, may not again be significantly related to faller status. However, based on this sample of patients, these 4 factors warrant further investigation. From a fall risk perspective, it is important to note that impaired functional mobility, pain, and coexisting diagnoses are potentially modifiable and if treated, may influence a patient’s fall risk although further studies would need to be conducted to confirm this possibility as well.</p>
<p>While this study provides information about the utility of the MAHC-10, the results should be interpreted in light of the study’s limitations. When applying study results to another population, it should be noted that this study included people of ages between 18 and 103. While this large age range might be beneficial for generalizability, no subanalyses were conducted to determine applicability to specific age groups (i.e., 65 years and older) or those that are most often seen in the home health care setting. Additional studies that investigate the use of the MAHC-10 in specific populations or more homogeneous groups of patients may be beneficial for improved external validity. Although this study used prospective methods for classifying fallers and nonfallers, only a 60-day period was used to determine the classification. Many fall risk studies, although most are retrospective, use longer time periods (i.e., 6 months to 1 year) to determine fall status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822312457942">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084822312457942">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822312457942">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1084822312457942"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1084822312457942">19</xref></sup> It is possible that some of those who were classified as nonfallers could have fallen after the 60-day period; these falls would not have been captured. This may help to explain why many nonfallers were identified as having fall risk, which relates to the low specificity. While the prospective design of this study is useful for determining predictive validity of the MAHC-10 tool, additional longitudinal studies that employ longer time frames need to be conducted to be able to more accurately determine the tool’s predictive validity. Other future studies could also include developing a shortened form of the MAHC-10 tool, in particular as it relates to those items that consistently predict faller status versus those that do not seem to be predictive, and studies to determine whether or not the MAHC-10 is sensitive to changes in fall risk status.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the MAHC-10 fall risk assessment tool appears to be a useful fall risk screening tool with good sensitivity at the currently recommended cutoff score of four; however, specificity is poor. When data is aggregated, the tool also demonstrates construct validity. It is important for a clinic or agency to consider how closely their patients match the sample used in this study, to determine generalizability of these results. In addition, because fall risk is multifactorial in nature, it is imperative that clinicians do not use a fall risk screening tool, such as the MAHC-10, as the end point for fall risk assessment, especially when fall risk is identified. When fall risk is identified, a more comprehensive fall risk assessment needs to be conducted to help guide appropriate interventions.</p>
