<abstract>
<p>Continuous compartment pressure monitoring, for acute compartment syndrome, remains an infrequently performed procedure despite the potential benefits some patients may derive from it. This state of affairs may, in part, be attributed to a lack of clinician awareness of an easy and cheap system by which compartment pressures can be monitored. In this article, we describe a simple pressure monitoring set-up that we have successfully employed in a variety of trauma patients, and how we believe the measurements obtained from it can be best interpreted to assist in the diagnosis of compartment syndrome.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1460408611432098" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The role of continuous compartment pressure monitoring in the detection of acute compartment syndrome remains controversial. However, many patients who would potentially benefit from this procedure do not receive it, as clinicians are either unfamiliar with the technique, or perceive it as requiring some arcane skill or highly specialised equipment. While some of these arguments may hold true when investigating chronic compartment syndrome, the same cannot be said for pressure monitoring in acute compartment syndrome, which may be readily performed with a combination of equipment easily found in the ward, theatre and ITU environments.</p>
<p>The most practical account of a simple system for continuous compartment pressure monitoring was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611432098">McQueen (1996)</xref>. While this article addressed the problem commendably, we found that it lacked the detail necessary for the true beginner to get started with compartment pressure monitoring. This article aims to update McQueen’s description, pointing out some of the lessons that we have learnt from monitoring compartment pressures in a variety of trauma patients admitted to the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408611432098"><title>Equipment needed</title>
<p>The equipment and skills needed for continuous compartment pressure monitoring bridge the specialities of surgery and anaesthetics, and the surgeon would do well to have an anaesthetist at hand when trying this technique for the first time. For compartment pressure monitoring, the following equipment is required:
<list id="list1-1460408611432098" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>a pressure catheter (approximately 16 G)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>arterial line pressure monitoring set with transducer</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>a hair clipper, or razor and shaving cream</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Special transducer-tipped catheters represent the current gold standard in pressure monitoring; however, they are expensive and present problems with re-sterilisation. The slit catheter provides a cheap and simple alternative, which has been well validated and is adequate for most purposes. Commercially manufactured slit catheters are available; however, they are still relatively expensive and unlikely to be found on the general surgical or orthopaedic ward. Fortunately, a simple slit catheter can be improvised from nearly any cannula similar to those designed for intravenous use. We use a 16F-gauge 10-cm long intravenous catheter; although epidural catheters and single-ported central lines have also been used to good effect. At a push, a standard length venflon can be used (and we have done this ourselves), however be aware that this is really too short, and when inserted the tip of the catheter will only just lie in the compartment and thus can easily be dislodged. Slits should be made at the tip of the catheter to increase its surface area and reduce the risk obstruction. We find that two slits on either side of the catheter approximately 4 mm in length works well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408611432098">Figure 1</xref>).

<p>An arterial line pressure monitoring set can be found in any ITU or theatre environment. During monitoring, this will need to be connected to a pressure module outputting the signal to a display device of some description. In the ITU, this can be achieved by routing the pressure output onto the monitor screen with all the other measured pressures (the ITU nurse should be able to help you with this). On the ward, except in high-dependency areas, you are unlikely to find a pressure monitoring device and will have to borrow one. If you find yourself monitoring compartment pressures frequently, and cannot afford a monitor of your own, then a decommissioned unit can often be obtained from medical engineering. Although such units may lack all the features required for modern high-dependency unit use, they will be more than adequate for successful compartment pressure monitoring.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1460408611432098"><title>Technique</title>
<p>We will illustrate the technique of pressure monitoring by describing the process for obtaining pressure values from the anterior compartment of the leg. This compartment is the one most commonly affected by compartment syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408611432098">Sheridan and Matsen, 1976</xref>), and when monitoring the lower limb, it is usually adequate to record pressures from the anterior compartment alone, as isolated compartment syndrome of the other compartments is very rare.</p>
<p>Begin by preparing the leg: hair over the anterior compartment should be clipped/shaved to a sufficiently wide area to allow the catheter dressing to be adequately affixed to the skin at the end of the procedure. Clean the skin with an antiseptic agent and drape the site. Inject a few millilitres of lignocaine at your planned point of insertion, and while this taking effect prepare the slit catheter. We find that the easiest way to make the slits is to slightly withdraw the needle within the catheter sheath and push the tip of a size 11 scalpel into the lumen. Some clinicians prefer the technique of leaving the needle in place and cutting down onto it, but we find it harder to control the blade when making incision this way.</p>
<p>Once the local anaesthetic has taken effect, use the scalpel to make small a stab incision in the skin just big enough for the tip of catheter – this will facilitate its entry and prevent the slits folding backwards as the catheter is inserted. Insert the catheter at a 30–40° angle, there will be some resistance as you pass through the compartment fascia, which suddenly gives way as the tip of the catheter enters the anterior compartment. Reduce the insertion angle and push the catheter all the way into the compartment, or until you are happy with the position of the catheter tip.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1460408611432098"><title>Where to site the catheter</title>
<p>In patients with fractures, it is desirable to position the tip of the catheter as close to the fracture site as possible, as this is where the pressure is highest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611432098">Heckman et al., 1994</xref>), but take care to avoid entering the fracture haematoma itself. In patients without fractures, e.g. soft tissue injuries, you should try and site the tip of the catheter approximately in the middle of the compartment. With our 10 cm catheter this means that the point of insertion is typically about 2–3 cm lateral and 5 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity. However, if this site is unsuitable, e.g. due to lack of skin coverage, there is no reason you cannot insert the catheter retrogradely from distal to proximal.</p>
<p>Once the catheter is in place, it can be flushed with couple of millilitres of saline to clear any blockages at the tip; do not instil large volumes of fluid into the compartment as this potentially runs the risk of increasing the intra-compartment pressure (ICP) and inducing a compartment syndrome. When adequately positioned, secure the catheter with a dressing. If you have not yet prepared the arterial line pressure set, this can be done now. You are likely to find a large amount of tubing and three-way taps in the set, nearly all this can be thrown away to leave you with just the transducer with its attached three-way tap, and a short tube connection for attaching to the catheter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1460408611432098">Figure 2</xref>). Fill the transducer with saline and flush the line making sure all air bubbles are removed from the system – air bubbles left in place may lead to a blockage or pressure wave damping. Cap all open ports and connect the system to the catheter, the idea is to create a continuous column of fluid between the compartment and the transducer, along which the pressure wave can be transmitted. At the point of connection, it is common for an air bubble to be created, and we sometimes find it is necessary to flush a few millilitres of saline through the system to push the air bubble into the compartment. Once correctly set-up, it is rarely ever necessary to flush the system, as unlike an arterial line the tip of the pressure catheter lies within muscle, and not blood, so there is nothing to clot. You may find that a helpful ITU nurse attempts to connect to the transducer to a pressurised bag of saline, as would be standard practice for an arterial line. Do not let them do this, as it will flush the line with a few millilitres of fluid every hour, resulting in the infusion of a not insignificant volume of fluid into the compartment over a 24-h period. Position the pressure transducer to lie at the same vertical level as the catheter tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1460408611432098">Figure 3</xref>), and not on the deltoid as is standard practice for arterial pressure monitoring. Again, it is helpful to have removed as much excess tubing from the system as possible to prevent other staff trying to reposition a dislodged transducer on the arm. Ensure the transducer is well secured at the correct level, as raising it above the catheter tip will lead to falsely low readings, while the more likely scenario of having it fall off the leg onto the bed (therefore, being below the catheter tip) will result in falsely high readings. Finally, connect the transducer to a pressure module outputting to a display device and zero the system to atmospheric pressure: turn the three-way tap, so that the connection is off to the leg, but open to the transducer and the unused port; take the cap off the unused port, so that the transducer is open to the air, and zero the system. Once the system is correctly zeroed, replace the cap and move the three-way tap so that it is open to the leg and the transducer, and off to the unused port. If everything has been done correctly, you should see a pressure value (and a pressure wave, if your monitor is set-up to display that) on the screen. You can confirm that the system is working by gently squeezing the anterior compartment over the catheter tip, and observing a rise in pressure which returns back to baseline when the pressure is released.

<sec id="sec5-1460408611432098"><title>Dealing with problems</title>
<p>When monitoring the anterior compartment of the leg, normal pressure values should lie between approximately 5–14 mmHg; however, in the injured leg, they are typically higher, often around 20–28 mmHg. Negative pressures are obviously impossible and indicate some problem with system, usually an air bubble within the tubing, creating an airlock, or a blockage at the catheter tip. When trouble shooting this problem, begin by checking for air bubbles: disconnect the transducer system from the catheter and flush thoroughly before reconnecting and re-zeroing. If this does not fix the problem, check for a blockage at the catheter tip: try flushing the catheter with 1 mL of saline (but do not do this repeatedly as the volume of fluid flushed into the compartment will add up), or withdraw the catheter, and recheck. In cases where these measures fail to solve the problem, it may be necessary to replace the catheter completely, however, in our experience, this is rarely required.</p>
<p>Falsely high pressures can result from external pressure to the system, this most commonly occurs where the cap on the open limb of the three-way tap has been screwed on very tightly, this can be fixed by simply unscrewing the cap and re-zeroing the system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1460408611432098"><title>Monitoring other compartments</title>
<p>The deep posterior compartment of the leg can be approached in a retrograde fashion inserting the catheter immediately behind the posterior border of the tibial, approximately 5 cm proximal to the medial malleolus. It can then be ‘walked’ off the back of the tibia until it is felt to penetrate the fascial sheath of the compartment. The lateral and superficial compartments of the leg, and most compartments of the arm, hand and foot can be approach directly using a similar technique to that described above. Interosseous compartments in the hand or foot can be approached directly or through the web spaces.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1460408611432098"><title>Interpretation of pressure values</title>
<p>At present, only the pressures in the compartments of the adult leg have been described in any detail in the literature. Interpreting pressure values in other compartments and in children follow similar principles to those described below, but the absolute values may vary. Many attempts have been made to define the need for fasciotomy based on absolute compartment pressures. Pressure thresholds ranging from 30 to 50 mmHg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611432098">Matsen et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611432098">Mubarak et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611432098">Rorabeck, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611432098">Allen et al., 1985</xref>) have been proposed, but all have generally suffered from problems of over or under-treatment. Following the recognition that individual susceptibility to compartment syndrome is related in many patients to systemic blood pressure, the use of perfusion pressures (Δ<italic>P</italic>) have been advocated as a more specific tool for diagnosing compartment syndrome, where
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1460408611432098"><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-1460408611432098" xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611432098-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408611432098">McQueen and Court-Brown (1996)</xref> presented evidence for a Δ<italic>P</italic> threshold of &lt;30 mmHg as predictive of compartment syndrome. Although this study advocated this threshold only in normotensive patients with tibial fractures, this has not prevented other researchers attempting to apply it to other patient groups. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611432098">Kosir et al. (2007)</xref> examined the same threshold in a variety of major trauma patients requiring intensive care support. They found that 20% of patients reached the threshold for fasciotomy within the first 24 h of admission, all of whom were operated on. While the authors argued that all patients reaching the Δ<italic>P</italic> threshold showed signs of compartment syndrome at fasciotomy, this frequency of compartment syndrome is probably not consistent with most UK clinicians experience, or the epidemiological data on compartment syndrome.</p>
<p>It is our experience that the monitoring of compartment/perfusion pressures forms part of diagnostic tool-set for identifying compartment syndrome and should not be interpreted in isolation. Single measurements should not be relied upon, as we have frequently seen patients with very high ICPs/low Δ<italic>P</italic> that settled after 2–3 h. Similarly, we have seen patients who have dropped their Δ<italic>P</italic> below 30 mmHg, at relatively low ICPs (due to very low diastolic blood pressures), but who demonstrated no clinical features of compartment syndrome at the time, or obvious sequelae on follow-up.</p>
<p>We find it most useful to interpret the trends in ICP and Δ<italic>P</italic> over a number of hours, and it is here that continuous pressure monitoring has significant advantages over one-off measurements. A rise in ICP with no associated change in Δ<italic>P</italic> can probably be safely observed for a few hours, as long as the patient demonstrates no clinical features of compartment syndrome. Conversely, a progressive rise in ICP, accompanied by a fall in ΔP, is highly suggestive of impending compartment syndrome. In general, we have found that an elevation in ICP &gt; 30 mmHg, coupled with a Δ<italic>P</italic> &lt; 30 mmHg, for two or more hours, a useful identifier of those patients requiring further clinical assessment for compartment syndrome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1460408611432098" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>While the role of continuous compartment pressure monitoring as a routine procedure in unselected trauma patients remains debated, we believe it has significant utility in high risk or difficult to monitor patients, e.g. the ITU patient or those with peripheral nerve blocks. Unfortunately, many trauma patients who might benefit from pressure monitoring do not receive it, due to a lack of awareness amongst clinicians of an easy and cheap system for doing so. We hope that the simple set-up described here will make the process of compartment pressure monitoring more accessible to clinicians, and ultimately bring the procedure to more patients who may derive benefit from it.</p>
