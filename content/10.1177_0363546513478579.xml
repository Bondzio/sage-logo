<sec id="section1-0363546513478579">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Trochlear dysplasia is an important etiological factor for the development of patellofemoral instability. Because a dislocation of the patella as a result of trochlear dysplasia results in a traumatic disruption of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), a combined trochleoplasty and patellofemoral ligament reconstruction appears to be the most appropriate procedure to treat patients with severe trochlear dysplasia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513478579">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Combined trochleoplasty and anatomic reconstruction of the MPFL will prevent redislocations of the patella and will lead to improved knee function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513478579">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513478579">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Twenty-three consecutive patients (26 knees) with patellofemoral instability and severe trochlear dysplasia underwent combined trochleoplasty and anatomic reconstruction of the MPFL. Preoperative radiographic examination included anteroposterior and lateral views to assess patella alta. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate trochlear dysplasia and the tibial tubercle–trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance. Evaluations included the detection of cartilage injuries, preoperative and postoperative physical examinations, and scores for the visual analog scale (VAS), Kujala knee function, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), activity rating scale (ARS), and Tegner activity scale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513478579">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The mean age at the time of operation was 19.2 years (range, 15.4-23.6 years). The mean follow-up after operation was 2.5 years after surgery (range, 2.0-3.5 years). No recurrent dislocation occurred postoperatively. Kujala scores improved from 79 to 96, IKDC scores from 74 to 90, and VAS scores from 3 to 1. All improvements were highly statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). The activity level according to the Tegner activity scale and the ARS decreased but was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .06 and <italic>P</italic> = .21, respectively). There were 95.7% of the patients who were satisfied or very satisfied with the procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513478579">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Combined anatomic reconstruction of the MPFL and trochleoplasty reliably improved the stability of the patellofemoral joint in patients with severe trochlear dysplasia and no or mild degenerative changes. In addition, the described procedure showed significant improvement of knee function and good patient satisfaction without any episode of redislocations of the patella.</p>

<p>Acute patellar dislocations tend to affect teenagers and young adults and may be followed by recurrent dislocations. Recurrence rates of up to 60% have been reported in the literature; this underlines the high risk in young active patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513478579">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513478579">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513478579">17</xref></sup> Trochlear dysplasia is known to be a major risk factor for patellofemoral instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513478579">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513478579">13</xref></sup> Dejour et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513478579">13</xref></sup> found that 96% of patients with a history of a true patellar dislocation had evidence of trochlear dysplasia.

However, raising the lateral condyle can increase patellofemoral contact pressures and therefore induce arthritis. Van Knoch et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513478579">37</xref></sup> have reported favorable results after trochleoplasty using the Bereiter technique in which an osteochondral flap is molded into the deepened trochlea. However, performing a trochleoplasty as a single procedure to stabilize the patella might not be sufficient, as recurrent patellar dislocations cause a traumatic disruption of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), a part of the medial parapatellar structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513478579">25</xref></sup> Because the stabilizing role of the MPFL as the main restraining force to lateral displacement of the patella has been emphasized,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513478579">3</xref></sup> reconstruction of the MPFL has become increasingly important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513478579">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513478579">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513478579">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513478579">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513478579">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513478579">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513478579">33</xref></sup> Therefore, in patients with severe trochlear dysplasia, MPFL reconstruction as a single procedure is not thought to be the appropriate procedure, as it does not address the bony abnormality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513478579">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513478579">31</xref></sup> A combined correction of the femoral trochlea and reconstruction of the MPFL appears to be more reasonable in this patient group.

<title>Patients</title>
<p>This study was approved by the ethics committee of the institution. Between 2007 and 2010, 93 patients underwent a reconstruction of the MPFL because of recurrent patellar dislocations. In 28 patients (31 knees) with severe trochlear dysplasia, combined trochleoplasties and reconstructions of the MPFL were performed.</p>
<p>All operative procedures were performed by the author (M.N.) using the trochleoplasty technique described by Von Knoch et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513478579">37</xref></sup> Anatomic reconstruction of the MPFL was performed with a double-bundle technique utilizing a free gracilis tendon graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513478579">24</xref></sup> Inclusion criteria were patients with severe trochlear dysplasia who had experienced at least 2 recurrent dislocations of the patella despite a nonoperative treatment program. Patients with a tibial tubercle–trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance &gt;2.2 cm were excluded, as in these 3 patients, an additional medialization of the tibial tubercle was performed. In 1 patient with a valgus deformity of the knee, an additional varization osteotomy was performed. This patient was also excluded from the study. Further contraindications included International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade III or IV degenerative changes of the femoral trochlear cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513478579">7</xref></sup> One patient was lost to follow-up. This resulted in a cohort of 23 patients (26 knees), in whom 9 (10 knees) were female and 14 were male (16 knees). Only patients with a minimum follow-up of 24 months were included in this study.</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>Arthroscopic examination included visualization from a superolateral portal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513478579">Figure 1</xref>). The degree of chondromalacia was assessed according to the ICRS grading system. Only patients with a convex chondral surface of the proximal trochlea were considered candidates for trochleoplasty.</p>

</fig>
<p>After the diagnostic arthroscopic procedure, an oblique incision was made along the pes anserinus. After the fascia was exposed, the gracilis tendon was harvested proximally using a tendon stripper. Distally, the tendon was sharply detached from the tibia. The tendon was prepared with a nonabsorbable whipstitch suture (Sulene USP 2, Serag-Wiessner, Naila, Germany) on both ends.</p>
<p>The femoral trochlea was exposed through a lateral parapatellar arthrotomy with retraction of the patella medially to facilitate exposure of the femoral trochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513478579">Figure 2A</xref>). The articular cartilage was separated from the synovium. According to the technique described by Von Knoch et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513478579">37</xref></sup> an osteochondral flake was raised from the trochlea, extending to the intercondylar notch using different curved osteotomies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513478579">Figure 2B</xref>). The subchondral groove was then deepened using chisels and a high-speed bur. Because the trochlea typically is medialized in patients with trochlear dysplasia, the aim was to create a recentralized groove. The osteochondral flake was then pressed into the newly formed groove and fixed with 2 transosseous 3-mm Vicryl bands (Ethicon Products, Norderstedt, Germany) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513478579">Figure 2C</xref>). The synovium was reattached to the margins of the articular cartilage with an absorbable 2-0 Vicryl suture, and closure of the lateral retinaculum with Vicryl 1 was performed.</p>

</fig>
<p>The medial-proximal two-thirds of the patella were then exposed over the same skin incision. The medial border of the patella was exposed subperiosteally over a length of 2.5 cm, avoiding injury of the joint capsule. Two converging V-shaped tunnels with a diameter of 4 mm were drilled to the depth of about 1.5 cm at the superomedial half of the patella with sufficient distance between tunnels to avoid fracturing. The gracilis tendon graft was then inserted into the tunnel, forming a loop through the patella.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513478579">23</xref></sup> By blunt dissection, the interval between the capsule and the vastus medialis obliquus was developed to the femoral insertion of the MPFL. With use of the indirect radiographic method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513478579">29</xref></sup> the anatomic femoral insertion of the MPFL was identified under fluoroscopic control. A guide pin (size, 2.4 mm) was placed at the femoral insertion. Fluoroscopy was used to confirm the correct placement of the guide pin. After verification of the entry point, the guide pin was drilled to the lateral condyle. Then, a medial blind tunnel (diameter, 6 mm) was drilled along the guide pin to accommodate a double thickness of the graft to an adequate depth (4 cm) to allow optimal graft tensioning. The graft was then pulled between the second and third layers to the femoral insertion point. A locking suture was passed through the transepicondylar axis, pulling the graft into the medial tunnel. The knee was cycled several times from full flexion to full extension with the graft under tension. Excessive tightening of the graft was avoided. The graft was then secured within the medial condyle tunnel using a bioresorbable interference screw with the knee flexed to 30°. Finally, closure of subcutaneous tissues and skin was performed. Routine dressings and bandages were applied.</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546513478579">
<title>Rehabilitation</title>
<p>Postoperatively, partial weightbearing, using crutches, was allowed. Daily physical therapy with active and passive flexion and extension exercises of the knee, strengthening of the vastus medialis muscle, and straight-leg raising exercises were recommended. Full weightbearing was allowed at 6 weeks and return to sport at the third postoperative month. Strenuous sports with high-risk pivoting activities (eg, soccer, basketball) were not recommended, as it is believed that they increase the risk of patellofemoral arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513478579">9</xref></sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546513478579">
<title>Evaluation Methods</title>
<p>Preoperative radiographic examination of the knee included anteroposterior (standing, weightbearing) and lateral radiographic views to assess patella alta and signs of malalignment and to exclude further skeletal abnormalities. Patellar height was measured on lateral radiographs utilizing the method described by Insall and Salvati.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513478579">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In all patients, trochlear dysplasia and the TT-TG distance were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513478579">30</xref></sup> To assess trochlear dysplasia, axial MRI (fat-saturated proton density–weighted fast spin echo imaging sequence; 1.5-T VA17A Symphony, A Tim System, Siemens, Munich, Germany) of the most proximal craniocaudal axial MRI scan on which the cartilage along the entire width of the trochlea was visible was performed. Only patients with severe trochlear dysplasia were included in the study, as mild trochlear dysplasia is not an indication for performing a trochleoplasty. Severe trochlear dysplasia was defined as the presence of a dome-shaped chondral surface of the proximal trochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513478579">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513478579">2A</xref>). Measurement of the TT-TG distance was performed on superimposed axial slices.</p>
<p>Preoperative and postoperative knee evaluations included clinical examination, assessment of symptoms, crepitus, range of motion, patellofemoral pain, and patellar apprehension. Because there is currently no ideal scoring system for patellofemoral instability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513478579">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513478579">26</xref></sup> a combination of the following scores as recommended in the literature was used.</p>
<p>Knee function was assessed with the Kujala knee function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513478579">21</xref></sup> International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513478579">20</xref></sup> activity rating scale (ARS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513478579">22</xref></sup> Tegner activity scale,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513478579">34</xref></sup> and visual analog scale for pain (VAS) scores. Patient satisfaction with the procedure was also recorded. The final clinical outcome was rated as very satisfied (knee function very much exceeded preoperative status), satisfied (knee function improved with no subluxation), partially satisfied (knee function improved but still apprehensive), and not satisfied (knee function same as preoperative status with one or more episodes of patellar subluxation). Additionally, we assessed whether patients had returned to their preoperative preferred sports and, if so, whether they had returned to their sport at the same, lower, or higher level at the time of follow-up. Strenuous activities such as heavy physical work were also recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0363546513478579">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Continuous variables were summarized as median, minimum, and maximum. Nominal and ordinal variables were analyzed using frequencies. The differences between preoperative and postoperative Kujala, IKDC, VAS, Tegner activity, and ARS scores were compared using the generalized estimation equation (GEE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513478579">39</xref></sup> Generalized estimation equation was used because of statistical dependencies in 3 patients who contributed both knees. Statistical analysis was carried out using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Because of the explorative nature of this study, no adjustment for multiple testing was made. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered as significant. The results of all statistical tests are interpreted in an exploratory sense.</p>

<p>The mean age of the patients at the time of operation was 19.2 years (range, 15.4-23.6 years). The mean follow-up after surgery was 2.5 years (range, 2.0-3.5 years). No recurrent dislocation has occurred postoperatively. Thirteen patients had undergone a previous surgery before the index surgery. In 6 patients, a combined medial reefing and lateral release was carried out. In 4 patients, medial reefing alone was performed, and in 1 patient, medial reefing was supplemented by advancement of the vastus medialis muscle. In 2 patients, a Roux-Goldthwait procedure and an additional medial reefing were performed.</p>
<p>Preoperative anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the knees as well as MRI scans were available for all patients. The median patellar height ratio (Insall-Salvati index) was 1.2 (range, 1.05-1.35).

<p>Preoperative physical examination showed a positive apprehension sign in all patients. The J sign was positive in 19 of 23 patients (22/26 knees). All patients exhibited a free range of motion preoperatively. At arthroscopic surgery, chondral lesions of the retropatellar cartilage of ICRS grade I were observed in 15 knees, grade II in 3 knees, and grade IV in 2 knees. In 6 knees, no degenerative changes were detected. Chondral lesions of the trochlear cartilage of ICRS grade I were observed in 6 knees and grade II in 1 knee. In 18 patients, no degenerative changes were detected. Two patients required microfracturing because of the retropatellar cartilage of full-thickness ICRS grade IV.</p>

<title>Clinical Outcome</title>
<p>There have been no recurrent dislocations. Ten patients were rated as “very satisfied” with the surgical procedure, 12 patients were “satisfied,” and 1 was “partially satisfied.” No patient was dissatisfied with the procedure. Six patients performed heavy physical work such as a floor layer, lacquer painter, or carpenter.</p>
<p>At follow-up, all knees regained full extension and flexion. None of the patients showed presence of a positive J sign. Patellofemoral crepitus was present in 3 of 26 knees but was not associated with pain. One patient was still apprehensive, but no redislocation had occurred. On clinical examination, she exhibited increased mediolateral mobility of the patella, and the gracilis tendon graft was loose but intact during palpation. Because she did not complain of pain or instability, no further treatment was recommended.</p>
<p>One patient returned to sports at a higher level than preoperatively. Sixteen patients returned to sports at the preoperative level, while only 6 participated in sports at a lower level than preoperatively.</p>
<p>The reason given for participation at a lower level than preoperatively was fear of reinjury, and while they were advised to be physically active, strenuous sports such as soccer were not recommended. The median Kujala score improved significantly from 79 (range, 21-100) preoperatively to 96 (range, 74-100) at follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). The median IKDC score improved significantly from 74 (range, 32-95) preoperatively to 90 (range, 65-98) at follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), with only 2 patients showing a decreased IKDC score postoperatively. The patients were additionally asked to compare their knee function preoperatively and postoperatively on a scale from 0 (cannot perform daily activities) to 10 (no limitation in daily activities). The median knee function improved significantly from 5 (range, 3-9) preoperatively to 8 (range, 6-10) at follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). The median VAS score illustrated significant preoperative to postoperative improvement from 3 (range, 1-7) to 1 (range, 0-5) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>The activity level according to the Tegner activity scale decreased from 5.5 (range, 2-8) preoperatively to 5.0 postoperatively (range, 2-8), which was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .06) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513478579">Table 2</xref>). The median ARS score decreased from 6.5 (range, 0-16) preoperatively to 6 (range, 0-12) at follow-up, which was also not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .21) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513478579">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present prospective study, combined trochleoplasty and anatomic reconstruction of the MPFL showed significant improvement of knee function and good patient satisfaction in young patients with severe trochlear dysplasia. No redislocations occurred. The complication rate was low. The significant increase in IKDC and Kujala scores and the decrease in VAS levels demonstrate the ability of the combined trochleoplasty and anatomic reconstruction of the MPFL to improve function and relieve clinical symptoms in patients with patellofemoral instability.</p>
<p>In 1 patient, arthroscopic surgery of the knee had to be performed because of a meniscal tear 26 months postoperatively after trochleoplasty. The arthroscopic picture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513478579">Figure 3A</xref>) of the femoral trochlea of this patient illustrates the newly created groove with only mild superficial cartilage lesions. The corresponding MRI scan in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513478579">Figure 3B</xref> shows the subchondral scar after trochleoplasty and intact trochlear cartilage.</p>

<p>Whereas there are numerous publications reporting results after anatomic reconstruction of the MPFL or after trochleoplasty, to our knowledge, this is the first prospective study reporting the results of combined anatomic reconstruction of the MPFL and trochleoplasty in this challenging group of patients with severe trochlear dysplasia.</p>
<p>The results show that most patients were able to perform sports postoperatively at the preoperative level; however, only 1 patient returned to sports at a higher level than preoperatively. Only 1 of the patients in the present study described himself as a competitive athlete, although 10 patients felt they were able to perform very strenuous activities like jumping or pivoting as in basketball or soccer. Most patients in the present study only engaged in low-demand sporting activities preoperatively and postoperatively. Reasons for the patients not to return to sports at a higher level were fear of reinjury and that they were advised to be physically active, although strenuous sports such as soccer were not recommended. Interestingly, 6 male patients were heavy workers. They reported no problems during their heavy physical work as a floor layer, lacquer painter, or carpenter.</p>
<p>In our patient cohort, the physical activity as measured with the Tegner activity scale and the ARS did not decrease statistically significantly from preoperatively to postoperatively. These results indicate that patients did not increase their activity postoperatively, although function scores and pain levels improved, and 95.7% of the patients were satisfied or very satisfied with their knee function. Most patients were concerned about the risk of redislocations during vigorous sports and therefore personally chose to limit their activities. Similar results were found in a previous study investigating sports activity after reconstruction of the MPFL in adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513478579">24</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The <italic>P</italic> value of the change in the Tegner activity score from preoperatively to postoperatively almost reached statistical significance. Therefore, with a higher number of patients, the change in the Tegner score supposedly could have reached statistical significance.</p>
<p>Reconstruction of the MPFL as a single procedure has shown good results in patients with no or mild trochlear dysplasia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513478579">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513478579">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513478579">18</xref></sup> However, in the presence of severe trochlear dysplasia with a dome-shaped trochlea, reconstruction of the MPFL without concomitant trochleoplasty is prone to failure because excessive laterally directed forces beyond those normally supported by a native MPFL exist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513478579">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513478579">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513478579">31</xref></sup> Additionally, abnormal joint loading has to be expected when only performing a MPFL reconstruction in cases of severe trochlear dysplasia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513478579">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>There have been no studies that evaluated the results of reconstruction of the MPFL with the same inclusion criteria as in our study. However, different studies assessed the results of MPFL reconstruction, considering the presence of trochlear dysplasia. In a recent study about reconstruction of the MPFL in adolescents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513478579">24</xref></sup> 2 patients with high-grade trochlear dysplasia had a positive apprehension sign and a positive J sign at follow-up and were only partially satisfied with the operation. In the study of Howells et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513478579">18</xref></sup> 15 of 25 patients with persistent recurrent symptoms after reconstruction of the MPFL had moderate trochlear dysplasia. The authors had already excluded patients with severe trochlear dysplasia. The authors stated that in patients with severe trochlear dysplasia, MPFL reconstruction as a single procedure is not the appropriate procedure.</p>
<p>Another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513478579">38</xref></sup> investigated the influence of risk factors on clinical outcome after reconstruction of the MPFL and found a negative relationship between the degree of trochlear dysplasia and clinical outcome. In a recent meta-analysis by Shah et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513478579">31</xref></sup> a complication rate of 26.1% was found after reconstruction of the MPFL. One of the major complications that the authors found was postoperative instability with recurrent apprehension (32% of all complications). The authors stated that the rate of recurrent apprehension and subluxation may be caused by other unrecognized and uncorrected risk factors for patellofemoral instability, such as higher grade trochlear dysplasia. For this reason, the consequential solution in the patient with patellofemoral instability secondary to trochlear dysplasia is the correction of both underlying abnormalities (creation of a new groove in the trochlea in conjunction with MPFL reconstruction).</p>
<p>In reviewing the literature, the indications for trochleoplasty have not been strict. Diverse indications for trochleoplasty have been advocated by several authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513478579">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513478579">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513478579">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513478579">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513478579">37</xref></sup>; therefore, the results in these studies are difficult to compare. In none of these scientific reviews was a combined reconstruction of the MPFL and trochleoplasty performed.</p>
<p>Von Knoch et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513478579">37</xref></sup> have published a 4- to 14-year follow-up study after trochleoplasty. Postoperatively, all but 2 knees had correction of trochlear dysplasia radiologically, but degenerative changes of the patellofemoral joint developed in 30% of the knees. Patellofemoral pain became worse in 33.4% and improved in 49%.</p>
<p>Utting et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513478579">35</xref></sup> found an improvement of all outcome scores in a series of 40 patients with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. There were 92.6% of their patients who were satisfied with the outcome of their procedure. However, a total of 27 supplementary procedures were required, but only in 4 patients was an additional MPFL reconstruction performed. Of their 16 patients with residual symptoms, 8 had painful instability.</p>
<p>Schöttle et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513478579">28</xref></sup> reported results after trochleoplasty of 19 knees in 16 patients at a mean follow-up of 3 years. No redislocations occurred, but 4 patients still were apprehensive and anxious when an examiner attempted to lateralize the patella.</p>
<p>Donell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513478579">14</xref></sup> reported on 17 knees in 15 patients who had a modified Dejour trochleoplasty with a mean follow-up of 3 years. In all patients, a supplementary lateral release was performed. In 16 patients, a medial retinacular reefing was done. A tibial tubercle medialization was performed in 7, and in 2, a distalization of the tibial tubercle was also carried out. Seven knees demonstrated a mild residual apprehension test finding. Thirteen patients were satisfied or very satisfied, but a further 18 operative procedures were needed.</p>
<p>A possible reason for the residual apprehensiveness reported in the aforementioned studies might be the fact that in none of the studies was a supplementary reconstruction of the MPFL performed routinely. In the present study, only 1 patient with an insufficiency of the MPFL was apprehensive. Our experience is that a supplementary reconstruction of the MPFL seems to increase the stability of the patella and improves the functional outcome. When patients were asked what was most different postoperatively to preoperatively, the most frequent answer was that the knee was more stable than preoperatively.</p>
<p>There are 2 further possible reasons for the better results of the present study compared with results reported in the literature. This review had patients with a lower average age of 19.2 years, and only patients with no or mild degenerative changes of the femoral trochlea underwent trochleoplasty. In the study of Utting et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513478579">35</xref></sup> all patients with ongoing pain had abnormalities of either the trochlear or patellar cartilage before the trochleoplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513478579">35</xref></sup> Therefore, we recommend that the proposed procedure of trochleoplasty supplemented by reconstruction of the MPFL should be reserved for young patients with no or minimal degenerative changes of the femoral trochlea.</p>
<p>Major strengths of this study are that all operations were performed by a single surgeon and that a standardized operation without additional procedures was evaluated. Major limitations of this study are the lack of a randomized control group and that only a small cohort of patients was evaluated. Another limitation is that no a priori power analysis was performed. Although the combined procedure was found to be successful at an average follow-up of 2.5 years, the long-term outcome has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>In conclusion, combined trochleoplasty and reconstruction of the MPFL was found to be very successful in patients with severe trochlear dysplasia, resulting in consistent statistically significant improvement in all applied knee function scoring systems. According to the literature, compared with a trochleoplasty as a single procedure, the described combined procedure reliably improves the stability of the patellofemoral joint.</p>
