<p>Due to improved tissue regeneration and the enabling of post-operative minimally invasive interventions in the same vessel segment, biodegradable polymeric scaffolds represent a competitive approach to permanent metallic stents in vascular applications. Despite these advantages some challenges, such as the improvement of the scaffold mechanics and enhancement of scaffold visibility during the implantation procedure, are persisting. Therefore, the scope of our studies was to investigate the potential of gold, silver and magnetite nanoparticles incorporated in a polymeric blend of poly(L-lactide)/poly(4-hydroxybutyrate) for image enhancement in X-ray, magnetic resonance or near-infrared imaging. Their impact on mechanical properties of such modified scaffold materials was also evaluated.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328212443393" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>To overcome vascular occlusions stents were often successfully administrated via balloon angioplasty. Despite their capability of mechanically preventing localized blood flow constriction, conventional bare metal stents (BMS) are associated with in-stent restenosis in about 15–20% of the patients who then require re-intervention within 6–12 months after BMS implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328212443393">1</xref></sup> Another established clinical approach is the implantation of drug-eluting stents (DES). Although DES have impressively demonstrated their capability of reducing in-stent restenosis, some safety issues and potential risks remain, such as delayed healing, late thrombosis and hypersensitivity demanding further development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328212443393">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328212443393"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212443393">4</xref></sup> Therefore, advancements in stent technology address the development of bioabsorbable stent platforms and drug carriers as well as novel drugs with a differential effect on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, providing efficient inhibition of muscle cells without altering the endothelial cell function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328212443393">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328212443393"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328212443393"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328212443393">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Stents based on biodegradable polymers, now commonly referred to as absorbable scaffolds, which will absorb under physiological conditions were developed to prevent adverse late thrombosis events and allow for restoration of vasomotion and long-term positive remodeling of the stented/scaffolded vessel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328212443393">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328212443393"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328212443393">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, the absorption of polymeric scaffolds can be advantageous for paediatric patients, as vascular reconstruction in this patient group requires an approach substantially different from that used in the adult population. One important factor, to be considered within this patient population is the inevitability of growth. The resulting necessity of implant replacement could be avoided with biodegradable implants bearing the potential for tissue regeneration and growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328212443393">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328212443393">13</xref></sup> Despite all the advances of polymer technology in stent development, the reality of polymeric scaffolds deals with a number of issues that have to be looked at separately.</p>
<p>Thus, it is of great clinical importance to monitor absorbable polymer-based vascular scaffolds on the way to and around the targeted pathological sites by using various imaging modalities. The location and course of these implanted devices assure their proper function and avoid complications that malposition can cause. Unfortunately, polymeric scaffolds are hardly visible with common imaging methods. Another drawback of polymeric scaffolds compared to their metallic counterparts is that they are significantly bulkier to achieve the same radial strength.</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations nanoparticles incorporated in the polymer scaffold matrix may proffer a new way. Bridging the gap between the atomic state and bulk phases of materials, nanoscale materials provide novel physical and chemical properties. For instance, spherical gold nanoparticles appear ruby red in solution, magnetic nanoparticles are used as MRI contrast agents, quantum dots as fluorescent markers and gold nanorods and wires as NIR markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328212443393">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328212443393"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328212443393">16</xref></sup> In addition to the imaging contrast function, nanoparticles can also be used as reinforcement elements to improve mechanical properties of the polymer-based scaffold materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328212443393">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The advances in chemical synthesis methods have enabled the production of nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes with very narrow size distributions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328212443393">18</xref></sup> Thus, the high level of control over the architecture of nanoparticles, their size, shape, density, and their surface functionality, make them ideal as nano-sized filler particles with properties that can be tailored to the vascular scaffold application. Therefore, in this article we report on the comparison of the visual enhancement properties of gold, silver and magnetite nanoparticle doped biodegradable polymeric scaffold materials with consideration to the impact of the embedded nanoparticles on the demanded scaffold mechanics.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328212443393"><title>Synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles</title>
<p>The synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles, dispersible in organic solvents, was carried out according to Green.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328212443393">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328212443393">20</xref></sup> Briefly, a mixture of 25 g TOPO, 10 g ODA and 32.5 mg NaBH<sub>4</sub> was heated to 190℃. In case of gold nanoparticles, 70 mg HAuCl<sub>4 </sub>x H<sub>2</sub>O (approx. 50% Au basis) were dissolved in 7 ml 4-tert-butylpyridine and afterwards injected into the 190℃ hot reaction mixture. In case of silver nanoparticles, 34 mg AgNO<sub>3</sub> were dissolved in 7 mL 4-tert-butylpyridine. The heating source was removed after 30 min and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to 60℃. Then the nanoparticles were precipitated with methanol. The residue was re-dispersed in 100 mL chloroform. The precipitation and re-dispersion step were repeated 3 times to remove excess capping agent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0885328212443393"><title>Synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles</title>
<p>The synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles was carried out by using the facile and convenient co-precipitation technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328212443393">21</xref></sup> About 12 g FeCl<sub>3</sub> and 14.6 g FeCl<sub>2 </sub>x 4 H<sub>2</sub>O were dissolved in 50 mL water. 40 mL ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH, 26%) and 6 g oleic acid were added, whereby precipitation of magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) occurred. The reaction mixture was heated to 70℃ under stirring for 30 min, afterwards to 110℃ to evaporate water and NH<sub>3</sub>, until a black and grease residue remained. The residue was washed with water several times and then dried in a heating chamber overnight.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328212443393"><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title>
<p>To determine their size distribution and shape the nanoparticles were mounted on carbon-coated metal stubs. The resulting samples were examined in a XL30 (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) scanning electron microscope (SEM).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328212443393"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title>
<p>Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) of synthesised nanoparticles and nanoparticles containing minitubes were obtained with in a Jeol JEM-1400 TEM instrument (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) operating at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. In case of synthesised nanoparticles, a drop of the nanoparticle solution (1 µg/mL) was placed on a membrane coated TEM copper grid surface and allowed to settle down for one minute. The grid was rotated at 5000 rpm for several seconds using a spin coater (KL-SCE-20, LOT-Oriel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Darmstadt, Germany). The grid surface was air dried at room temperature before loaded into the microscope. Samples of nanoparticle containing minitubes were embedded in Araldit® resin at 60℃. Ultrathin sections for TEM were prepared using a microtome Ultracut S Leica (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with 45° diamond knives, collected on copper grids.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328212443393"><title>UV-visible spectrophotometer</title>
<p>Absorption spectra of the used nanoparticle solutions in the range of 200–1000 nm were measured using a UV-visible spectrometer (Ultrospec 2000, Pharmacia Biotech) and a 1 cm quartz cuvette.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328212443393"><title>Minitube manufacture</title>
<p>In a first step, nanoparticle containing polymer solution in chloroform was prepared to fabricate polymeric minitubes (as preliminary stage of the developed polymeric scaffolds) with an inner diameter of 1.4 mm by dip-coating of stainless steel mandrels. Therefore the polymers PLLA and P(4HB) supplemented with TEC were dissolved in chloroform (PLLA/P(4HB)/TEC 70/20/10%, w/w/w) according to Grabow et al. (2007) to yield a total polymer concentration of 1.6% (w/v).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328212443393">22</xref></sup> The dip-coating procedure was performed in a repetitive, automated dipping process until a nominal wall thickness of 150 µm of the polymer tubes was achieved. The wall thickness was determined by measuring the diameter difference between the coated and uncoated sections of stainless steel mandrels using a 2-axis laser scanner (ODAC 32XY, Zumbach, Switzerland). The polymer tubes were then removed from the mandrels and washed in methanol and water for 24 h, respectively, to remove TEC and chloroform residues. Finally, all washed and vacuum-dried (25 mbar, 40℃, 24 h) tubes with a final polymer blend combination of PLLA/P(4HB) of 77.8/22.2% (w/w) were cut to a length of 25 mm.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0885328212443393"><title>Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry</title>
<p>For the measurement of the nanoparticle weight fraction of the nanoparticle doped polymer tubes, the tubes were completely dissolved in ultrapure aqua regia (HNO<sub>3</sub>/HCl 3/1, v/v). Diluted solutions thereof were examined by means of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) on a Thermo IRIS Intrepid II XSP atomic emission spectrometer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0885328212443393"><title>Micro-computed tomography</title>
<p>Micro-computed tomography (µCT) scans were performed using a SkyScan 1172 (Skyscan 1172, SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium). The acceleration voltage of the X-ray source was 80 kV, the current 100 µA. No filter was used; the resolution was set to 34.4 µm. Grey-scale measurements were made over the length of the polymer tube. 500 measurement values were recorded and averaged. A polymethyl methacrylate stairway (10 steps) with defined step height (980 µm) served as reference as well as a nanoparticle-free reference tube. Thus, the µCT was used to assess the radiopacitiy. The radiopacity is provided as the percentage grey-scale value (gs) change compared to the reference tube. The radiopacity were calculated according to the following equation: radiopacity = (gs<sub>sample</sub>−gs<sub>reference</sub>/gs<sub>reference</sub>) × 100%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0885328212443393"><title>Magnetic resonance imaging</title>
<p>Magnetic resonance images (MRI) were acquired using an MR scanner (7.1 T, ClinScan, Bruker BioScan GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). All polymer tubes investigated were put in 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution and imaged using a phased array surface coil (rat brain). The polymer minitubes were measured transversally with 2 coil elements and longitudinally with 4 coil elements. The imaging parameters in the first case were TE 41 ms, TR 2000 ms, 10 slices and a gap of 0% between the slices and in the second case TE 15 ms, TR 6000 ms, 10 slices and a gap of 0% between the slices. Signal intensities of the magnetite modified polymer blanks were measured against a nanoparticle-free minitube.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0885328212443393"><title>Thermal imaging by infrared diode laser</title>
<p>To investigate the behavior of gold nanoparticle doped minitubes in response to infrared excitation the Zeiss Visulas II diode laser system (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany) with a wavelength of 810 nm and a power of 0.1–2.5 W were used. Laser settings were fixed at 1500 mW of power applied for 1500 ms. Thermographic examination was performed with the thermal infrared camera AGEMA 470 (Agema Infrared Systems AB, Danderyd, Sweden) in standardised microclimatic conditions in the spectral sensitivity range of 2–5 µm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0885328212443393"><title>Mechanical testing</title>
<p>Mechanical properties of the polymeric minitubes were assessed at 37℃ in air in uniaxial tensile tests with a universal testing machine ZWICKI ZN 2.5 (Zwick, Ulm, Germany). The tensile tests were carried out with a clamping length of 20 mm in controlled deformation mode with a cross-head speed of 40 mm/min until specimen fracture. Stress–strain curves were recorded, and the elastic modulus, tensile strength and elongation at break were evaluated.</p>

<p>In our investigations we embedded spherical gold, silver and magnetite nanoparticles in the PLLA/P(4HB) matrix to compare various modified polymeric minitubes. These nanoparticles were selected because of their special properties, ease of preparation via chemical routes from solution and their low toxicity. Optical properties of gold nanoparticles significantly depend on their size and shape. For instance, gold nanorods respond to near infrared radiation with temperature increase, making them suitable for hyperthermic induction and thermal visualisation. Silver nanoparticles, synthesised in a similar fashion as gold nanoparticles, have the advantage to exhibit germicidal effects because of the release of ionised silver, Ag<sup>+</sup>, without high toxicity to humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328212443393">23</xref></sup> Thus, the wide-spectrum antimicrobial activity of silver can be beneficial both in the production process and in the intended clinical application for polymeric scaffolds. Magnetite nanoparticles are easy and inexpensive to produce in large quantities and can be especially useful as MRI contrast markers.</p>
<sec id="sec17-0885328212443393"><title>Synthesis, characterisation and incorporation of nanoparticles</title>
<p>Gold, silver and magnetite nanoparticles were used with a lipophilic capping agent in a narrow size-range so that they could easily be suspended in an organic solvent necessary for polymer dissolution. The size, distribution and shape of the used nanoparticles were determined by means of TEM and SEM. In this context, we confirmed that the gold nanoparticles with a spherical shape have an average particle size of approximately 10 nm for the small one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212443393">Figure 1(a)</xref>) and approximately 100 nm for the larger one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212443393">Figure 1(d)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212443393">e</xref>)). The rod-shaped gold nanoparticles have a size of 10 × 45 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212443393">Figure 1(f)</xref>). The synthesised silver nanoparticles have a spherical shape and an average particle size of approximately 10 nm, similar to the magnetite and small gold nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212443393">Figure 1(a)</xref> to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212443393">c</xref>)).

<p>For thermal imaging purposes UV/visible spectra of the investigated nanoparticles were recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328212443393">Figure 2</xref>). Spherical nanoparticles show one peak within the range of 200 to 600 nm depending on the kind of nanoparticle. In contrast, gold nanorods exhibit two peaks due to the transverse and longitudinal surface plasmon resonances corresponding to electron oscillations perpendicular and parallel to the rod length direction, respectively. The transverse surface plasmon wavelength is located in the visible spectrum (508 nm), whereas the longitudinal surface plasmon wavelength is shifted towards the near infrared region (820 nm).

<p>In order to incorporate the nanoparticles in the PLLA/P(4HB) matrix, the nanoparticles were suspended in chloroform and carefully mixed with the polymer blend suspension.

<p>The nanoparticle containing PLLA/P(4HB) suspensions were used in a dip-coating process to manufacture the nanoparticle doped polymeric minitubes. Although the nanoparticle containing PLLA/P(4HB) solutions and accordingly modified minitubes seem to be homogeneous because of their even colouring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328212443393">Figure 3</xref>), TEM samples of the manufactured tubes reveal a partially agglomeration of nanoparticles in the cured polymer matrix as is shown exemplarily for PLLA/P(4HB) with a gold nanoparticle content of 0.1% (w) and with a magnetite nanoparticle content of 4.5% (w) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328212443393">Figure 4</xref>).

<p>However, in our view the described deviations are negligible and result comparability is warranted for the conducted investigations. Nevertheless, extrusion of the polymeric minitubes could be better in addressing the needs of reproducibility for a medical application and therefore may be subject to later work.</p>
<p>The retaining of the incorporated nanoparticles in the polymer blend was examined indirectly. After the minitubes were produced the tubes were washed in polar solvents, water and methanol, for 24 h respectively, to remove TEC and chloroform residues. The washing residues were completely colourless, and the colour of the modified tubes remained unchanged. It may therefore be concluded that no significant amounts of nanoparticles, which exhibit an intense colour in the visible spectroscopic region, were washed out. Hence, in a potential in vivo setting the incorporated nanoparticles should be firmly anchored in the polymer matrix and should not leach out in body environment, at least over a short time period. However, since a biodegradable polymer blend was used, it is assumed that the incorporated nanoparticles will be released as the polymer blend degrades. This fact is to be considered if such modified vascular scaffolds are applied clinically. However, we have not yet assessed the influence of blood and cell responses to our nanoparticle-polymer composites in own studies. According to the literature, potential toxicity effects will be derived from the two distinct components, the polymer blend (P(4HB)/PLLA), and the kind of nanoparticles (gold, silver and magnetite). In this context, the biocompatibility of nanoparticles was investigated in general,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328212443393">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328212443393"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328212443393">26</xref></sup> and in particular for gold,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328212443393">27</xref></sup> silver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328212443393">28</xref></sup> and magnetite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328212443393">29</xref></sup> nanoparticles, as well as separately for the used biodegradable polymers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328212443393">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328212443393"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328212443393">32</xref></sup> These data suggests that the clinical application of the nanoparticle doped polymeric stents should not be limited by their biocompatibility.

<sec id="sec19-0885328212443393"><title>Radiopacity of nanoparticle doped polymeric minitubes</title>
<p>X-ray screening is used to monitor the scaffold implantation and correct scaffold position after the intervention. Therefore, scaffolds should have an adequate radiopacity and especially polymeric scaffolds need an enhancement due to their low radiopacity. Furthermore, in case of biodegradable polymeric scaffolds X-ray screening could yield an insight into how far advanced the degradation/fragmentation process is and therefore the current functionality of the implant. In this context, the gold, silver and magnetite nanoparticle doped polymeric minitubes were investigated for their capability to enhance the radiopacity depending on the kind, size, shape and content of the incorporated nanoparticles.</p>
<p>Therefore, spherical gold, silver and magnetite nanoparticles of approximately 10 nm in size incorporated in a PLLA/P(4HB) matrix of polymer minitubes in different contents were investigated by means of X-ray contrast in the first run.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328212443393">Figure 6</xref> indicates that with increasing nanoparticle content the radiopacity of the nanoparticle doped minitubes increases nearly linearly. For instance, the radiopacity of a minitube modified with 7% (w) gold nanoparticles was improved by approximately 40% compared with a nanoparticle free reference minitube, which is exemplary shown in the X-ray projection images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328212443393">Figure 5(b)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328212443393">c</xref>)).
<fig id="fig6-0885328212443393" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Capability of gold, silver and magnetite nanoparticle doped polymeric PLLA/P(4HB) minitubes (n = 5) to enhance the radiopacity depending on the kind, the concentration and partially the size and shape of the incorporated nanoparticles.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328212443393-fig6.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Modified minitubes with the same size, shape and content of nanoparticles but with different nanoparticle material (gold, silver, magnetite) differ barely within a range of 5–10% in their capability to enhance the radiopacity. Due to the fact that all of the investigated nanoparticles enhance the radiopacity in a similar range, the additional properties of the nanoparticles, such as the antibacterial and antifungal effect of silver, the simultaneous magnetic resonance enhancement of magnetite or the capability for external stimuli of gold nanorods, are relevant for the intended scaffold application.</p>
<p>In order to get an impression of the dependency of the radiopacity on nanoparticle size and shape, the minitubes were modified with approx. 0.1% (w) gold nanoparticles of different sizes (10 and 100 nm) and shapes (spherical and rod-shaped). Here as well, the comparative analyses revealed that radiopacity in the investigated range depends only marginally on size and shape of the embedded nanoparticles for the same incorporated metal content in the polymer matrix. Solely, the use of rod-shaped gold nanoparticles compared to spherical gold nanoparticles exhibited a slightly increased radiopacity. In general, radiopacity depends on the absolute nanoparticle number and mass.</p>

<sec id="sec20-0885328212443393"><title>Visibility of magnetic nanoparticle doped polymeric minitubes in the MRI</title>
<p>MRI provides higher contrast between the different soft tissues of the body than computed tomography does, and thus seems suitable for imaging of polymeric scaffolds in the body. Indeed, a polymeric scaffold is particularly better suited for MRI than its metallic counterpart because unlike a metallic stent it does effectively not cause any imaging artifacts (i.e. a region of signal void, which extends beyond the stent boundaries) at all.</p>
<p>The MRI technique is based on excitation and relaxation of hydrogen nuclei. Intrinsic longitudinal (T<sub>1</sub>) and transverse (T<sub>2</sub>) relaxation times of different hydrogen containing compounds bring about changes of magnetic resonance signal intensity, which in turn results in an imaging contrast. The imaging contrast of magnetic resonance arises from the different relaxation times of different carbon–hydrogen compounds. Polymers contain hydrogen atoms; however, their emitted RF signal is quite broad. In order to obtain an image with well-defined mapping, contrast agents are utilised. The relaxation times can be manipulated by the use of T<sub>1</sub> (e.g. gadolinium and manganese chelates) and T<sub>2</sub> (e.g. magnetic nanoparticles) contrast agents, producing brighter (T<sub>1</sub>-weighted) and darker (T<sub>2</sub>-weighted) regions where they are accumulated.</p>
<p>In this respect, magnetite nanoparticles of 10 nm size were added to the PLLA/P(4HB) matrix to change its magnetic susceptibility, assuming they can be safely released in the body during the biodegradation of this PLLA/P(4HB) based scaffold material. Acquired magnetic resonance images of magnetite nanoparticle doped PLLA/P(4HB) minitubes exhibited a decreasing signal intensity depending on incorporated magnetite nanoparticle content. For instance, a modified minitube doped with 4.5% (w) magnetite nanoparticles showed a three-fold decrease in signal intensity compared to a nanoparticle free minitube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212443393">Figure 7(a)</xref>). Furthermore, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212443393">Figure 7(b)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212443393">c</xref>) represent the MRI images of minitubes containing 10% (w) magnetite in the longitudinal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212443393">Figure 7(b)</xref>) and transversal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212443393">Figure 7(c)</xref>) perspective.

<p>This result demonstrates that the embedding of magnetite nanoparticles enhances the visibility of the polymeric scaffold material via MRI next to the fluoroscopy. Thus, the magnetite doped minitubes are visible with both imaging methods.</p>

<p>An optical window where living tissue absorbs relatively little light is located in the near infrared spectrum. This window runs approximately from 650 to 1200 nm. At shorter wavelengths light is strongly absorbed by hemoglobin in blood, while at longer wavelengths water strongly absorbs infrared light.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the optical contrast and to stimuli heat generation in the near infrared domain PLLA/P(4HB), minitubes with incorporated rod-shaped gold nanoparticles (absorption maxima: 820 nm) were prepared. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328212443393">Figure 8(a)</xref> demonstrates the experimental set-up where minitubes modified with gold nanorods and unmodified minitubes were excited with a simple red light lamp through two differently concentrated (2%, 6%, w/v) agarose gel blocks serving as simulated tissue. The captured thermal image illustrates the local heating up to 27℃ for the modified blank and 22℃ for tubes without incorporated gold nanoparticles after short exposure time. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of such modified scaffold materials for imaging in the near infrared domain.

<p>A narrower excitation with a punctual near infrared laser impulse in the range of the absorption maxima of the embedded gold nanorods causes a focal heating up to 67℃ which is much higher than the 40℃ reached for tubes with incorporated spherical gold nanoparticles and 23℃ for the unmodified minitubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328212443393">Figure 8(b)</xref>).

<sec id="sec22-0885328212443393"><title>Mechanical tests of nanoparticle doped polymeric scaffolds</title>
<p>A coronary scaffold has to fulfil a number of mechanical requirements. First, the scaffold must be capable of withstanding the structural loads, namely radial compressive forces, imposed on the scaffold as it supports the vessel wall. Aside from the adequate radial strength, the scaffold should be longitudinally flexible, allowing it to be manoeuvred through a tortuous vascular path and to enable the scaffold to conform to a deployment site that may not be straight or may be subject to flexure. The scaffold material has to allow for scaffold expansion which typically requires substantial local deformation of the scaffold structure. Once expanded, the scaffold has to maintain size and shape throughout its service life despite the various imposed forces including the cyclic loading induced by the beating heart.</p>
<p>Generally, the incorporation of solid inorganic particles in a polymer matrix results in increased stiffness, lowered tensile strength and enhanced thermal resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328212443393">33</xref></sup> In contrast to polymer composites with filler materials in the micrometer dimension, polymer nanocomposites exhibit improved properties, such as increased strength, chemical and heat resistance, even at small amounts of filler materials. This is attributed to the size of the filler material and the macromolecules (radius of gyration) being on the same scale, the large specific surface of the nano-sized particle offering a closer polymer–filler interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328212443393">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to investigate the influence of nanoparticle incorporation on the mechanical properties of the scaffold material, the PLLA/P(4HB) minitubes modified with spherical gold, silver and magnetite nanoparticle of approx. 10 nm size were subjected to tensile tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328212443393">Figure 9</xref>).
<fig id="fig9-0885328212443393" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Results of the mechanical investigations of nanoparticle doped PLLA/P(4HB) minitubes (each with n = 5): elastic modulus (a), tensile strength (b), breaking strain (c).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328212443393-fig9.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>After incorporation of the nanoparticles, a decrease in mechanical properties compared to unmodified blanks was observed, particularly when an amount &gt;1% of incorporated nanoparticles was used. Apparently, the incorporated nanoparticles weaken the polymer matrix, which may be attributed to their spherical shape and their lipophilic ligands. For a nanoparticle content of 4–8%, tensile strength was reduced by 50–100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328212443393">Figure 9(b)</xref>). The breaking strain was reduced by 50–150% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328212443393">Figure 9(c)</xref>), depending on the nanoparticle type, whereas the breaking strain was slightly increased when the amount of embedded nanoparticles was &lt;1%.</p>
<p>It is well known that the interparticle distance between the embedded particles in the polymer matrix plays an important role for the toughness mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328212443393">35</xref></sup> Since the embedded nanoparticles are not ideally distributed in the polymer matrix but are present as more or less larger aggregates, as already shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328212443393">Figure 4</xref>, a distinct influence of the different nanoparticle types on the investigated mechanical properties cannot be observed. Furthermore, the standard deviation in the tensile tests is greater for the with nanoparticles modified scaffolds, maybe due to the mechanical discontinuities in the polymer matrix caused by the incorporation of the nanoparticles or agglomerates thereof.</p>
<p>It is known that the shape of the nanoparticulate filler material largely influences the properties of polymer composites in such a way that incorporated particles with larger aspect ratio (rods, fibers and plates) lead to considerable improvement of tensile and tear strength stability as well as rigidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328212443393">36</xref></sup> Since only samples with incorporated spherical nanoparticles were investigated in our study a major contribution towards these properties by the shape of the nanoparticles was not expected.</p>

The nanoparticle containing polymeric minitubes could be cut with similar laser parameters as nanoparticle free tubes. A darkening of the scaffold colour was observed in the laser affected zone, which is attributed to a rearrangement of both the polymer chains and the embedded nanoparticles by thermal effects. Moreover, it appeared that a forced agglomeration or increased concentration of nanoparticles in this zone had been induced. This may lead to an increased visibility of such zones. The application of the new laser generation (femto- or picosecond pulsed laser source) for machining is likely to reduce the laser action zone significantly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328212443393">37</xref></sup>

<p>With the purpose to improve image enhancement in X-ray, magnetic resonance or near-infrared imaging and the mechanical properties of the biodegradable polymeric scaffold material poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactide)/poly(4-hydroxybutyrate) we investigated the potential of incorporated gold, silver and magnetite nanoparticles.</p>
<p>In this context, we found that used nanoparticles can be incorporated easily in the PLLA/P(4HB) matrix if they have an appropriate lipophilic surface modification. In the processing of the polymer nanoparticle suspension to minitubes by the applied dip-coating process, no significant changes toward the pure PLLA/P(4HB) solution occurred by addition of up to 10% (w) nanoparticles. Moreover, the manufactured nanoparticle doped minitubes could be further processed to nanoparticle doped scaffold prototypes as good as nanoparticle free tubes, which has been shown by laser cutting.</p>
<p>In respect to the employed X-ray experiments, gold, silver and magnetite modified polymeric tubes exhibit an increased radiopacity of up to 40% and therefore an enhanced visibility with a linear relation to low embedded nanoparticle content by mass.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our investigations demonstrate that magnetite nanoparticles enhance the visibility of the PLLA/P(4HB) scaffold material via MRI next to the X-ray based fluoroscopy procedures. In this context, the MRI signal intensity is decreased three-fold using polymeric tubes with 4.5% (w) embedded magnetite nanoparticles.</p>
<p>In contrast to the investigated spherical nanoparticles, the rod-shaped gold nanoparticles enhanced the visibility in the near infrared domain at 820 nm. Additionally, the use of gold nanorods in polymer scaffolds renders the latter sensitive to external stimuli for heat generation, e.g. to more than 67℃ via infrared radiation. Consequently, such modified scaffold material can be used apart from the visual enhancement for local heat generation with the purpose to release drugs from thermoresponsive scaffold coatings, or to locally obliterate surrounding tissue.</p>
<p>Regarding the mechanical influence of the incorporated nanoparticles, a softening of the material was observed due to their spheroidal shape and lipophilic behavior.</p>
<p>Consequently, incorporation of nanoparticles will have to be further adapted to the PLLA/P(4HB) matrix through their shape and surface functionality in order to contribute substantially to a potential mechanical strengthening of the resulting polymeric scaffold.</p>
<p>In summary, the embedded gold, silver and magnetite nanoparticles enhance the visibility of PLLA/P(4HB) based polymeric scaffolds for improved monitoring of the scaffold implantation procedure. Furthermore, they can provide additional functionality depending on the type of nanoparticle material, such as the germicidal effect of silver nanoparticles as well as hyperthermia of gold and magnetite nanoparticles in conjunction with an external stimulus. Therefore, the approach here represents a promising therapeutic opportunity for use in cardiology and other minimally invasive interventions. To this end, further development of the investigated PLLA/P(4HB)/nanoparticle composites regarding a more enhanced visual effect with corequisite mechanical stabilisation of the polymer matrix is necessary.</p>
