<p>Jeffery Webber’s <italic>From Rebellion to Reform in Bolivia</italic> is a welcome addition to the recent literature on Bolivia. Rather than unreservedly celebrating gains in indigenous rights and political participation and the election of “Bolivia’s first indigenous president,” Webber criticizes President Evo Morales and the Movimiento al Socialismo (Movement toward Socialism—MAS) for failing to achieve fundamental changes in Bolivian economic and social structures and for “reconstituting” rather than replacing neoliberalism. The book’s fundamental contribution to current analysis of the Bolivian “process of change” is to remind us that even as we celebrate gains at the level of cultural and identity politics, we must not neglect class in any project committed to fundamental societal transformation.</p>
<p>Webber breaks the discussion into two sections for a total of seven chapters preceded by an introductory essay. The four chapters of the first section incorporate articles originally published in 2008, which together account for about two-thirds of the text. After an introduction to Bolivia’s economic and social structure and the protest cycle that led up to Morales’s election, Webber examines both the electoral victory and the major policies implemented during Morales’s first year. He begins with the five years leading up to the election, citing sitting Vice-President Alvaro García Linera’s use of Marx’s definition of a “revolutionary epoch” as a “period of intense political activity” that broadly challenges the state (47). This is a critical concept in that it implies that the potential existed for a “social revolution” that would have brought about “basic changes in social structure and in political structure” (47). Webber argues that Morales and the MAS, through their pursuit of an electoral strategy, “dampened the immediate prospects of a socialist and indigenous-liberationist revolution” (2). This interesting assertion contains the implicit assumption—despite Webber’s recognition of the contingent nature of revolutionary epochs (46)—that, had the uprising not been derailed by the MAS’s electoral strategy, Bolivia would have had a successful social revolution. However, the last revolutionary epoch in Bolivia, from 1978 to 1985, saw multiple governments before the 1982 return to civilian rule, which, of course, was followed by the 1985 victory not of an indigenous “reformer” but of the architect of 20 years of neoliberal rule. The result was the evisceration of the labor movement that had to that point been the vanguard of demands for structural change.</p>
<p>The second section of the book contains two substantive chapters—on the ideological and economic structures of reconstituted neoliberalism—followed by a short conclusion. Webber discusses the 2009 election and the way Morales is perceived in the international press: glorified by the left and vilified by the right with little material evidence provided by either side. Webber then turns to the contradictions between Morales’s rhetoric, whether attacking “savage capitalism” in international forums or describing the “nationalization” of hydrocarbons and mining, and the material reality of political practices that have increased dependence on resource extraction with transnational capitalist “partners” (169–170). Webber observes that even given its massive electoral victories, the MAS, rather than push a radical agenda, continues to be “soft on oligarchs, hard on workers” (129). He argues that the Morales administration has adopted the same neostructuralist policies as other “pink tide” administrations in Latin America and that these tend to reconstitute rather than replace neoliberalism.</p>
<p>I fundamentally agree with Webber’s argument—indeed, the MAS has not restructured Bolivia economically and has missed opportunities to implement even less-than-radical restructuring. However, he seems to trivialize the accomplishments of the Morales administration. The government did increase its share of hydrocarbon rents, which have financed small but significant transfer payments that have reduced indigence and had positive effects on rural communities. (For a critical but somewhat more generous analysis of the first Morales administration see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12453895">Kohl and Bresnahan, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12453895">2010b</xref>.) The MAS has also created space for indigenous and grassroots leaders to occupy government positions that had been traditionally the space of urban middle-class elites, although with mixed results in terms of rent-seeking, institutional capacity, and the development and implementation of coherent policies. The MAS also achieved passage of a new but certainly flawed constitution. Should we dismiss the significant gains in indigenous representation, attempts to reinvent the nation, and moderate material gains that have had a real impact on the everyday lives of the majority of poor Bolivians?</p>
<p>Webber also implies not only that Morales had a coherent political analysis before entering office but also that he is responsible for the limited achievements (and greater shortcomings) of his administration. Finally, even as Webber, following Trotsky, clearly prioritizes the importance of understanding “the international context of global capitalism and imperialism” (15), he ignores the debates on achieving a socialist revolution in one country, especially one as small and historically dependent as Bolivia (227). The experience of the counterrevolution following the Sandinista victory in Nicaragua that cost over 50,000 lives should serve as a reminder of the possible price of successful revolution in a small country. Given the current reality of global politics, can we discard an electoral strategy as a path to change?</p>
<p>The strength of Webber’s analysis certainly helps to frame discussion of the Bolivian process. Yet, unfortunately, the first four chapters, originally published in 2008, appear to have been only lightly edited and partially updated, and Chapters 5 and 6 have the feel of stand-alone pieces. As a result, while I could comfortably use any of the chapters in a course, the book contains a great deal of repetition that would limit its use as a text. And that is a shame, because Webber’s critique is one that deserves to be widely read.</p>
