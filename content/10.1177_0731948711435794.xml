<abstract>
<p>This article provides a synthesis of note-taking research among students with learning disabilities or other high-incidence disabilities. A search of the professional literature between 1980 and 2010 yielded nine intervention studies, which were evaluated either in terms of effect size or percentage of nonoverlapping data. The studies examined three different note-taking techniques used by students during lectures and included 125 students of varying disabilities. Findings revealed that students who used note-taking techniques were effective at increasing scores on measures of achievement and the quality and quantity of notes recorded. Limitations and implications of note-taking techniques for content-area classrooms are discussed.</p>

<p>For secondary students with learning disabilities (LD), learning during lectures has taken an elevated level of importance in recent years as more of these students must now pass end-of-the-year state tests to advance in courses, graduate from high school, and become prepared for college or postsecondary institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948711435794">Deshler, Schumaker, Bui, &amp; Vernon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731948711435794">Scruggs, Mastropieri, &amp; Okolo, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948711435794">Newman, Wagner, Cameto, Knokey, and Shaver (2010)</xref> reported that approximately 45% of youth with disabilities now attend postsecondary education institutions within 4 years of graduation from high school, with the largest majority of those students being students with LD. For students with LD and other high-incidence disabilities, this means that they must not only have access to the general education curriculum but also be able to effectively use many different academic learning skills, such as note- taking, to comprehend the content from their classes and pass rigorous academic courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948711435794">Deshler et al., 2006</xref>). In many of these content-area courses, lectures comprise a major portion of students’ time (i.e., typically 28% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731948711435794">Johnson, 2008</xref>] to 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0731948711435794">Putnam, Deshler, &amp; Schumaker, 1993</xref>]), and note-taking is perhaps the most crucial skill used to assist students to understand and learn content during lectures.</p>
<p>Recording notes allows students to actively follow the lecture, consciously select important from unimportant information, and rephrase lecture points in their own words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0731948711435794">Steimle, Brdiczka, &amp; Mühlhäuser, 2009</xref>). When students use note-taking skills during lectures, they increase their encoding of lecture content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0731948711435794">Shrager &amp; Mayer, 1989</xref>). Recording notes not only helps students recall information from lectures, but according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948711435794">Kobayashi (2005)</xref>, note-taking among K–12 students facilitates their <italic>understanding</italic> of lecture content, which, in turn, enhances retention of information. In addition, because teachers frequently construct tests from information found in their lectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0731948711435794">Putnam et al., 1993</xref>), taking notes helps students to preserve the content of the lecture so that they can have it for later review as they prepare for class tests and quizzes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948711435794">Mulligan &amp; Kirkpatrick, 2000</xref>). In fact, a number of studies have reported significant correlations (i.e., from .42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731948711435794">Fisher &amp; Harris, 1973</xref>] to .53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0731948711435794">Titsworth, 2004</xref>]) between what students record in their notes from a lecture and their performance on recall measures and tests. Finally, although other variables (e.g., verbal memory, grade point average [GPA]) are useful predictors of school performance, the quality or quantity of notes (see Note 1) has been found to be a key predictor of test outcomes among older students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0731948711435794">Peverly et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the specific problems that students with disabilities encounter while note-taking, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948711435794">Suritsky (1992)</xref> found that students with LD have a difficult time discerning important from unimportant lecture content, paying attention during lectures, and writing quickly enough to keep up with the lecture. Students’ difficulties are often reflected in their performance on measures of comprehension and recall, as well as the quality and quantity of notes recorded during lectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731948711435794">Hughes &amp; Suritsky, 1994</xref>). As for the quality of students’ notes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711435794">Boyle (2010a)</xref> found that middle school students with LD recorded only 18% of cued lecture points that were presented in the lecture, when compared with peers without disabilities, who recorded 42% of the cued lecture points. Overall, the notes of students with LD contained only half of the total lecture points when compared with the notes of peers without disabilities. With respect to the quantity of notes recorded, middle school students with LD recorded fewer notes than their peers without disabilities during lectures, recording an average of 57 words per note, compared with an average 130 words for nondisabled students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010a</xref>). Finally, these differences in the amount of notes recorded were reflected in lower scores on measures of comprehension of lecture content (e.g., students with LD: 47%, nondisabled students: 67%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>Note-taking interventions for students in general education have been developed and assessed, with mixed results. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948711435794">Palmatier (1971)</xref> trained high school students to use one of four note-taking techniques during lectures: outline notes, three-column Cornell notes, two-column notes, and traditional notes. The study results indicated no significant differences on achievement, with only the group that used the two-column method showing improvement in the quality of notes recorded from pre- to posttraining levels. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948711435794">Risch and Kiewra (1990)</xref> trained general education middle school students to use one of three note-taking techniques (traditional, linear, or matrix) during a lecture and, when they studied notes (e.g., their own notes or expert notes), across three measures (across-topic, within-topic, and application). The results concluded that matrix notes were more effective for female students who created them than for students studying from them. In addition, students who used the matrix notes on the application task scored higher than when using the other note-taking techniques.</p>
<sec id="section1-0731948711435794">
<title>Study Purpose</title>
<p>In response to the unique note-taking problems that students with LD and other high-incidence disabilities exhibit, several researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans, Pelham, &amp; Grudberg, 1994–1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>) developed and assessed note-taking techniques for these students. Although academic interventions (e.g., classroom learning strategies, mnemonic instruction, explicit instruction, study aids, graphic organizers) to improve student learning in secondary content areas for students with disabilities were examined in a previous meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0731948711435794">Scruggs, Mastropieri, Berkeley, &amp; Graetz, 2010</xref>), specific note-taking techniques have not been thoroughly examined through a systematic review of the literature in the school-age population (Grades 3–12) of students with disabilities. Therefore, the purpose of the current systematic review was to answer the following two questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0731948711435794" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What research-based note-taking interventions for students with disabilities are available in the literature?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How effective are these interventions on measures of achievement and notes recorded?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0731948711435794" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A three-step procedure was used to locate potential articles for inclusion in this systematic review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731948711435794">Gajria, Jitendra, Sood, &amp; Sacks, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0731948711435794">Wexler, Vaughn, Edmonds, &amp; Reutebuch, 2008</xref>). The following descriptors were used to identify potential studies: note(s), guided notes, note-taking (and notetaking), lecture, lecture notes, recording notes, strategic note, lecture learning, and content lecture. First, we conducted a search to locate studies between the years 1980 and 2010 in the following databases: Academic Search Complete, ERIC, MEDLINE, PAIS International, Periodicals Index Online, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Wilson OmniFile Full Text. Whenever possible, searches were restricted to peer-reviewed journals in the disciplines of education and psychology between the years 1980 and 2010 and had to be in English. From this initial search, more than 9,000 abstracts were identified; however, many were duplications of other searchers or were not relevant to our review (e.g., recording notes in psychotherapy, recording notes when serving on a jury).</p>
<p>Second, we conducted a computer search through popular special education journals that were most representative of journals that publish research on students with disabilities: <italic>Education and Treatment of Children, Exceptional Children, Exceptionality, Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, Journal of Behavioral Education, Journal of Learning Disabilities, Journal of School Psychology, Journal of Special Education, Learning Disability Quarterly, Psychology in the Schools, Remedial and Special Education, School Psychology Quarterly, School Psychology Review</italic>, and <italic>Teacher Education and Special Education</italic>. In all cases but one, we were able to go through each abstract and article title from the aforementioned journals from January 1980 to December 2010. In the case of <italic>Remedial and Special Education</italic>, we were only able to view each issue’s abstracts back through 1984 (see Note 2). Despite this extensive search, no new articles were found. Third, as was done in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731948711435794">Gajria et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0731948711435794">Wexler et al., 2008</xref>), we performed an ancestral search through the references of identified articles and seminal articles on note-taking from special education and general education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731948711435794">Bretzing &amp; Kulhavy, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948711435794">Di Vesta &amp; Gray, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711435794">Hartley &amp; Davies, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731948711435794">Hughes &amp; Suritsky, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731948711435794">Kiewra, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731948711435794">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948711435794">Saski, Swicegood, &amp; Carter, 1983</xref>) to locate any additional articles. From this review of the references, no new articles were identified.</p>
<sec id="section3-0731948711435794">
<title>Selection Criteria</title>
<p>Studies were selected if they met the following criteria:</p>
<sec id="section4-0731948711435794">
<title>Search span</title>
<p>The study appeared in a peer-refereed journal article between January 1980 and December 2010. The start date of 1980 was chosen because it was during this decade that the earliest articles began to appear in education- or psychology-refereed journals on the topic of note-taking for use during lectures for students with disabilities. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948711435794">Saski et al. (1983)</xref> were the earliest authors to suggest the use of the columnar note-taking technique for students with LD. Even though the article was only descriptive in nature (and did not meet the criteria used here), it was nevertheless the earliest article to describe a note-taking technique for students with disabilities to use during lectures and, hence, 1980 served as the start date.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0731948711435794">
<title>Design</title>
<p>The study utilized treatment-comparison, single-group, or single-subject designs were included. Previous syntheses and meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0731948711435794">Wexler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0731948711435794">Xin &amp; Jitendra, 1999</xref>) have examined topics that incorporated multiple design options, particularly when the unique nature of the independent variable (e.g., repeated readings, mathematical problem solving) allows for researchers to examine its effects over the short and long term.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0731948711435794">
<title>Grades 3 to 12 students with an identified disability</title>
<p>The study included in its sample participants who were in Grades 3–12 and who had an identified disability. Although students with LD were the targeted population, in our search no disability areas were excluded. We chose Grade 3 as the starting grade because this was the lowest grade level identified in research studies that used a note-taking intervention (e.g., strategic note-taking) during lectures with the school-age population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731948711435794">Lee, Lan, Hamman, &amp; Hendricks, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0731948711435794">
<title>Independent and dependent variables</title>
<p>The study examined the effects of a note-taking technique or intervention (i.e., independent variable) that students used during teacher-led lectures on one or more measures (i.e., dependent variables) of achievement or notes. We purposefully limited the use of note-taking interventions to teacher-led lectures (i.e., those lectures where students are recording notes on new content). We did not include any studies that examined recording notes during reading activities because we felt that reading content via textbooks and listening to class lectures are two distinctly different activities, each of which has a different outcome and to which students with disabilities respond differently. Furthermore, the main focus of this synthesis was to examine the effects of note-taking interventions during teacher-led lectures in content areas.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0731948711435794">
<title>Coding Procedures</title>
<p>Following the initial database search, the first author conducted a screening based on the descriptors and information found in the title and abstract. A similar procedure of identifying potential articles by examining each abstract and title has been used in prior syntheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731948711435794">Gajria et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0731948711435794">Wexler et al., 2008</xref>). Because there were known studies that included college and high school students with disabilities within the same note-taking article, articles involving college students were retained for possible inclusion in the initial screening review. For example, the article of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">Lazarus (1993)</xref> contained the results of two studies. In the first study, high school students with LD or emotional/behavioral disabilities (EBD) were assessed on their use of guided notes; in the second study, college students with LD were assessed on their use of guided notes. This screening resulted in 52 <italic>potential</italic> articles, with many of these including college students. Once we examined either the abstract or the article and were able to identify the population with certainty, we were able to reduce the number of articles to 17 that used note-taking interventions with school-age populations.</p>
<p>From this list of 17, the first author and second author met, read each article, and determined whether each met all criteria. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. Eight of the articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731948711435794">Ayer &amp; Milson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948711435794">Bretzing, Kulhavy, &amp; Caterino, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731948711435794">Huffman &amp; Spires, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731948711435794">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948711435794">Palmatier, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0731948711435794">Peck &amp; Hannafin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0731948711435794">Peper &amp; Mayer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948711435794">Risch &amp; Kiewra, 1990</xref>) were eliminated because although they used a note-taking intervention among general education populations, they did not include any students with disabilities. A ninth article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731948711435794">Mastropieri, Scruggs, Spencer, &amp; Fontana, 2003</xref>) was also eliminated because of the manner in which the note-taking intervention was used. In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731948711435794">Mastropieri et al. (2003)</xref> study, students first read the chapter or sections of the chapter and then completed guided notes while the teacher circulated around the room and assisted students. Only after students completed the guided notes from their readings did the teacher review the guided notes on an overhead to ensure they were complete. In this case, we viewed guided notes as being used as a postreading activity rather than as a note-taking intervention that students with disabilities completed during class lectures. The end result of this final review was a total of nine studies that matched all of the criteria. These studies were then coded based on year, author(s), participant characteristics (e.g., disability, age, gender), setting, independent variable, comparison intervention, dependent variables, and results. Both authors constructed tables based on the coded variables. A comparison of the tables indicated 100% agreement.</p>

<title>Effect Size (ES) Calculation</title>
<p>ESs were calculated for experimental–control group, single-group, and single-subject research studies that provided sufficient statistical information. For experimental–control group studies, the ES was estimated using Hedges’s <italic>g</italic>, whereby the difference is derived by the average experimental group score minus the average control group score and divided by the pooled standard deviation. For the single-group studies, the difference was determined by the average posttest score minus the average pretest score divided by the pretest standard deviation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731948711435794">Becker, 1988</xref>). The effects of the one single-group study were computed using standardized pre–post mean differences and then converted to the <italic>g</italic> metric. In addition, some studies contained small sample sizes (i.e., less than 20 participants), causing the ES to be biased by overestimating the effects of the treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948711435794">Cooper, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948711435794">Hedges, 1981</xref>). Therefore, in all of the studies in our synthesis, analyses were conducted using Hedges’s <italic>g</italic> because it represents a more conservative ES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948711435794">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948711435794">Cohen (1988)</xref>, ESs can be interpreted as follows: ES = 0.20 (small), ES = 0.50 (medium), and ES = 0.80 (large). Finally, to determine the effects of single-subject research, percentage of nonoverlapping data (PND) was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731948711435794">Scruggs &amp; Mastropieri, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948711435794">Scruggs, Mastropieri, &amp; Casto, 1987</xref>). In terms of the effectiveness using PND, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731948711435794">Scruggs and Mastropieri (1998)</xref> reported that PND scores more than 90 (i.e., treatment data points that exceed highest baseline data point by 90%) are <italic>very effective</italic>; PND scores between 70 and 90 are <italic>effective</italic>; PND scores between 50 and 70 are <italic>questionable</italic>; and PND scores below 50 are considered <italic>ineffective</italic>. These guidelines were used because they are the only published guidelines available in the literature for deciding the effectiveness of PND methods.</p>

<p>As previously noted, the final sample consisted of nine studies found in eight articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton, Seibert, Gardner, &amp; Talbert-Johnson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711435794">Patterson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711435794">Sweeney et al., 1999</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al. (1994–1995)</xref> article contained two studies (i.e., Studies 1 and 2). Although the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">Lazarus (1993)</xref> article also described two studies (i.e., Study 1 with high school students with LD or EBD and Study 2 with college students with LD), Study 1 was retained, but Study 2 was omitted because it used college students. Hence, for future reference, Study 1 that involved high school students with disabilities will be referred to as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">Lazarus (1993)</xref>. Of the nine studies, a total of 122 students were identified as having a disability. From this sample, 79 students (64.75%) had LD; 30 students (24.59%) had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); 8 students (6.56%) had EBD; 4 students (3.28%) had cognitive impairments (CI); and 1 student (0.82%) was identified as developmentally delayed (DD). In addition, 3 students without disabilities were also reported in the samples from the studies, with 2 students identified as English as a second language (ESL) and 1 student who had no disability (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731948711435794">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731948711435794">2</xref> in the “Results” section for each specific disability type per study). In seven of the nine studies in which gender was described, 75.5% of participants were male and 24.5% were female. In those studies that described the ethnicity of participants, 67.8% were European Americans, 19.3% were African Americans, 7.2% were Hispanic Americans, and 4.8% were Asian Americans. In six of the nine studies that reported intelligence scores, the average IQ score of all participants was 101.7. In the remaining three studies that did not report individual IQ scores of the participants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton et al. (2000)</xref> reported that IQ scores ranged from 81 to 119 for the 7 participants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus (1991</xref>) described the intelligence of the 6 participants with LD as being <italic>within the average range</italic>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711435794">Sweeney et al. (1999)</xref> did not report intelligence of the 3 participants in their study.</p>

<title>Note-Taking Interventions for Students With LD and High-Incidence Disabilities</title>
<p>In regards to the type of note-taking interventions used with students with disabilities, five studies used guided notes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711435794">Patterson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711435794">Sweeney et al., 1999</xref>), two studies used strategic note-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>), and two studies used directed note-taking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>). <italic>Guided notes</italic> are teacher-prepared outlines of the lecture that are meant to <italic>guide</italic> students through the lecture. Guided notes provide students with an outline of the content from the lecture and contain designated spaces for students to record more detailed information about specific lecture points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton, et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>). Researchers used several slightly different versions of guided notes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711435794">Sweeney et al. (1999)</xref> created two versions of guided notes called <italic>short-form guided notes</italic> and <italic>long-form guided notes</italic>. Both forms used a cloze procedure in which the guided notes were missing essential words (i.e., student were provided with a blank space) that students would fill in as the teacher lectured. The short form was missing one to three essential words from the lecture and the long form was missing four to eight words. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711435794">Patterson (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton et al. (2000)</xref> used a format that was a combination of the aforementioned long and short form. Finally, the format for guided notes developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">1993</xref>) resembled more of a traditional outline that used roman numerals and uppercase letters, along with words or questions that corresponded to the lecture. Again, students were to fill in blanks or missing words with information from the lecture.</p>
<p>Although guided notes were developed using actual lecture content (i.e., content-specific notes that use words from lecture points to cue students to record notes), strategic note-taking provided students with cognitive prompts and cues (e.g., record three to six main lecture points, record new vocabulary, summarize lecture points) to assist them during note-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>). Strategic note-taking paper was used with different lecture topics and, most recently, was used in conjunction with the CUES strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010b</xref>) for students with LD. During the lecture, students used the prompts from the strategic note-taking paper to record notes from the lecture. For example, under the heading <italic>Name three to six new main points with details as they are being discussed</italic>, students recorded three to six lecture points; under the heading <italic>New vocabulary or terms</italic>, students recorded vocabulary words from that section of the lecture; and under the heading <italic>Summary—Quickly describe how the ideas are related</italic>, students summarized the three to six lecture points. These prompts were repeated on several more pages until the lecture ended. On the last page of the strategic note-taking paper under the written prompt <italic>Write five important lecture points and describe the details of each lecture point</italic>, students wrote down five important lecture points. The components of the CUES strategy consisted of the following: <italic>Cluster</italic> step was used to prompt students to record three to six ideas on the strategic note-taking paper; the <italic>Use</italic> step prompted students to listen for teacher cues (i.e., number cues and importance cues) and on hearing these cues, record the lecture points that were associated with the cues; the <italic>Enter</italic> step prompted students to enter vocabulary words in their notes; and the <italic>Summarize</italic> step prompted students to write a word or words that would categorize the three to six lecture points that they had listed (i.e., clustered together) in their notes.</p>
<p>Finally, the directed note-taking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0731948711435794">Spires &amp; Stone, 1989</xref>) involved embedding note-taking skills within lectures and slowly teaching these note-taking skills to students over time (e.g., 3–6 weeks). Directed note-taking incorporated the following three components: the split-page format for recording notes; the use of self-questions for students to use before, during, and after the lecture; and explicit strategy instruction through teacher modeling, guided practice, and independent practice. In the split-page method, the left column was used for main concepts of the lecture and the right column was used for recording definitions, details, and examples as they are related to the main concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0731948711435794">Spires &amp; Stone, 1989</xref>). During the lecture, “the teacher explained the rationale for each note as he or she presented it in the context of the lecture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>, p. 3).</p>

<title>Note-taking intervention instruction</title>
<p>The average length of note-taking training per study was approximately two sessions (range = 1–3 sessions), except for the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al. (1994–1995)</xref> study, in which training sessions were 3 weeks in length. The note-taking training varied depending on the technique and researcher. In the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">1993</xref>), students with LD were taught over three consecutive periods by their classroom teacher (science or history teacher). During the first training session, students were taught to recognize main ideas and key terms. The teacher reviewed these on a transparency, and students learned to differentiate between them. During the second training session, students completed guided notes as they listened to two 10-min audiotaped lectures. During the third training session, the teacher lectured using notes recorded on transparencies, as students completed their own guided notes. When finished, guided notes were evaluated and students were provided with reinforcement and corrective feedback. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711435794">Patterson (2005)</xref> reported that she instructed students with LD and EBD how to complete guided notes, provided them time to practice using guided notes, and once students demonstrated proficiency, provided them with guided notes to use during lectures. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton et al. (2000)</xref> taught students with LD to complete guided notes during one class period; when students demonstrated proficiency, they provided students with guided notes to use in the remaining sessions. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711435794">Sweeney et al. (1999)</xref> did not describe training procedures; instead, prior to students’ use of guided notes (i.e., long and short form), students were simply instructed to <italic>fill in the blanks</italic> with words from the overhead transparency.</p>
<p>In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle and Weishaar (2001)</xref> study, students with LD and CI were taught to use strategic note-taking. During the first session, the researcher described and modeled how to use strategic note-taking while playing a videotaped training lecture. During the training, the researcher periodically stopped the lecture to check students’ notes and provided feedback. During the second session, students were shown the same videotaped lecture and recorded notes using new strategic note-taking paper; however, during the second session, the videotape was played in its entirety to acclimate students to the pace of a typical lecture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle (2010b)</xref> not only taught students with LD in a similar manner but also integrated the previously mentioned CUES strategic note-taking strategy into the training sessions.</p>
<p>In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al. (1994–1995)</xref> study, students with ADHD were taught directed note-taking. In Study 1, during the 1st week, the teacher presented notes on an overhead and students recorded notes in their usual manner. During the 2nd and 3rd weeks, the teacher began using directed note-taking with students. As notes were presented on the overhead, the teacher (a) explained why some notes were main ideas and others were details and (b) told students to record the notes “exactly as they appeared on the overhead” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>, p. 5). During the 4th week, the teacher interrupted the lecture and asked students to generate their own ideas for notes. These notes were written on the transparency by the teacher and recorded in their notebooks by the students. During the 5th week, the teacher discussed the main ideas of lecture but only recorded details on the overhead transparency for students to record. In Week 6 of the training, the teacher discussed and wrote down only the main ideas for students to record and discussed the details of these ideas (but did not record them on the transparency). In the 7th week, the teacher did not write down any notes and instead only answered questions about notes. This instruction was followed by 1 week of training during which the students were assessed on their ability to record notes independently. In Study 2, the authors used the same training procedures but condensed them from 6 weeks to 3 weeks.</p>

It is interesting to note that in the one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton et al., 2000</xref>) in which guided notes had the lowest/least effect (i.e., PND) on quiz scores, students were taught in only one session.</p>

<sec id="section15-0731948711435794">
<title>Review of notes</title>
<p>Seven of the nine studies incorporated a review or study session, typically 10 min in length, as part of its note-taking procedures. Studies that used guided notes with study or review sessions often found a gain in achievement when students studied/reviewed notes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">1993</xref>). For example, when a 10-min review period was incorporated in the study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus (1991)</xref> found an average 24% gain in test scores than when students with LD used guided notes alone. Similarly, in a second study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">Lazarus (1993)</xref> found an average increase of 24% in the portion of the study when students with LD used a 10-min review compared with when students used guided notes without a review. Although guided notes with study/review sessions produced an increase in achievement scores, directed note-taking that incorporated the use of a study hall period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>) produced only slight increases (e.g., 4% increase in study hall assignments scores when students used notes in study hall).</p>

<title>Design and measures</title>
<p>Of the nine studies, five were single-subject design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711435794">Patterson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711435794">Sweeney et al., 1999</xref>), two used a single-group design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>, Studies 1 and 2), and two were experimental group design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010b</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although every study assessed student performance using teacher-made tests or quizzes (measures varied from 10 to 30 items in length), the type of questions that were used varied from measure to measure. A consideration of the type of questions used is important because previous research has found that the effects of note-taking differ on recognition tests (e.g., multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank) compared with free recall tests (e.g., essay), with students who recorded notes exhibiting slightly larger ESs on free recall measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948711435794">Kobayashi, 2005</xref>). The belief is that a recognition test provides lots of retrieval cues that make it easier for non–note-takers to retrieve the correct information, thus reducing the difference in scores between note-takers and non–note-takers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731948711435794">Craik &amp; Tulving, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948711435794">Kahana, 1996</xref>). Six of the nine studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711435794">Patterson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711435794">Sweeney et al., 1999</xref>) used multiple-choice questions as part of their assessment. The other types of test/quiz questions included fill-in-the-blank, true/false, matching, and short answer, although the exact number of each type was not described in several of the studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711435794">Patterson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711435794">Sweeney et al., 1999</xref>). In addition to teacher-made tests or quizzes, other achievement measures that were administered to students included both immediate free recall and long-term free recall measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, in seven of the studies, researchers assessed either the quality (i.e., accuracy) or quantity of students’ notes (i.e., number of words or lecture points; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711435794">Patterson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711435794">Sweeney et al., 1999</xref>).

In Study 1, the authors listed quiz scores and assignments scores as dependent variables; however, they did not include these scores as part of their analysis because they felt that “there were too many factors (e.g., time) that may have contributed to changes in these measures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>, p. 8). In Study 2, the researchers incorporated four conditions:</p>

<p>Because this was a single-group design study, students served as their own controls. The outcomes were assessed through a quiz score (20-item quiz) and a study hall assignment score (15-item assignment). According to the authors of the study, of the quiz score and study hall assignments, the note-taking intervention (Treatments 1 and 3 conditions) was statistically significant for only study hall assignments. Furthermore, average assignment scores were higher when students either took notes using directed note-taking or used notes in the study hall. In our analysis, for the two comparisons dealing with note-taking and assignment scores, we found ESs of 0.37 when students used directed note-taking but did not use those notes in study hall, and 0.54 when students used directed note-taking and used notes in study hall.</p>

ES for this comparison was 0.82 for test scores, indicating a large ES. For the recall measures, these authors reported that treatment students who used strategic note-taking exhibited higher scores than students in the control group.

The authors of the study concluded that students did indeed record <italic>main ideas</italic> during the posttest phase but did not record them as main ideas using the note-taking’s format. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle and Weishaar (2001)</xref> reported that high school students with LD and CI in the treatment group who used strategic note-taking recorded approximately 175 words in their notes, compared with students in the control group, who recorded 62 words, illustrating a large ES (3.06). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle (2010b)</xref> reported that middle school students with LD who used strategic note-taking recorded an average of 108 words in notes compared with students with LD, who used conventional note-taking and recorded an average of 41 words (ES = 1.53).</p>

<title>Effects on other measures</title>
<p>In addition to examining the effects of note-taking interventions on measures of accuracy, quantity, comprehension, and recall, researchers also examined the effects on rates of on-task and disruptive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>), vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>), and different types of lecture points (e.g., cued and total lecture points) recorded by students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al. (1994–1995)</xref> reported that the better the quality of notes (e.g., more details, clarity, legibility, sequencing), the more likely students were to be on-task and the less likely to exhibit disruptive behavior. These researchers also found some modest positive correlations between note-taking and other variables, including details in notes and on-task rates (.47) and quality of notes and on-task rates (.42). Conversely, they found an inverse relationship between the quality of notes and disruptive behavior (−.41). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle and Weishaar (2001)</xref> examined vocabulary to determine whether students’ notes were associated with lecture content or recording unrelated words. The results of this portion of their study mirrored the findings from the total word count, and the authors reported that students who used strategic note-taking outperformed students who used conventional note-taking on both recall measures, as well as total vocabulary recorded in notes. Last, as far as the type of lecture points recorded and recalled, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle (2010b)</xref> found that students who used strategic note-taking recorded more cued lecture points and that overall, these students recorded more total lecture points in notes. Moreover, students also recalled more cued lecture points on immediate and long-term recall measures.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In general, the results indicated that students with LD and other disabilities who were taught to use note-taking techniques performed better on tests and quizzes (i.e., than using conventional note-taking), with the majority of studies showing <italic>very effective</italic> results or <italic>medium to large</italic> ESs on these measures. Of the three techniques (i.e., guided notes, strategic note-taking, and directed note-taking activity), guided notes and strategic note-taking were effective, as evidenced by PND or ES, at increasing student achievement on tests and quizzes, with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton et al. (2000)</xref> single-subject design study being the exception. Directed note-taking, however, was effective only with assignments scores. In addition, teaching note-taking techniques increased the accuracy of notes for students with developmental delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711435794">Sweeney et al., 1999</xref>, had an average 92% PND), increased the number of words recorded in notes for students with LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010b</xref>, ES = 1.53; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>, ES = 3.06), and increased the number of details recorded in notes for students with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>, ES = 1.02). Finally, note-taking interventions helped students with LD to record more key lecture points in notes and, in turn, recall more key lecture points on measures of immediate and long-term recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>Although note-taking techniques were effective for the majority of studies, only two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">1993</xref>) assessed and documented the effects of a review session on comprehension. As mentioned previously, the use of review sessions increased quiz scores when compared with guided-notes-only sessions. These studies corroborate the results of other studies that found large ESs (ES = 0.75 and 0.77; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948711435794">Kobayashi, 2005</xref>) for the effects of note-taking plus review sessions strategy on comprehension among students without disabilities.</p>
<sec id="section22-0731948711435794">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There were several limitations to this synthesis. First, the small numbers of research-based studies that we were able to locate limits the generalization of note-taking techniques for students with disabilities. Relatedly, the small number of studies also makes it difficult to say which note-taking technique is most effective. Including other studies, such as dissertations or ERIC documents (e.g., papers presented at conferences), might have increased the size of our analysis. A second limitation is the small number of students with certain types of disabilities included in our synthesis. Although the majority of students were those with LD, generalizing to students with other types of disabilities is cautioned because of the small number of disability types (i.e., eight students with EBD, four students with CIs) included in this synthesis.</p>

<sec id="section23-0731948711435794">
<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>Future research should examine the effects of popular but untested forms of note-taking, such as Cornell notes (e.g., split page), mapping notes, and matrix notes. Although some of these types have been examined with students in general education during lectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948711435794">Palmatier, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948711435794">Risch &amp; Kiewra, 1990</xref>), they remain untested among students with disabilities. In addition, future research should examine the effects of different types of note-taking interventions with different question types and learning tasks. For example, are certain types of note-taking more effective on application types of questions or essay questions? In addition, student note-taking interventions should compare providing students with the teacher’s complete notes during the lecture with providing them after the lecture for later review to see which is more effective on achievement measures. Finally, it is still unclear whether students who use guided notes (a) actually learn note-taking skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>) and (b) can become autonomous learners once the teacher stops providing them with guided notes. Likewise, the generalization of other techniques (i.e., strategic note-taking and directed note-taking) has yet to be demonstrated. Future studies should examine how well these techniques generalize to inclusive or general education classrooms.</p>

<title>Implications for the Classroom</title>
<p>The note-taking techniques mentioned in this synthesis provide teachers of students with LD with note-taking interventions to use in content-area classroom lectures. What the synthesis highlights is that when teaching students to use note-taking interventions, teachers should use explicit and direct instruction that includes modeling, guided practice, and independent practice. These procedures were used throughout the studies and appeared to be crucial for teaching students with LD and other disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711435794">Patterson, 2005</xref>). In these studies, researchers/teachers used two to three sessions to instruct students how to use note-taking procedures, during which they reviewed the note-taking form (e.g., guided notes, strategic note-taking paper) and important components of note-taking (e.g., recording main ideas, important terms or vocabulary, teacher cued notes), modeled how to record notes using the form, and provided students with opportunities to use the note-taking form during lectures that included feedback and reinforcement for correctly recording notes using the form (e.g., guided notes, strategic note-taking). Because the teacher would want to model the proper use of note-taking, a videotaped or audiotaped lecture, similar to a typical classroom lecture, might be useful during training sessions, as was done in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">1993</xref>). Using a videotaped lecture, the teacher can periodically stop, check notes, and provide students with feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, the teacher could replay portions of the lecture that students failed to record, particularly those sections of the lecture that contain important information (i.e., cued lecture points) that students should have recorded in their notes. Finally, once students are proficient with the note-taking technique, a videotaped lecture from content classes could help students become acclimated to the pace of lectures in their actual classes, as was illustrated in those studies including students with LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The specific skills that students with LD should learn include listening for and grouping together similar lecture points or main ideas, recording important vocabulary with definitions, discerning between important and unimportant lecture points, recognizing lecture cues used by teachers (i.e., these may vary from teacher to teacher), using abbreviations and a common rule for abbreviating long words, and keeping notes in an organized format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711435794">Boyle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711435794">Boyle &amp; Weishaar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711435794">Evans et al., 1994–1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711435794">Hamilton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731948711435794">Hughes &amp; Suritsky, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711435794">Lazarus, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711435794">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711435794">Patterson, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Students with LD should begin learning note-taking skills in upper elementary grades as teachers can show them the advantages of writing down and recording important information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731948711435794">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). It is particularly important that students with LD learn how to record notes in middle and high school, where lectures become a common format used by teachers during class instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948711435794">Olson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0731948711435794">Putnam et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, because a large number of students with LD and other mild disabilities will be attending postsecondary institutions, where lectures are used on almost a daily basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731948711435794">Brobst, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948711435794">Newman, Wagner, Cameto, &amp; Knokey, 2009</xref>), these students must learn effective note-taking skills. For students with LD, note-taking is a critical learning tool that is commonly used in classes from elementary school through college, for a variety of tasks (i.e., from research papers to class discussions), and by individuals throughout their lifetime.</p>
