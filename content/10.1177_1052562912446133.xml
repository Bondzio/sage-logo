<title>Conference Theme</title>
<p><bold>Sustainability:</bold> Sustaining Ourselves, Students, Community, and Global World</p>
<p>When we speak of sustainability, we often think of “green” or the environment these days, but truthfully, sustainability is all around us and impacts us daily at multiple levels, so much so that we often are not mindful of it when we act. If innovation fuels our fire, then sustainability ensures that fire continues to burn. How often do we engage in a new venture only to find that it is short-lived and its full potential is not achievable? In times of economic downturns and turbulence, we need to ask ourselves at what cost do we try to maintain our way of life? We as educators need to continuously ask ourselves how is it possible to sustain our passion for learning and teaching when a new idea can get old pretty quickly? How can we sustain our enthusiasm for teaching when we are bombarded with potential constraints or obstacles?</p>
<p>Often the concept of sustainability goes unrecognized and untapped, due to our own oversight or lack of deep thinking. In this conference, we encourage participants to engage in an ongoing dialogue that has the potential to allow each of us to exchange new ideas, approaches, awareness, and practices to enhance our lives and our work.</p>

<title>Conference Site</title>
<p><bold>Brock University, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada</bold></p>
<p>Brock University is well equipped, ready, and eager to host OBTC in June 2012. With over 17,000 full-time students and nearly 600 faculty, we’re small enough to be intimate and big enough to be world-class and in demand among international students. Brock University is known for its commitment to teaching and learning from both sides of the brain! Our campus and conference facilities are numerous, enabling all conference activities and accommodations to be located on-site. In addition, Brock University is located in the Niagara Region, a premier tourism destination in Canada with an abundance of exciting attractions to ensure an enjoyable visit. The region has established a long history of meeting tourist and conference delegates’ needs. Our university is one hour (and a border crossing) away from the Buffalo International Airport and 1.5 hours from the Lester B. Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Ontario. We’re easy to get to and worth the travel for the 2012 OBTC.</p>
