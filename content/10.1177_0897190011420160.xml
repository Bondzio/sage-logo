<abstract>
<p>Positive outcomes of antimicrobial stewardship programs in the inpatient setting are well documented, but the benefits for patients not admitted to the hospital remain less clear. This report describes a retrospective case–control study of patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) with subsequent positive cultures conducted to determine whether integrating antimicrobial stewardship responsibilities into practice of the emergency medicine clinical pharmacist (EPh) decreased times to positive culture follow-up, patient or primary care provider (PCP) notification, and appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy. Pre- and post-implementation groups of an EPh-managed antimicrobial stewardship program were compared. Positive cultures were identified in 177 patients, 104 and 73 in pre- and post-implementation groups, respectively. Median time to culture review in the pre-implementation group was 3 days (range 1-15) and 2 days (range 0-4) in the post-implementation group (<italic>P</italic> = .0001). There were 74 (71.2%) and 36 (49.3%) positive cultures that required notification in the pre- and post-implementation groups, respectively, and the median time to patient or PCP notification was 3 days (range 1-9) and 2 days (range 0-4) in the 2 groups (<italic>P</italic> = .01). No difference was seen in the appropriateness of therapy. In conclusion, EPh involvement reduced time to positive culture review and time to patient or PCP notification when indicated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multidrug resistant pathogens are a growing concern when treating nosocomial and community-associated infections.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011420160">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011420160"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011420160">3</xref>
</sup> These resistant organisms are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011420160">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011420160"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011420160">3</xref>
</sup> Antimicrobial stewardship programs are a method that can be used to control the rise in resistance and improve the quality of patient care. In addition, inappropriate empiric antibiotic therapy may lead to readmission to the hospital and complications for the patient, secondary to infection. The incorporation of a clinical pharmacist with training in infectious diseases on an antimicrobial stewardship service is supported by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America in their 2007 antimicrobial stewardship guidelines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011420160">1</xref>
</sup> It is stated that pharmacists play a crucial role in antimicrobial stewardship as they are knowledgeable on the appropriate use of antimicrobials, dosing, and drug interactions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011420160">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>One area with a growing pharmacy presence is the emergency department (ED). Recently, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) issued a draft statement on the role of pharmacists in the ED stating that “pharmacists are integral to the provision of interdisciplinary patient care services. A wide variety of services can be provided by pharmacists in this practice setting, and these include providing essential patient care, managing medication services, patient and health care provider education, contributing to quality improvement initiatives, and participating in research.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011420160">4</xref>
</sup> Research has shown that pharmacists play an important role in the ED, but there is a need for data supporting this in specific patient outcomes as the majority of the literature addresses adverse drug event prevention and cost containment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011420160">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011420160"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011420160"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011420160">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Therefore, a logical expansion of services provided by the emergency medicine clinical pharmacist (EPh) is the involvement in antimicrobial stewardship activities. However, this has not been extensively studied and consequently limited data are available. A previous report described a pharmacist-managed antimicrobial stewardship program from the ED; however, to date, limited data are available on the effect of such a program.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011420160">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190011420160">10</xref>
</sup> Wymore et al from the Saint Joseph Medical Center (SJMC) reported success with their program. At SJMC, the EPh reviewed cultures for sexually transmitted diseases, skin and soft tissue structures, and urinary tract, blood, and respiratory infections on a daily basis. While reviewing the positive cultures, the pharmacists assessed whether patients received appropriate treatment based on the culture and susceptibility results. Pharmacists then consulted with the emergency medicine physicians to discuss their findings. Patients were contacted if alterations to their antimicrobial therapy were necessary and arrangements were made for patients to obtain new prescriptions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011420160">9</xref>
</sup> Randolph et al compared 1 year of physician-managed cultures (n = 2,278) with 1 year of pharmacist-managed cultures (n = 2,361) in the ED setting. This retrospective review revealed that EPh made more antimicrobial regimen modifications and reduced the rate of unplanned admissions in 96 hours of initial culture review and allergic reactions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190011420160">10</xref>
</sup> This study differs from the one conducted by Randolph et al as the authors compared the time to culture review.</p>
<p>In response to provider demand, a similar program in our ED was launched. There are currently limited data that support the clinical impact for this novel role of the EPh. An aspect that has not been previously evaluated is the impact of time to culture review and change in therapy or provider notification. There is data in the inpatient setting that reveal time to appropriate antibiotics does play a role in patient outcomes.<sup>

</sup> The purpose of this investigation was to compare the number of days to culture follow-up and patient or provider notification and appropriate antimicrobial therapy before and after an EPh-managed antimicrobial stewardship program.</p>

<title>Methods</title>

<title>Setting</title>
<p>This study was conducted at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), a university teaching hospital providing emergency services with over 97 000 visits per year. Prior to EPh involvement, the emergency medicine midlevel providers (MLPs), nurse practitioners, and physician assistants were responsible during their clinical shifts for antimicrobial culture and susceptibility report follow-up for patients who were previously discharged directly from the ED. Owing to high daily patient volume, routine screening of culture reports often fell to the end of the daily task list and was identified by the MLPs as an area needing improvement. The EPh was requested to assist in this process, given their role in ensuring appropriateness of medication therapies in the ED and knowledge of antimicrobial therapy through PharmD curriculum and advanced residency training. An EPh-managed antimicrobial stewardship program in the ED commenced in October 2008.</p>
<p>EPh involvement had 2 key components: education regarding appropriate empiric antimicrobial selection and assistance with follow-up to identify patients where a change in therapy was required. The educational component involved didactic lectures and preparation of clinical resources to be used when the EPh was unavailable. The active surveillance component was incorporated into daily activities of the EPh beginning October 1, 2008 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190011420160">Figure 1</xref>
). It is important to note that the steps in the process did not change, but some of the responsibilities were transitioned to the EPh. The workflow for the process was based on a daily set of culture reports generated by the microbiology laboratory at 3:00 <sc>am</sc>. The system relies on overnight staff collating necessary clinical information (pulling the chart, etc) for review and follow-up during the day shift. The EPh assumed the responsibility of reviewing these culture results and providing necessary follow-up. All of the positive culture results were logged into the adult ED culture database along with any interventions that were performed (eg, patient or primary care provider [PCP] notification via telephone or letter, prescription called into a pharmacy for the patient, etc). The EPhs discussed their plan with the MLPs who would have performed a prior culture follow-up, as this group wanted to remain involved in the process. This was a dedicated activity that occurred during normal business hours when follow-up contact is more practical. In addition to culture review, the EPh assumed responsibility for all telephone reports (from the microbiology laboratory as well as follow-up calls from patients and providers). It was estimated that the additional work load for the EPh was somewhere between 1.5 and 3 hours daily.</p>

<sec id="section4-0897190011420160">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>In order to assess the impact of the EPh-managed antimicrobial stewardship program, a retrospective cohort of all adult patients that were discharged from the ED with subsequent positive culture results between 2 time periods were evaluated. Pre-implementation was the time period of November 2007 through January 2008 and post-implementation of an EPh-managed program was from November 2008 through January 2009.</p>
<p>Patients were identified, retrospectively, from the ED antimicrobial culture and susceptibility follow-up database that was maintained by the MLPs and EPhs. All patients from the pre- and post-implementation time periods, who were &gt; 18 years and had a reported positive culture after discharge from the ED were included in the analysis. This included patients who were transferred to another institution or admitted to the 24-hour observational unit. Patients who were admitted to an inpatient service were excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0897190011420160">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Prior to initiation of data collection, approval was obtained from the URMC research subjects review board. A complete culture database and medical record review was conducted by one abstractor using a standardized abstraction form and code book to gather cultures drawn, culture results including susceptibility data, empiric antimicrobial selection and changes made to therapy following discharge, time to positive culture review, time to patient or PCP notification, and time to appropriate antibiotic therapy based on final culture results. The time to positive culture review was defined as the time from patient presentation to the ED, utilizing documented triage date, to the first time the positive culture was reviewed. The time of review was documented in the culture database as a date without a time. Therefore, the results are reported in days.</p>
<p>Antimicrobial therapy was deemed inappropriate by the data abstractor if (1) the empiric antibiotic prescribed to the patient would not treat the presumed/documented pathogen based on the reported spectrum of activity, (2) empiric recommendation was inconsistent with IDSA or local guidelines for the patient’s infectious process, or (3) local data implies that the initial therapy was inappropriate (eg, institution-specific antibiogram). However, once positive culture results and susceptibilities were final, antimicrobial therapy was assessed based on this information in combination with the clinical indication for therapy and susceptibility results for the identified pathogen, when available. Appropriateness during culture review was determined by the EPh. For those that were more complex, the infectious diseases clinical pharmacy specialist was consulted. If needed, the infectious diseases fellows and attendings were available to discuss complicated patient cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0897190011420160">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The primary end points of time to positive culture review as well as time to patient or PCP notification were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The secondary end points of appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy as empiric and definitive treatment were presented as categorical data and compared using the χ<sup>2</sup> analysis or Fisher exact test where appropriate.</p>
<p>A target sample size was calculated using PS Software Version 3.0 (Power and Sample Size Calculations). At a desired alpha of .05 and power of 0.8, a sample size of 200 patients for each study group was calculated to be adequate to detect a reduction of ≥30% in time to positive culture review.</p>

<sec id="section7-0897190011420160">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 212 patients with subsequent positive cultures were identified during the study period, 132 in the pre-implementation group (November 2007 to January 2008) and 80 in the post-implementation group (November 2008 to January 2009). A total of 28 patients in the pre-implementation group and 7 patients in the post-implementation group were excluded due to subsequent hospital admission, resulting in 104 in the pre-implementation and 73 in the post-implementation groups.</p>
<p>Baseline demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190011420160">Table 1</xref>
). However, positive urine cultures were more common among those in the pre-implementation group (<italic>P</italic> = .05), whereas the post-implementation group had more positive skin and soft tissue cultures (<italic>P</italic> = .03).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Antimicrobial agents are commonly prescribed to patients who are discharged from the ED. However, there is often limited or inconsistent follow-up of culture results to systematically ensure appropriate therapy. Given the previous success of pharmacy-managed antimicrobial stewardship programs in the inpatient setting, it is logical to consider the integration of ED-based stewardship into the practice of the EPh. This retrospective case–control study with a historical control group was designed to evaluate the impact of the dedicated EPh on the time to positive culture review and patient or provider notification for patients discharged from a busy ED at an academic medical center. We found that an EPh-managed program decreased both time to positive culture review and time to patient or PCP notification when indicated. Although our study was not able to specifically evaluate the clinical outcome associated with delays in appropriate antimicrobial therapy, there is evidence in the inpatient setting that these delays are associated with worse clinical outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190011420160">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190011420160"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190011420160">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>During the pre-implementation period, the MLPs prioritized their tasks based on the ED patient census; so, when the ED was busy, the review of the positive culture and susceptibility information were often delayed until later in the day or several days later. Since the MLPs did not have control over the ED patient census or the number of positive culture and susceptibility reports, systematic and timely follow-up was inconsistent. The EPh is ideally positioned to maintain the task as a high priority and has the knowledge and skills necessary to manage the culture results. EPhs have different clinical backgrounds, as not all who currently practice in the ED have completed a second year specialty residency in emergency medicine. However, most practitioners have completed at least a postgraduate year one residency, where they received more training in infectious diseases, and others have completed a second year specialty residency in other specialties such as ambulatory care, critical care, infectious diseases, and so on.</p>
<p>There are limitations to our study that need to be considered. First of all, the MLP only documented the culture follow-up times in days, so we were only able to analyze the time data in days and not hours as we would have liked. In addition, during the post-implementation time period, the microbiology culture report was incomplete as certain types of cultures did not print for several days due to technological issues. The EPh collaborated with the microbiology laboratory and information technology services to remedy this issue, but this had a negative impact on the sample size for the post-implementation group and limited our power to detect a meaningful difference. There was also a difference in the site of the positive cultures in the 2 patient groups. We intentionally selected the same months for pre- and post-implementation cohorts to account for seasonal variation in infectious processes and believe these differences are due to chance. The time to growth and reporting of both urine and skin and soft tissue infections is generally 2 days at our institution and there are well-developed empiric treatment guidelines for these infections, making them reasonable infections to compare. In addition, no new assays or techniques were implemented by the microbiology laboratory between the 2 periods of study that would have altered turnaround time in culture results. We do not feel that this difference in the patient groups impacted the time-dependent end points.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that the EPh at our institution is available Monday through Friday from 11:00 <sc>am</sc> to 7:00 <sc>pm</sc>, so the MLPs are still responsible for culture follow-up on the weekends. This is reflected in the time-dependent end points in the post-implementation group, where the range was reported up to 4 days. Cultures that printed Saturday at 03:00 <sc>am</sc> may not have been reviewed until Monday at 11:00 <sc>am</sc> if the MLPs were unavailable for review. Finally, based on the design of the ED antimicrobial stewardship program, we currently only capture patients with subsequent positive cultures following discharge from the ED and not all patients that have received treatment with antibiotics. Based on the current model, we are unable to address the discontinuation of unnecessary antimicrobial therapy or optimization of therapy for patients who are prescribed broad-spectrum agents that may not be necessary. This is an initiative that we plan on implementing in the future. Finally, we were unable to assess the efficacy and adherence to antimicrobial regimens.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>An EPh-managed antimicrobial stewardship program significantly reduced time to positive culture review and time to patient or PCP notification when indicated. Further study is necessary to determine whether this impacts patient outcomes in the ED setting.</p>
