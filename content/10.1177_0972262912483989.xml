<p>This book is a timely contribution to current discourses on governance and local participation. It is the product of a research project on <italic>New Forms of Governance</italic> in Indian mega cities: decentralization, financial management and partnerships in urban environmental services, carried out by a team of Indian researchers led by Professor Amitabh Kundu at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, Professor I.S.A. Baud of the University of Amsterdam and Dr Joop de Wit of the Institute of Social Studies in the Hague. The project was carried out between 2003 and 2006 as part of a long term Indo-Dutch Research Programme on Alternatives in Development. The book describes emerging trends in local urban governance and their implications for local power structure and governance processes in Indian cities.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, several factors have led to paradigmatic shifts in how governance is conceptualized and governance processes are articulated. These include notably changing configurations around the state in governance, increasing role of non-state actors such as NGOs, civil society groups and bilateral and multilateral organizations. Governance processes, so to say, have become more globalized as the locus of control for policy-making has shifted beyond the state boundaries. At the same time, we see parallel trends towards decentralization; in the Indian case, for instance, through the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Constitution of India that seek to strengthen local governance both by urban and rural units of self-governance. What are the new challenges for governance that this increased thrust on decentralization presents in an era of globalization? The collection of articles in this book address these issues, while providing crucial pointers and directions for further research.</p>
<p>While discussing the evolution of governance structures and processes in the city of Mumbai, Pinto points to how the lack of coordination and city planning amidst a plethora of organizations has created environmental problems in the city. This results largely from a curious nexus between land mafia, builders, officials and politicians. Essentially, locals have colluded to form new forms of social capital in an era of globalization and new economic opportunities. J. de Wit, Nainan and Palnitkar provide a critical review of decentralized governance and its implications for large cities pointing to a discrepancy between the establishment of Wards Committees and their actual working. Ghosh and Mitra take this analysis a bit further while focusing on the case of West Bengal. They note several problems with their functioning; namely, limited gender inclusiveness, strong influence of local politics and financial problems. There is great variation in their functioning, noting a greater level of interest in poor and slum areas. Ninan and I.S.A. Baud, in their analysis of Wards Committees in Mumbai, note in a similar vein, that the relations between NGOs and councillors are based on suspicion and conflict. On the whole, the future of urban decentralization legislation does seem to be rather bleak, as the chapters in this section point out.</p>
<p>Governance has now come increasingly to be conceptualized in terms of the rising role of partnerships and new networks among non-state actors. This has indeed led to the widening of the gap between government and governance. Chapters in the second part of this book address the implications of this trend for urban governance. These chapters point to a wider variety of actors than usually thought of in the literature on local governance. They throw new light on the role of community-based organizations functioning as small scale enterprises and Resident Welfare Associations that have actively served to lobby for and protect the interests of the emerging middle class in the cities. Multi-actor arrangements have also come to play a role in ensuring accountability and transparency. While these arrangements have made some impact on improving accountability and transparency, a challenge remains in improving the reach of these services.</p>
<p>Chapters in the third section of the book point to emerging forms of contestation in local governance. A major form of contestation involves the increasing role of non-state actors in governance; such processes, the authors of the contributions note, do not proceed smoothly with a wide gap between intent and practice. The contributions suggest that state and local city governments show resistance at allowing residents a greater say in determining urban affairs as there seems to be some fear that localized issues may hijack the interests of the city as a whole. They call for efforts at reconciling local with city interests. Another level of contestation is between the burgeoning middle class and the urban poor; the latter enjoy most of the goods and services that are produced by the former and have found an important ally in the judiciary for protecting and furthering their interests. Emerging regulatory frameworks seem to favour the elite, while further dispossessing the poor and marginalized.</p>
<p>On the whole, the book makes for a very good read. The insights are both timely and critical. They raise important questions not only about the changing nature of local governance, but more importantly about issues of equity and justice in the changing governance regime. The overall message of the contributions is that new alliances and networks are getting forged in an era of globalized governance. The emergence of new actors as players in governance has not only created new equations and power relations, but also raises questions about equity and justice in emerging cities. While cities—as the editors remark in the opening chapter—are associated with certain benefits such as those that accrue from economies of scale and from concentration, they bring in their wake both social and environmental challenges that conventional governance structures have been ill-equipped to handle. Institutional innovation has brought in several changes but its benefits need to be much more diffused.</p>
<p>The chapters in the collection also provide pointers to future research, much of which would have to revolve around the equity and justice implications of new trends in urban governance, the emerging forms of social capital that sustain these governance structure and the changing configurations between actors in real estate, politics, bureaucrats and civil society. However, one question that remains unaddressed is the validity of the concept of urban itself. With rapid urbanization, the spilling over of cities into the periphery and the consequent changes, the divide between rural and urban itself would tend to thin down over the coming years. This raises the conceptual question on whether ‘urban’ and ‘rural’ would still be recognizable and distinct zones in the future; and whether a rural–urban dichotomy in analyzing governance would still be relevant or appropriate. A research agenda for urban governance has to increasingly take cognizance of the linkages between the rural and the urban, the spilling over of the urban ecological foot-print into the peripheries and its relationship with the rural–urban dichotomy in development.</p>
