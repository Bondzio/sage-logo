<p>The book under review is a narration of success stories of hundred managers who worked tirelessly to achieve excellence sans flamboyance which is synonymous with success in today’s business. They are visionaries in their own right and laid solid foundations for growth of their respective organizations. These managers exemplified in terms of commitment and single minded devotion to strengthen the strategic architecture in terms of people and processes. People, the so called ordinary employees play a very significant role in accomplishing extraordinary task when guided in the right direction by their visionary superiors. The managers not only craft a realistic roadmap for the organization, but also inculcate a sense of meaningfulness among the subordinates by their thought and action. They dream big and put their dreams into reality by supplementing through concrete action. The organizations do not flourish in isolation, but through collective efforts of all the stakeholders where managers do act as catalysts for sustainable growth. The authors have rightly categorized managers into four categories: doers, achievers, visionaries and missionaries. The profiles which found a place in the book are the qualitative representations of four categories into a single format of achieving result through sustainable action. The cases in the first chapter are meticulously chosen to depict the vision and values of the managers who exemplified thought and action into reality. Some of the cases are from well known corporate while some others are from not so known entities though there is some incongruity of branding everybody as managers despite the fact that some of them are entrepreneurs of their own right.</p>
<p>Here I thought it appropriate to mention the name of Dr Ashok Agarwal whose profile has found a mention in the book. Dr Agarwal is a different breed of entrepreneur who believed in strengthening the social sector through management technology. He conceived the idea of facilitating health management education through IIHMR (Indian Institute of Health Management Research) by integrating domain knowledge and practice of management in a unique format which is appreciated globally. He could foresee not only the need of qualified doctors but also the huge requirement of professional managers in health sector in third world countries like India. His efforts have paid rich dividends for Indian health sector and also other third world countries in the neighbourhood as well. I am privileged to have interacted with him a couple of times and I admire his lofty vision and commitment to capacity building for a social cause. The inclusion of profiles like this is appropriate and laudatory on the part of authors for the benefit of readers.</p>
<p>The second and third chapters are closely interlinked. Strategy, planning and goal setting are closely linked to system’s thinking and efficient use of technology for sustainable advantage. Strategic orientation for superior result needs system’s thinking coupled with technological leadership. The managers devise strategies on the achievable parameters, keeping an eye on their core strengths. There are numerable instances of organizations carving a space for themselves through out of the box approach and efficient use of technology. The most important aspect of managerial excellence is generation of innovative ideas and actionable strategy for accomplishment. Technology serves as a tool for process improvement while strategy is invariably linked with business intelligence. Managers need to keep track of market dynamics, customer psychology, technological advancement and service delivery mechanism in setting goals, devising strategy and applying appropriate technological knowhow for operational efficiency. The authors did a commendable job by applying RSDQ (Roles, Styles, Delegations and Qualities) model for assessing managers on strategic orientation and application at work. The authors also rightly mentioned that system’s thinking and adoption of technologies are the areas which deserved a special focus in many organizations. The cases which are covered deserve admiration as the managers who introduce or manage technology are hardly recognized in management fraternity despite their toil and contribution to the organizational success story. Among all the cases mentioned, I found the story of Santharam and Titan Industries quite interesting particularly his involvement in Titan residential project for workers.</p>
<p>The chapters on inspiring, developing and empowering staff and culture building, discuss the transformational approaches of individual managers in creating an enabling environment to attain unprecedented success. Though systems, processes and technology serve as hardware for organizations, the people dimension which is essentially in organizational software cannot be ignored. The authors have clearly mentioned that competent and motivated staff unleashes their creative energies to make things happen. The managers play a crucial role in developing and empowering subordinates who in turn give their best to the organization. The managers should have the capacity to relate with the workers while understanding their need hierarchy level and sculpt an action plan to overcome the seemingly unwarranted issues. Coaching and mentoring serve as effective tool in developing employees to realize their utmost potential for superior performance at work. Culture building is another area which managers often neglect while limiting their roles to transactional activities. Managers need to devote sufficient time and energy to transform organizations into living bodies by infusing a sense of togetherness and pride. The cases of Angshu Mallick of Adani Wilmar and Mangesh Manohar Borkar are worth mentioning which may inspire the future managers particularly how despite ostensible odds, they could script success stories for their respective organizations.</p>
<p>Teamwork and management of colleagues are the parameters of success for managers. The organizations are essentially not isolated formations, but work within a complex web of teams which are intertwined with each other. The effectiveness of teams also rests on internal dynamics with the managerial style of team leader acts as moderating variable. Teams become dysfunctional in case the leader is not accepted wholeheartedly. The authors were candid in mentioning that the team building requires a sense of understanding and accommodation besides allocation of suitable team roles. The manager acts as a glue in keeping the team together and fostering a sense of oneness in achieving the desired objectives. Subordinate development is rather a very complex area which requires endless effort on the part of the managers not only in letters, but also in spirits. So far as my understanding goes in dealing with managers of various organizations, it is unfortunate to note that most of the cases are limited to paying lip services with obvious exceptions. The power dynamics often act as spoiler for harmony in the team and among colleagues. Mutual understanding, collaboration and respect for each other fosters a sense of collegiality. The authors tried to understand the relationship dynamics using tested questionnaire which was most probably used in selection of profiles for inclusion in the book.</p>
<p>Liaison with boss and top management is one of the critical areas which deserves due attention. The managerial roles are multi faceted, in one side working with the team and on the other side taking superiors into confidence. Sometimes managers do indulge in persuasive communication with seniors in order to get their issues resolved, at times also disagreement with the higher ups. This role demands highest form of maturity and resilience. Dealing with external customers is another area having wide ramifications for the organization. Good managers not only focus on strengthening internal capabilities but also maintain harmonious relationship with external customers/clients through effective service delivery mechanisms. The success or failure of any major initiative is largely dependent on the leadership style of the managers concerned. The various leadership styles which are normally found in management literature have certain degree of advantages as well as disadvantages. However, understanding the context is the single most important task for managers. The cases provide important lessons for readers; the most important one is dealing meticulously with present context with future outlook.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the book substantially lacks rigour in research. The introduction to the chapters is too short to serve as a knowledge base for deductive learning. The profiles seem to rely upon sources of the managers which deserved critical analysis. Marginal incongruity related to chapters and cases look apparent. Managers from few selected organizations are often repeated. The authors could have focused more on content with reduced the number of cases. Despite reservations on some aspects of the book, I am of the opinion that this book provides an interesting reading for present and future managers. The authors also deserve appreciation for their painstaking efforts in bringing some of the bright managers and their commendable work into limelight.</p>
