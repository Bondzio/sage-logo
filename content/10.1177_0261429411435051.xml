<abstract>
<p>This article examines whether giftedness is actually a gift for those who receive it. The following attributes of a true gift are described as: (1) an understanding of what the gift is and who owns it; (2) realizing that it needs maintenance; (3) knowing what to do with the gift; (4) the giver expects nothing in return; and (5) the receiver appreciates having the gift. Next, each attribute is related to empirical and theoretical work on giftedness. Finally, based on a synthesis of the previous sections, the question of whether giftedness really is a gift is answered and recommendations are made.</p>

<body>
<p>Gift giving is important in my family because it is how we acknowledge that we like each other. I enjoy giving gifts but I do not always choose wisely. One year I was particularly clueless and increasingly desperate about what to give to my father. I finally presented him with a wicker hatchet that supposedly contained a stone from an Aboriginal tribe in New Guinea. Sadly, my father was now stuck with something he did not particularly value. No store would be silly enough to take it back, plus he did not want to hurt my feelings. The hatchet was eventually hung on the wall of a back room where, with any luck, most people would not see it. This was certainly a questionable gift choice on my part, especially because every few days the stone would fall out.</p>
<p>When we label some children as gifted, are we saying that they have an indisputable gift? Their abilities can potentially allow them to have interesting and successful lives. They can learn quickly, feel intensely, understand complex concepts, make non-obvious connections, and have unique ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261429411435051">Lovecky, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261429411435051">Sayler, 2009</xref>). They also have the potential to benefit society in important ways through their productive and creative contributions. But what if, for some children, being gifted is not a gift at all? What if it is a burden, like the Aboriginal hatchet, and they wish they could return it?</p>
<p>This article explores whether giftedness meets the characteristics of a true gift. According to a variety of dictionary definitions, a genuine present has at least five attributes. The first is that we discover what the gift is and we know that it has been given to us. If we do not know exactly what we have received then the gift cannot be used wisely. The second is that we understand that it needs to be taken care of, at least to some extent. All gifts need some type of maintenance if they are going to last. Some, such as furniture, probably do not need a lot of care; other gifts, such as plants or pets, require a great deal of time and attention. In other words, all gifts fall somewhere on a continuum of care. The third attribute is that we know what to do with the gift. Does it come with an understandable users’ manual or set of instructions? Do we know how to get the most out of it? Attribute four is that the gift is given with no expectation of receiving something in return. True gifts come without any strings attached. Finally, a genuine gift is one we like and appreciate either immediately or over time. It suits us, perhaps because it makes life easier or we are proud to own it.</p>
<p>Each of these five attributes will be explored in relation to giftedness. The final part will synthesize the previous sections and resolve whether giftedness truly is a gift for those who receive it.</p>
<sec id="section1-0261429411435051">
<title>Attribute 1: The receiver knows what the gift is and that it is his or hers</title>
<p>Usually when we are given a gift we know what it is. If need be, we can ask someone or read the package. Unfortunately, if giftedness is a gift, it is not quite clear what it is. When I asked 71 college students what it means to be gifted, I received 64 different answers. Even though exceptional abilities have been acknowledged for centuries, there is still no universal agreement on what exactly it means for someone to be, or not to be, gifted. Currently there are several definitions of giftedness commonly in use and they vary on a number of important dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429411435051">Dai, 2009</xref>). </p>
<sec id="section2-0261429411435051">
<title>Defining giftedness</title>
<p>Some definitions focus on demonstrated achievement and expert performance (Ericsson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429411435051">2005</xref>). In other words, gifted children and adults display more outstanding, tangible accomplishments within a particular context or domain than their same-age peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429411435051">Dai, 2009</xref>). In contrast, other definitions focus on the likelihood of high levels of achievement in the future. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261429411435051">US Congress (1988</xref>), for example, gifted and talented children and adolescents show potential for high performance in the following areas: intellectual, leadership, creative, artistic, or any academic area. This particular definition also acknowledges that special services or activities need to be provided by the schools in order to fully develop this potential.</p>
<p>Other definitions de-emphasize achievement and aptitude by including non-intellective characteristics. For example, according to the Columbus Group (1991, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261429411435051">Morelock, 1996</xref>), giftedness is best described as asynchronous development. More specifically, gifted children’s highly developed cognitive abilities and keen intensity combine to create awareness and inner experiences that differ qualitatively from those of their same-age peers. Greater degrees of intellectual capacity result in greater asynchrony. Their uneven development causes gifted children to be vulnerable, and therefore to require special teaching, parenting, and counseling. In contrast, Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261429411435051">Renzulli (1986</xref>) focuses on behavior rather than the individual. According to his definition, ‘Gifted behavior consists of behaviors that reflect an interaction among three basic clusters of human traits – these clusters being above average general and/or specific abilities, high levels of task commitment, and high levels of creativity’ (p. 73).</p>
<p>Only a small representative sample of definitions has been presented here. There are numerous ones currently in use because they tend to vary by country, state, theory, and agenda. Therefore, it is not surprising that we do not fully understand why some individuals are identified as gifted during childhood but not in adulthood and vice versa. It is not even surprising that a child can be gifted in Oregon and have that gift taken away if her family moves to Georgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411435051">Borland, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The nature of giftedness was probably much more clear in the early 1920s when Lewis Terman defined it solely in terms of IQ scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261429411435051">Terman, 1925</xref>). Today, with so many different and complex definitions, giftedness can take a variety of forms. Some children are what Joe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411435051">Renzulli (2005</xref>) calls schoolhouse gifted and Ellen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411435051">Winner (1996</xref>) refers to as globally gifted. These children excel in a wide range of academic disciplines and tend to perform well in school. More common, and less understood, are children who demonstrate exceptional performance in one domain, while showing average or below-average ability in other ones. As noted earlier, children in the United States can be gifted or talented in any academic discipline, leadership capacity, or the performing or visual arts. A subset of this population can be ‘twice exceptional’ because they demonstrate high potential or achievement in one or more academic areas and are also diagnosed with a disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261429411435051">Lupart and Toy, 2009</xref>). For example, gifted children can have exceptional mathematical or artistic abilities and also dyslexia or autism. This variety of forms means that any given gifted program can contain a wide range of abilities, domains of talent, and educational needs. It is safe to say that no two gifted children are exactly alike.</p>
<p>Even though there are many different types of giftedness, there are important commonalities among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411435051">Winner, 1996</xref>). For example, gifted children are often precocious and tend to acquire information in certain domains more quickly and rapidly than others of their age. In other words, highly gifted children have unusual accomplishments at surprisingly early ages. In the preschool years giftedness is frequently demonstrated through such behaviors as advanced use of language, precocious reading, mastery of complicated tasks, and exceptional memory. This precocity is most likely to occur in domains that have a well-defined and highly structured body of knowledge that can be acquired through methodical study. In other words, a young gifted child is more likely to excel at reading, musical performance, or mathematics than at musical composition or creative writing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this precocity is often connected to what Ellen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411435051">Winner (1996</xref>, p. 3) calls a ‘rage to master’. Extremely gifted children are deeply and intrinsically motivated to become adept in their areas of interest. Often beginning in the early years of their lives, they are obsessed with particular activities and types of information. Sometimes this obsession is triggered by a crystallizing experience that ignites their latent abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261429411435051">Freeman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261429411435051">Walters and Gardner, 1986</xref>). For example, hearing the harmonies in Wagner’s Overture to Tannhauser was the catalyst for Claude Debussy’s deep interest in composing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261429411435051">Walters and Gardner, 1986</xref>: 307).</p>
<p>Gifted children also process information in ways that are quantitatively and qualitatively different to other children’s processing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261429411435051">Shore, 2000</xref>). For instance, the gifted are more likely than their same-age peers to use divergent, flexible strategies to solve problems and to monitor their solutions. They also tend to create novel methods for selecting, learning, and applying information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429411435051">Davidson, 1986</xref>). They can remember with unusual precision and be very exact in their thinking (Lovecky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261429411435051">1994</xref>). Overall, these differences in thought processes are usually apparent by early adolescence.</p>
<p>Finally, as mentioned earlier, gifted children are more likely than their peers to develop unevenly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261429411435051">Cross, 2005</xref>). Their intellectual, physical, and social developments typically occur at different rates. Their emotional maturity and behavioral control, in particular, often lag behind their advanced cognitive abilities and interests. The greater the degree of giftedness, the greater is the asynchrony. For example, extremely gifted children often have trouble regulating their emotions and making friends. This uneven development makes highly gifted children particularly vulnerable to unhappiness and adjustment problems, which means that they might need special teaching, parenting, and counseling.</p>

<sec id="section3-0261429411435051">
<title>Identifying giftedness</title>
<p>The second part of Attribute 1 is that we know we have been given a gift. It is not really our gift if we are not aware that we have it. This aspect of the attribute involves the recognition of giftedness, which varies from place to place. More specifically, identification of gifted students currently depends, in large part, on how a school district defines giftedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261429411435051">Hertzog, 2009</xref>). Many schools in the United States require children to have high scores on achievement or intelligence (IQ) tests (e.g. an IQ of 130 or above). However, different levels of giftedness often are not acknowledged (Gross, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261429411435051">1994</xref>). These levels include gifted (IQs of 130–144), highly gifted (IQs of 145–159), and profoundly or extremely gifted (IQs of 160 and above). This lack of discrimination results in the inaccurate assumption that all gifted children have a similar degree of intelligence and will, therefore, be similar in their academic abilities and needs.</p>
<p>When creativity is incorporated into a school’s definition of giftedness, psychometric measures of creativity are typically administered, even though these measures do not predict creative development in childhood or significant creative productivity in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261429411435051">Kaufman et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, aptitude tests are often used to identify domain-specific giftedness. For example, the Center for Talented Youth (CTY) at Johns Hopkins University routinely conducts national and international talent searches, where math and verbal scores on the Scholastic Reasoning Test (SAT I) or the American College Test (ACT) are used to discover mathematically and verbally precocious seventh and eighth graders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429411435051">Brody, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Disillusionment with standardized testing and broad conceptions of giftedness have resulted in more frequent use of less traditional forms of assessment. Non-traditional forms of selection include portfolios, auditions, behavioral checklists, performance-based assessment, and classroom observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429411435051">Johnsen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Identification typically takes place relatively late (e.g. elementary school) in order to provide more time for evidence of achievement to accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261429411435051">Silverman and Miller, 2009</xref>). However, this time frame runs the risk of penalizing young gifted girls, who tend to talk, read, and count earlier than their male counterparts. In general, identification in the early preschool years is useful because it helps address the needs that arise as a result of gifted children’s uneven development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261429411435051">Silverman, 1986</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0261429411435051">
<title>The bottom line</title>
<p>Giftedness does not fit our first attribute particularly well. Giftedness cannot be a true gift until we reach consensus on what exactly it is and how best to identify it. However, a universal definition seems achievable in the near future. Although giftedness appears in a variety of forms, their underlying commonalities provide important clues for describing and identifying this currently elusive construct. A well-established and widely used definition would eliminate geographic giftedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411435051">Borland, 1989</xref>), permitting cross-study comparisons and allowing children to officially keep their giftedness when they move from one location to another.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0261429411435051">
<title>Attribute 2: A gift needs some level of care</title>
<p>As noted earlier, all gifts require some level of care if we want them to last. Unfortunately, there is a common false belief that gifted children have no special educational or parenting needs because they can learn and succeed on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261429411435051">Shaughnessy, 2003</xref>). Instead, resources should be expended on children who are academically average or delayed. This mistaken belief means that gifted children are not always sufficiently challenged and their potential is squandered. This is especially likely to occur for low-income, rural, and minority students, who often have limited access to extensive educational opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261429411435051">Ross, 1993</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section6-0261429411435051">
<title>Educational needs</title>
<p>Obviously, children learn best when their cognitive abilities match the difficulty of the curriculum. For example, a child who enters first grade knowing how to read advanced books and write sophisticated essays requires a more challenging curriculum than other first graders could manage. Gifted children can develop a variety of adjustment problems if and when they are placed in classrooms where their ability levels are higher than those of the other children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261429411435051">Gross, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, current educational practices do not always take into account the tendency of gifted children to learn more quickly and with greater complexity than their chronological peers. According to the US Department of Education, ‘Gifted and talented elementary school students have mastered from 35 to 50 percent of the curriculum to be offered in five basic subjects before they begin the school year’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261429411435051">Ross, 1993</xref>, p. 4). When placed in regular classrooms, gifted children are often bored, underchallenged, and unmotivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261429411435051">Stoeger and Ziegler, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, schools sometimes view academically gifted children as an inconvenience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261429411435051">Persson, 2009</xref>). Teachers and peers do not always appreciate students who know more than they do or who reveal problems with classroom procedures. As a result, gifted children who pose a threat to others’ self-esteem or power are stigmatized and marginalized at school. </p>
<p>Fortunately, there are avenues for meeting some gifted children’s educational needs. Grade- and subject-based forms of acceleration provide stimulating and challenging educational environments for gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261429411435051">Colangelo and Assouline, 2009</xref>). Although surprisingly underutilized, acceleration typically results in greater academic achievement than other types of intervention. Contrary to popular belief, it has not been found to harm gifted children’s social competency skills and sometimes it improves them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0261429411435051">
<title>Care-giving needs</title>
<p>It is an understatement to say that parents play a fundamental role in the overall development of their gifted offspring. Obviously all children require supportive care that provides them with an emotionally secure base from which to explore their environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429411435051">Bowlby, 1988</xref>). But what does this entail for parents of gifted children? Research indicates that they need to (1) provide stimulating environments and challenging opportunities; (2) advocate effectively for appropriate programs; (3) allow their children to assume increasing independence and responsibility; and (4) balance high expectations with strong support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261429411435051">Reichenberg and Landau, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261429411435051">Winner, 2000</xref>). Parents’ failure at these tasks can result in behavioral difficulties for their gifted children.</p>
<p>Many parents of gifted children meet the above tasks quite well. They are highly responsive to their progeny’s need to be intellectually challenged and engrossed. In addition, they permit higher than normal amounts of freedom, while providing appropriate support, opportunities, guidance, and discipline. In short, they are authoritative and have high expectations for themselves and their offspring. They are also likely to have moderate to high socioeconomic status and advanced levels of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261429411435051">Winner, 2000</xref>). Unfortunately, not all parents fully understand what it means to be gifted, and therefore they expect too much or too little from their gifted offspring.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0261429411435051">
<title>The bottom line</title>
<p>We do not meet the educational needs of all gifted children nearly as well as we could or should. For example, the benefits of academic acceleration are frequently ignored, many programs are underfunded, and the United States’ <italic>No Child Left Behind Act</italic> of 2001 has undermined appropriate curriculum development for the gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429411435051">Pyryt, 2009</xref>). This disconnect between research and practice means that the main burden of responsibility falls on parents to ensure that their gifted progeny are acknowledged, academically challenged, and socially accepted at school. Some parents are in a better position than others to assume this responsibility.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0261429411435051">
<title>Attribute 3: We know what to do with the gift</title>
<p>Parents and educators would benefit from a universal set of clear guidelines for the identification of, and planning for, gifted children. Ideally, theories of giftedness would provide this type of user’s manual. Current models were developed in response to the changing needs within society and science to view giftedness as more multifaceted than what standardized intelligence tests measure. These models are now in the field playing a large role in shaping and advancing our conceptions of giftedness. In addition to cognitive abilities, they include a variety of other constructs, such as creativity, personality traits, chance, and characteristics related to social responsibility. These recent theories are potentially valuable because they can guide curriculum development, parenting practices, and research. However, they have an exceedingly difficult task, which is to describe, explain, and predict the various forms and features of giftedness.</p>
<sec id="section10-0261429411435051">
<title>Creativity</title>
<p>Unlike their predecessors, most contemporary models of giftedness include creativity. However, they differ in terms of definition and whether creativity plays a necessary or an optional role. For example, Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411435051">Renzulli (2005</xref>) views creativity as original production that is valued by a targeted audience, and he developed his ‘three-ring’ conception of giftedness with creative productive giftedness in mind. Creativity is one of three interactive components (or rings) that accompanies higher-than-average general or domain-specific abilities and strong commitment to a specific area of interest. Each component is essential for giftedness but not sufficient on its own.</p>
<p>In contrast, other models propose that creativity is optional rather than required. For example, the Munich model of giftedness (MMG) portrays creativity as one of many possible competencies that predict later performance in a domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261429411435051">Heller et al., 2005</xref>). According to this view, personality characteristics and environmental factors help determine which of a child’s competencies develop and result in gifted performance. In other words, creativity is not essential for giftedness but, under the right circumstances, it can be sufficient.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261429411435051">Runco (2005</xref>) proposes that personal creativity is both necessary and sufficient for giftedness to occur at all ages. As with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429411435051">Beghetto and Kaufman’s (2007)</xref> concept of ‘mini-c’, personal creativity involves neither original productivity nor external validation. Instead, personally creative individuals have novel interpretations of their own experiences with the world and know when this originality is and is not appropriate and useful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0261429411435051">
<title>Domain specificity</title>
<p>Theories no longer view giftedness simply as a general ability or global trait. Instead, most current views portray it as largely domain specific. For example, some propose that exceptional performance is the result of domain-specific training, deliberate practice, and commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429411435051">Ericsson et al., 2005</xref>). A different example of domain specificity is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261429411435051">Howard Gardner’s (1993)</xref> theory of multiple intelligences, which proposes that individuals can be gifted in one or more of eight intelligences. These separate intelligences vary in their symbol systems, their developmental courses, and the areas of the brain that they employ. Three of them – linguistic, logical–mathematical, and spatial – are related to abilities assessed by standardized intelligence tests. The remaining five – bodily kinesthetic, musical, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and naturalistic – are not measured by these tests but are highly regarded in most cultures.</p>

<title>Social responsibility and wisdom</title>
<p>Theories of giftedness often reflect attributes and potentials that a society values and wants to promote. One recent societal concern involves a perceived decline in social capital or civic actions. Some contemporary models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411435051">Renzulli, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261429411435051">Sternberg, 2005</xref>) address this concern by including characteristics that permit individuals to use their gifts to advance the greater good of others. More specifically, one’s personal qualities (e.g. optimism, courage, passion for a particular topic, wisdom) interact with his or her above-average cognitive ability and creativity. This interaction increases the likelihood that the gifted individual will effectively address collective needs in one or more domains.</p>
<p>As implied above, the benefits of wisdom have become a recent focus of gifted research and theories. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261429411435051">Robert Sternberg’s (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261429411435051">2005</xref>) WICS model proposes that giftedness is based on the synthesis of three somewhat hierarchical qualities: wisdom, intelligence, and creativity. Sternberg’s view of intelligence focuses on individuals’ analytic, creative, and practical abilities. When a balance occurs in this triad of skills, individuals can create original products or ideas that have been undervalued and ‘sell’ them as highly valued by persuading others of their worth. These creators have certain personal characteristics, which include passion, sensible risk-taking, tolerance for ambiguity, and self-efficacy. Wisdom requires both intelligence and creativity. To become wise, individuals first need to use their practical abilities to acquire implicit knowledge about themselves, other people, and situational contexts. Next they must establish a balance between their own short- and long-term interests and the interests of other people and the situation. This balance guides an individual’s intelligence and creativity toward the fundamental goal of achieving a common good for all relevant parties. Although intelligence and creativity play critical roles in giftedness, Sternberg believes that wisdom is the most beneficial trait for a society to seek and foster in its members.</p>

<sec id="section13-0261429411435051">
<title>The cause of giftedness</title>
<p>Finally, theories of giftedness need to explain the source of the construct. Where does giftedness come from? The expertise explanation claims that environmental factors, such as deliberate practice and extensive training, are primarily responsible for exceptional behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429411435051">Ericsson et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, the majority of giftedness theories propose that giftedness is dependent on both genes (nature) and appropriate environmental opportunities (nurture). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429411435051">Gardner (1983</xref>) maintains that individuals become gifted in one or more intelligences through genetic inheritance, environmental opportunities, and socialization of cultural values. In short, all contemporary models assume that the environment plays an important role in creating giftedness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0261429411435051">
<title>The bottom line</title>
<p>The good news is that the current theories have much in common. For example, they have multifaceted conceptions of giftedness that clarify how potential turns into exceptional domain-specific achievement. In addition, they address the heterogeneity of giftedness while maintaining a homogeneous role for intrinsic motivation, information processing, and the environment. Many models even explain why an individual might be viewed as gifted during childhood but not in adulthood and vice versa. Finally, approaches are starting to work with, and not against, each other. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24a-0261429411435051">Franz Monks (1992)</xref> modified Renzulli’s three-ring model to include environmental components that foster or inhibit the development of creativity, motivation, and above-average abilities.</p>
<p>The bad news is that a lot of theoretical work and collaboration still need to occur before we have a well-accepted user’s manual for giftedness. Complex multidimensional models are in danger of not being useful if they cannot be compared with one another or easily falsified. This means that precise operational definitions for creativity and other essential components must be agreed upon and then valid and reliable measures need universally to be adopted. In order to make accurate comparisons, some models will need more clarity and detail. There is a danger that the essence of giftedness is becoming obscured through the number and size of the current models. To help prevent this, aspects of models that are not necessary to describe, explain, and predict gifted behavior need to be eliminated. Most importantly, theories need to be accessible, understandable, and useful to educators and parents.</p>

<sec id="section15-0261429411435051">
<title>Attribute 4: A gift comes without expectations</title>
<p>Out of all of the attributes of a true gift, this is the one that is the most problematic when it is applied to giftedness. We do have high expectations for gifted children. For example, the US Department of Education views gifted and talented children as one of the nation’s most precious resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261429411435051">Ross, 1993</xref>). This view is understandable, but it is also a sign that we expect more from gifted children than we do from others. In short, society wants something in return from these children.</p>
<p>Expectations for gifted children have been around for as long as we have had the concept of giftedness. Even today, we often demand more from gifted children than from their same-age peers, which means that giftedness can become inappropriately incorporated into their identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429411435051">Mahoney, 1998</xref>). For example, we assume academically gifted students will do well in school and if they do not easily surpass their same-age peers, we think they have not put in enough effort. Sometimes teachers and parents can push so hard that gifted children lose their passion and intrinsic motivation for a particular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411435051">Winner, 1996</xref>). In addition, there is a belief that gifted students should learn to provide useful services to society in return for the special resources they receive in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261429411435051">Winner, 2000</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section16-0261429411435051">
<title>A potentially harmful legacy</title>
<p>Lewis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261429411435051">Terman (1925</xref>) may have unintentionally influenced the expectations we hold for gifted children. More specifically, he originated the notion that adult genius could be predicted from a child’s IQ of 140 or higher. To test this belief, Terman initiated his extensive longitudinal study of intellectually gifted children (who became known as the Termites).</p>
<p>Although the Termites were superior to their same-age peers in school achievement, motor coordination, physical condition, and social adjustment, they did not become adult geniuses. Overall, they were successful in their fields of endeavor. The male participants received more college degrees, higher salaries, more awards, and more memberships in honorary societies than the national average. The females showed a similar pattern of mid-life success except, like most women of their generation, they were less likely than the males to have advanced degrees and professional careers. However, despite their high levels of expertise, none of the Termites had groundbreaking discoveries, extraordinary artistic achievements, or other signs of creative eminence. Terman eventually acknowledged that childhood IQ scores of 140 or above did not accurately predict genius in adulthood.</p>
<p>Despite Terman’s retraction, we still have the hope that gifted children will have domain-altering innovations when they become adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261429411435051">Winner, 2000</xref>). However, the probability of this is low. Although both giftedness and genius involve exceptional abilities and intrinsic motivation, adulthood genius typically requires Big-C creativity, problem-finding, high productivity, a strong desire to change the status quo, and recognition by members of one’s field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429411435051">Simonton, 2009</xref>). In contrast, childhood giftedness typically entails precocity and proficiency in one or more domains. Although a small number of gifted children do grow up to be adult geniuses, the differences between these two constructs make it much more likely that giftedness will result in expertise-related, rather than genius-related, eminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261429411435051">Winner, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0261429411435051">
<title>The gifted child’s expectations for herself</title>
<p>Perhaps because of external expectations and feedback, many gifted children are perfectionists who set unrealistically high goals and standards for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411435051">Roedell, 1984</xref>). This is not surprising because they have the cognitive skills necessary for imagining grand projects and for critiquing how close their efforts come to meeting their visions. It should be noted that their perfectionism is not always harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261429411435051">Parker and Mills, 1996</xref>). In fact, it can be productive when it provides motivation for their outstanding achievements. However, gifted children’s perfectionism becomes unhealthy when it hurts their self-esteem, leads to self-blame, and handicaps their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411435051">Roedell, 1984</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0261429411435051">
<title>The bottom line</title>
<p>Giftedness does come with the expectation of receiving something in return, but it is not clear that this is unreasonable. Gifted individuals are a valuable resource and their endeavors could (and do) benefit society. However, expectations become problematic when they are unrealistic or create too much stress. For example, gifted children should not be pressured to become adult geniuses or to place unattainable goals on themselves. There is a difference between realistic expectations and unfair demands. All individuals benefit from the former rather than the latter.</p>

<title>Attribute 5: Is giftedness a gift that children want?</title>
<p>Unfortunately, giftedness is not always a gift that children want or appreciate. When I have asked gifted children and adolescents how they feel about being gifted, the responses have been surprisingly mixed. Some enjoy being able to learn easily and perform well in school. Others describe being gifted as a burden or a curse because they feel lonely, misunderstood, and ‘like an alien’. In general, gifted children recognize that they are not like other children and are not treated the same as their chronological peers. Although this sense of being atypical can foster pride and high self-esteem, it often results in low self-concept, depression, and feelings of isolation or unpopularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261429411435051">Gross, 1993</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section20-0261429411435051">
<title>Friends and foes</title>
<p>If we look back on our own development, we will realize that establishing friendships is a critical part of childhood. Social competency and emotional security are fostered when children have an appropriate peer group. Unfortunately, gifted children’s exceptional abilities can restrict their options for same-age friends. Differences in interests, levels of thought, and complexity of play can make it difficult for them to find close companions. One significant benefit of gifted programs is that they provide a fitting and highly valued peer group for gifted children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261429411435051">Gross, 1993</xref>). Participants appreciate being accepted by their intellectual peers and having friends with whom to share their ideas and common interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261429411435051">Delisle, 1984</xref>). Unfortunately, not all gifted children have access to these programs owing to financial or geographic limitations.</p>
<p>Some gifted students, particularly girls, hide their intellectual abilities and purposely underachieve in an effort to be socially acceptable to their peers. At an early age, many gifted girls are socialized to believe that it is better and safer to fit in with their classmates than to excel academically. Unlike their male counterparts, gifted girls often choose staying with their friends over joining gifted classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261429411435051">Silverman, 1993</xref>). Even more troubling is the finding that gifted girls are more likely than their same-age peers to have low self-confidence and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261429411435051">Klein and Zehms, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, gifted children face several interpersonal and intrapersonal challenges, such as stigma, feelings of isolation, and depression. Gifted girls are in an especially difficult position because they are subjected to tremendous social pressure to appear normal, rather than exceptionally intelligent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261429411435051">Plucker and Levy, 2001</xref>). Moreover, it has been found that other children’s perceptions of giftedness vary based on the gender of the gifted student. Gifted boys are often viewed as popular and funny, whereas gifted girls are seen as unpopular and moody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261429411435051">Luftig and Nichols, 1991</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0261429411435051">
<title>The bottom line</title>
<p>Many gifted children do not view giftedness as a gift. It does not make their lives easier nor are they proud to own it. They cannot return their giftedness but they often try to hide it in order to fit in with their classmates. Unfortunately, it is difficult to make children and adolescents accept those who are different. However, supportive parents, special programs, and friendships with intellectual peers help make giftedness more pleasant for those who receive it.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0261429411435051">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Is giftedness really a gift? Not yet because it does not fit any of the attributes of a gift particularly well. We do not know exactly what giftedness is or how best to identify it; we do not always take care of it; there is no user’s manual that tells parents and teachers how to make the most of giftedness; it comes with high expectations; and not all gifted children want to be gifted because of the stigma and isolation that can result from it.</p>
<p>However, giftedness could become a great gift if we work together to make this our central mission. First, there needs to be consensus on what giftedness is and how it should be identified. This would allow schools, special programs, and research to adopt the same concrete definition and use the same tools of measurement. Second, educational and parenting practices need to be informed by giftedness research and supported by society. This would involve extensive interaction between educators, parents, investigators, and other relevant members of a community. In general, more collaboration is needed within and between all pertinent parties who care about the gifted. In addition, different levels of intellective and non-intellective abilities need to be understood, with the goal of improving current practices so that they fit and foster these abilities.</p>
<p>Clearly these are ambitious goals. Working together to fulfill them would be a true gift that we can give gifted children.</p>
