<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of training peers to function as lifestyle coaches and to deliver a church-based lifestyle modification program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721712447982">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We recruited 6 African-American adults to participate in an 8-hour peer lifestyle coach (PLC) training program followed by a subsequent 2-hour booster session. The PLC training program addressed several key areas, including: (1) developing empowerment-based facilitation, active listening, and behavior change skills; (2) learning self-management strategies (eg, reading food labels, counting calories); (3) practicing session delivery; and (4) interpreting clinical lab results. Training evaluation was conducted retrospectively (immediately following the delivery of the diabetes prevention intervention rather than after the 8-hour training session) and measured program satisfaction and efficacy from the perspective of participants.</p>

<p>Peer lifestyle coaches’ confidence levels for performing core skills (eg, asking open-ended questions, 5-step behavioral goal-setting process) and advanced skills (eg, addressing resistance, discussing sensitive topics) were uniformly high.

<body>
<p>The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was the first large-scale study conducted in the United States to provide evidence that intensive lifestyle modification can significantly reduce the risk of developing diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712447982">1</xref></sup> In fact, results from the DPP’s lifestyle arm found that an intervention that promoted modest weight loss (7%) and moderate physical activity (150 min/wk) led to a 58% risk reduction, whereas a drug intervention led to only a 33% risk reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712447982">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite these compelling findings, there are significant obstacles to implementing the intensive DPP lifestyle intervention in “real-world” settings. First, the DPP was extremely costly, as it employed health professionals as “lifestyle coaches” to provide one-on-one, individualized treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712447982">1</xref></sup> Second, the DPP was time consuming, as it required participants to attend 16 core sessions over a period of 24 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712447982">1</xref></sup> Although clearly effective, the DPP, as originally designed and implemented, is not economically feasible or sustainable, particularly for low-resource communities.</p>
<p>In the original DPP, “lifestyle coaches” were registered dietitians or individuals with graduate training in a relevant health care field (eg, exercise physiology, behavioral psychology, health education). Similarly, in the majority of DPP translation studies, the lifestyle coaches were registered nurses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712447982">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712447982">3</xref></sup> nurse practitioners,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712447982">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712447982">5</xref></sup> a nurse case manager,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712447982">6</xref></sup> registered dietitians,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712447982">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712447982">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712447982"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712447982"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712447982"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712447982"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712447982">12</xref></sup> exercise physiologists,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712447982">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712447982">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712447982"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712447982">11</xref></sup> health educators,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712447982">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712447982">3</xref></sup> medical personnel with diabetes prevention experience,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712447982">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712447982"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712447982">15</xref></sup> health ministers with a medical background,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712447982">16</xref></sup> nurse educators,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712447982">17</xref></sup> clinical health psychologists,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712447982">10</xref></sup> physiotherapists,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712447982">12</xref></sup> and YMCA fitness instructors with an associate’s or bachelor’s degree in exercise or a related health field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712447982">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712447982">19</xref></sup> Although employing health professionals may enhance the efficacy of the intervention, relying on “highly trained” facilitators reduces the ability to translate these programs into low-resource communities that do not have the financial resources to hire health care professionals.</p>
<p>Less attention has been paid to training peers, including community health workers (CHWs), to deliver diabetes prevention programs. Of the few translational DPP studies involving peers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712447982">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712447982"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712447982">22</xref></sup> only 1 study by Katula et al provided a description of the recruitment, selection, and training process CHWs underwent to facilitate a lifestyle modification intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712447982">20</xref></sup> Although CHWs were used rather than professionals, eligibility criteria to become a CHW was still relatively stringent. Specifically, CHW candidates had to have: type 2 diabetes that was under good control; previous group leadership experience; and a personal history of making good nutritional choices, exercising, and losing weight. Furthermore, CHW candidates underwent a 36-hour training program conducted over a period of 6-9 weeks. Although this study enlisted community members to deliver the intervention, the rigorous eligibility criteria and extensive training can still serve as barriers to translating the DPP lifestyle intervention in resource-limited settings.</p>
<p>To date, there is a lack of research on training nonprofessionals to deliver a lifestyle modification intervention in a community setting. To address this gap, this study intended to translate DPP principles into a church-based setting by training peers (vs health care professionals) from the target community (within the church itself) to conduct a culturally and spiritually tailored intervention in an environment (church-based setting) that has the potential to support sustained lifestyle improvements.</p>

<title>Participant recruitment and selection</title>
<p>This study was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board and was conducted in 1 African American church located in Ann Arbor, MI. To recruit PLC candidates, the church pastor and a well-respected minister drafted a list of potential candidates and requested permission from these individuals to be contacted via telephone by research staff. During the initial telephone contact, potential volunteers learned more details about the study and underwent eligibility screening if they expressed interest. The criteria for inclusion were: (1) being a member or affiliate of Bethel AME Church; (2) being ≥ 25 years old; (3) being able to read and write at an eighth-grade level; (4) having transportation to attend training; (5) being able and willing to commit to 8 hours of training; and (6) being willing to serve as a PLC for the diabetes prevention program (ie, Lifelong Prevention program). Criteria for exclusion were: having physical limitations (eg, home bound), serious health conditions, serious psychiatric illness, self-reported excessive alcohol or illicit drug use, or serious diabetes complications (eg, blindness) that would impede meaningful participation in the training program. At the study orientation, a research assistant presented detailed information regarding (1) the Lifelong Prevention program, (2) the training PLC candidates were required to undergo to competently deliver the Lifelong Prevention program, and (3) the roles and responsibilities expected of PLCs. Individuals who wanted to enroll into the training program then completed informed consent documents. To reimburse participants for their time and effort, as well as to offset costs of participation (eg, transportation, child care), participants received a $160 stipend for the 8-hour training program.</p>

<title>Peer Lifestyle Coach Training Program</title>
<p>All PLC candidates were required to participate in an 8-hour training program, which was conducted on a Saturday. A dietitian certified diabetes educator and graduate student in psychology conducted the training. Training was divided into 4 sessions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712447982">Table 1</xref>). Session 1 provided a broad overview of the Lifelong Prevention program and addressed strategies for group facilitation, motivation building, and active listening. Session 2 introduced patient empowerment, active listening skills, and behavior change techniques (eg, building motivation, setting behavioral goals, developing action plans). Session 3 focused on tracking and monitoring skills (eg, record keeping) and discussed how to deliver 5 of the 6 Lifelong Prevention sessions. Session 4 included a practice simulation of session 2 of the Lifelong Prevention program, a feedback and debriefing session, a practice of using curriculum tools, and a review of community-based resources.</p>

<p>To keep PLCs engaged during the 3-month period between the PLC training and the intervention, PLCs received biweekly emails from the project coordinator. The emails reminded the PLCs to practice their assigned sessions, to seek feedback on areas identified as difficult to understand or facilitate, to review current research on lifestyle modification, and to receive updates on participant recruitment. The PLCs also attended a “booster session” 1 week prior to the start of the intervention. The booster session was designed to review active listening, to use the I-SMART action plan forms, and to introduce the telephone support materials. Critical communication skills and preparation for effective empowerment-based phone support were practiced and refined. Each PLC was asked to conduct a mock exercise activity he or she would be leading in an actual Lifelong Prevention session. A PLC wellness meeting was scheduled at the midpoint (week 4) of the core intervention (6 sessions over 8 weeks) at the request of PLCs to discuss concerns, share any difficult experiences, and track progress. The PLCs did not receive any monetary stipend or incentive for attending the wellness meeting. The PLCs were encouraged to attend the sessions they were not assigned as a gesture of support as well as to assist with the transition of one week’s lesson to the following week. The PLCs found attending the optional sessions helpful in that they had additional opportunities to observe how other PLCs employed educational strategies and tools. To offset the cost for participating in this project, PLCs were provided a modest monetary stipend ($20) for each session they facilitated.</p>

<sec id="section9-0145721712447982">
<title>The Lifelong Prevention Program</title>
<p>Although the evaluation of the Lifelong Prevention program is not the focus of this paper, for the purposes of providing a comprehensive picture of PLCs’ roles, responsibilities, and activities, we will briefly describe the program. The Lifelong Prevention program was adapted from the NDEP’s Power to Prevent curriculum and consisted of 6 group-based, face-to-face sessions conducted over a period of 8 weeks followed by 12 biweekly telephone support calls. A question-and-answer versus lecture approach was emphasized. Each session was delivered by a 2-person PLC team. Because there were 6 trained PLCs, each PLC was assigned 2 sessions to co-facilitate as a male-female pair. Each weekly session was conducted by a different PLC team primarily to accommodate PLCs’ schedules, but also to maximize the strength of having a fresh approach to each lesson. Pairing of PLCs ensured at least 1 team member could manage group dynamics (eg, side conversations) during their nonteaching time. The PLCs introduced additional tools and resources in their assigned sessions, such as bringing food to provide examples of healthy snacks or to highlight portion sizes. Each PLC team was asked to meet prior to their scheduled session to review the curriculum and divide up the lesson plan based on their preferences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0145721712447982">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>As mentioned previously, to assess the value and utility of the PLC training, PLCs completed the training evaluation following the 20-week Lifelong Prevention intervention rather than immediately after the PLC training. The training evaluation included the following surveys:</p>
<p>Self-efficacy for core skills was assessed using an 8-item survey. Respondents were asked to rate how confident they felt performing the core skills (eg, asking open-ended questions, using the 5-step behavioral goal-setting model) they learned during PLC training. Confidence levels were scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”).</p>
<p>Self-efficacy for advanced skills was assessed using a 6-item survey. Respondents were asked to rate how confident they felt performing the advanced skills (eg, helping participants identify their own motivation to change, enforcing the ground rules) they learned during the PLC training. Confidence levels were scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”).</p>
<p>Program satisfaction was assessed using a 5-item quantitative survey measuring satisfaction with program length, session length, balance between diabetes education content and skills development, preparation for facilitating a support group, and preparation for working individually with future participants. Satisfaction ratings were scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”).</p>
<p>Efficacy of behavioral training tools was assessed using a 6-item survey. Respondents were asked to rate how effective the various educational tools were on a 3-point Likert scale from 1 (“not at all useful”) to 3 (“very useful”) and qualitative approaches. Tools included (1) game plan food and activity tracker, (2) plate method, (3) diabetes risk profile, (4) NDEP at Fat and Calorie Counter, (5) food Label – nutritional facts, and (6) community mental health resource sheet.</p>
<p>Program efficacy was assessed using the following qualitative questions: (1) What was most effective about the training program in preparing you to facilitate Lifelong Prevention groups? (2) What was least effective about the training program in preparing you to facilitate the Lifelong Prevention groups? and (3) What suggestions do you have to improve the training?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0145721712447982">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Because this investigation was a feasibility and acceptability study, we used observational and descriptive analysis to assess process outcomes rather than statistical analysis to examine pre-/post- training outcomes. Feasibility was defined as the ability (1) to recruit 3-5 PLC candidates within a 2-month window, (2) to have all PLC candidates attend the full 8-hour training session plus booster session, and (3) to retain 3 PLCs who intend to facilitate the subsequent Lifelong Prevention program. Acceptability was defined as (1) receiving a mean satisfaction rating of 4 or greater for program length, session length, and preparation for facilitating group-based and individual support activities; and (2) receiving a mean efficacy rating of 2 or greater for each behavior change tool.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section13-0145721712447982">
<title>Characteristics of the Sample</title>
<p>Participants were between the ages of 50 and 65 years, with a mean of 58 years (SD = 5.8). Of the participants, 50% (n = 3) were women and 50% (n = 3) were men; 100% (n = 6) had a college degree or higher; 67% (n = 4) reported a household income of $70,000 or more; 50% (n = 3) were retired; and 67% (n = 4) had group insurance from an employer.</p>
<p>Of 10 names of potential PLC candidates, we recruited and enrolled 6 individuals who met the eligibility criteria. Of the 6 PLC candidates, only 1 could not attend the 8-hour training session because of a scheduling conflict. As an alternative, this individual participated in a separate 8-hour private training session with the certified diabetes educator. One hundred percent (N = 6) completed the PLC training program and expressed the intention to facilitate the Lifelong Prevention program.</p>

<title>Program Satisfaction</title>
<p>As a group, PLCs were highly satisfied with the program length (m = 4.33), training session length (m = 4.17); balance between content and skills development (m = 4.17); preparation for co-facilitating a Lifelong Prevention group (m = 4.50); and preparation for working one-on-one with participants (m = 4.00).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0145721712447982">
<title>Efficacy of Behavior Change Tools</title>
<p>The PLCs rated each behavioral change tool uniformly high: game plan food and activity tracker (m = 2.83); plate method (m=2.83); diabetes risk profile (m = 2.83); NDEP fat and calorie counter (m = 2.50); food label and nutrition facts (m = 2.67); and Community Mental Health Resource Sheet (m = 2.33).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0145721712447982">
<title>Program Efficacy</title>
<p>When asked what was most effective about the training program, PLCs reported the following: having the lesson plans and issues to be discussed clearly laid out in the manual, having the opportunity to practice during training, learning to listen and ask open-ended questions, and role-playing (eg, learning how to respond to a participant). When asked about suggestions to improve the training program, PLCs reported the following: minimize the period of time between the training program and the actual delivery of the Lifelong Prevention program, and help PLCs understand the value and utility of the goal setting tool (I-SMART action planning form).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>To translate the Diabetes Prevention Program into real-world settings, significant adaptations have been made including training non-health professionals to deliver the lifestyle modification intervention. Of those studies engaging peers and/or community health workers as “lifestyle coaches,” few have provided a description of the training process that individuals undergo to become lifestyle coaches or have assessed the value of training in delivering the intervention effectively from the perspective of the PLCs.</p>
<p>Recruitment, attendance, and retention results would suggest that it is feasible to conduct a training program teaching peers how to deliver a diabetes prevention program. Our decision to conduct an 8-hour training program over a 1-day period was made based on input from the PLC candidates. Although the training period was short, post-intervention feedback clearly demonstrates that PLCs believed the training program provided them with the knowledge and skills necessary to successfully facilitate the Lifelong Prevention core sessions.</p>
<p>After conducting the PLC training and subsequent Lifelong Prevention intervention, we have learned several important lessons. First, as stated in the qualitative feedback, PLC training would yield the greatest benefit if the subsequent intervention is conducted immediately after training rather than a few months after training. Although conducting a booster session immediately prior to the intervention is helpful, a seamless transition from PLC training to intervention implementation is preferred. Facilitation, active listening, and behavior change skills are most likely developed through regular and repeated practice. To better ensure this continuous timeline in the future, all intervention participants should be recruited prior to the PLC training program.</p>
<p>Forming a 2-person PLC team to facilitate sessions carries several advantages. Similar to participants, PLCs also need support during the intervention. Having an additional PLC facilitator fosters a reciprocal support process. Moreover, the PLC partner provides a safe space to discuss intervention-related feelings, thoughts, and experiences. Should the group discussion meander and become unfocused, 1 member of the PLC team can help bring participants back on track. Finally, having a partner to practice newly developed skills such as making reflections or asking open-ended questions is valuable. In fact, according to some qualitative feedback, the PLCs welcomed the multiple opportunities to practice their skills.</p>
<p>Contrary to other DPP translation studies that train lifestyle coaches to deliver every session of a group-based, face-to face program, the PLCs in this study had to facilitate only 2 of 6 possible core sessions. Although our PLCs were highly supportive of this program, some had full-time jobs and others had significant family responsibilities, which prevented them from making a weekly commitment over a 2-month period. Had the PLCs been required to facilitate all 6 core sessions, a large percentage would have had to decline particpation. Clearly, in an uncontrolled, real-world setting, adaptations need to be made to accommodate the amount and type of resources available. In community-based health promotion efforts, it is ill-advised to turn down highly enthusiastic and motivated volunteers even if they can only participate in a limited way.</p>
<sec id="section19-0145721712447982">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Several limitations of this study need to be mentioned. The PLC training was conducted in a single African-American church, and therefore, results are not generalizable to all African-American churches. In our target church, the congregation was small enough that the pastor was able to identify specific parishioners who possessed the qualities we were seeking in a PLC. It is possible that in churches with a substantially larger congregation, strong PLC candidates may not be as easily identified. In addition, our PLC training program also did not include a formal, competency-based certification process. Owing to the brief duration of the training, we did not feel that a formal evaluation would yield meaningful results. However, in a previous 46-hour training program conducted over a period of 12 weeks, we did incorporate a summative evaluation protocol that included pre-established compentencies that candidates needed to meet to graduate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712447982">23</xref></sup> However, in that program, all candidates were either retired or on work disability, availing them the time and flexibility to participate in an intensive training program.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Findings from this study have several implications for diabetes education and health promotion initiatives. Often the communities that are in greatest need of interventions such as the Diabetes Prevention Program are also the same communities that lack the resources to implement these programs. Indeed, efforts toward translating evidence-based interventions into “real-world” settings may require us to “work with what we have.” This study demonstrated that adaptations such as training lay persons rather than health care professionals, using a team-based facilitation approach, and welcoming trained PLC volunteers to donate whatever time they have can increase the translatability of evidence-based lifestyle modification interventions.</p>
