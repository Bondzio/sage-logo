<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infections are common in patients who have received solid organ transplantation and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this population as a consequence of their state of immunosuppression. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, although rare, has been increasingly reported in kidney transplant recipients. All these reports have been in the adult population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811411476">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811411476">2</xref></sup> and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of MAC infection being reported in a pediatric renal transplant recipient. Several cases of MAC infection have, however, been reported in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811411476">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811411476">4</xref></sup> Mycobacterium avium complex infections typically occur in the respiratory tract but may involve soft tissue, skin, and the musculoskeletal system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811411476">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811411476"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811411476">7</xref></sup> Given the rarity of MAC infections in renal transplant recipients, no treatment guidelines currently exist. The most frequent treatment strategy currently involves a combination of antimicrobial therapy and reduction of immunosuppression.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>Our patient was a 17-year-old African American female with a history of end-stage renal disease secondary to renal dysplasia who received a living related donor renal transplant in 2001 at the age of 9 years. The patient was followed in our transplant clinic and her maintenance immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus 1.5 mg <sc>am</sc> and 1.0 mg <sc>pm</sc> with average trough levels around 4.0 mg/dL (range: 2.9-10.7 mg/dL); mycophenolate mofetil 750 mg twice a day, and prednisone, 5 mg daily. Over the course of several years, the patient developed chronic allograft nephropathy confirmed on renal biopsy but maintained a stable renal function with serum creatinine level ranging between 1.5 and 1.7 mg/dL.</p>
<p>In June 2009 (approximately 8 years post–renal transplantation), she presented to an outside hospital with complaints of sore throat, runny nose, difficulty swallowing, and malaise over a 10-day period. She had also noticed some nontender nodules on both sides of her neck and under her chin, as well as nodules in both her breasts. She denied any fevers, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She reported unintentional weight loss of nearly 40 lb over the preceding 6 months (she did not keep regular clinic appointments, which resulted in our not detecting this weight loss sooner). She was evaluated and subsequently transferred to our hospital for further care. An initial physical examination at our center revealed bilateral tonsil enlargement, nontender and freely mobile cervical, submental, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. She had breast masses measuring 1 to 2 cm beneath both nipples. She also had a large, tender abdominal mass in the left lower quadrant. The rest of her physical exam was unremarkable.</p>
<p>Our initial suspicion was posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. We initiated a workup that included a complete blood count, which showed a hemoglobin and hematocrit of 12 mg/dL and 38.4%, respectively. White blood cell count was 10 000/µL (68% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes, 12% monocytes, and 6% bands). Her chemistries showed a blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 30 and 2.3 mg/dL, respectively. Uric acid level was 8.8 mg/dL and lactate dehydrogenase was 144 mg/dL. Viral studies for cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, human T-lymphocytic virus, and BK virus were negative. An abdominal ultrasound revealed mesenteric lymphadenopathy and splenomegally. A follow-up computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed an intra-abdominal mass (approximately 15 cm) consistent with a conglomeration of lymph nodes. A computed tomography scan of the head, neck, and chest showed subcarinal, bilateral supraclavicular, and axillary lymphadenopathy. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. A purified protein derivative test was negative. Excisional cervical lymph node biopsy showed 4 + acid fast bacilli (AFB) and noncaseating granuloma consisting mainly of histiocytes and few lymphocytes. We also obtained a biopsy of the intra-abdominal mass, which showed complete obliteration of the lymph node architecture by diffuse infiltrates of foamy histiocytes containing numerous AFB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811411476">Figure 1</xref>). An initial kidney biopsy did not show any evidence of rejection or AFB. Bone marrow biopsy did not show any lymphoproliferative process and AFB stain was negative. Blood AFB culture returned positive. Following this evaluation, a diagnosis of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder was ruled out and disseminated MAC infection was diagnosed.</p>

</fig>
<p>While workup was ongoing, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued, the dose of tacrolimus was decreased by 50% and prednisone was continued. Following the diagnosis of MAC infection, empiric antituberculous therapy was initiated with rifabutin, clarithromycin, and ethambutol. Moxifloxacin and azithromycin were subsequently added when the patient did not seem to show any response to the initial empiric therapy. Over the next several weeks, the patient’s clinical status did not improve. She developed fevers, abdominal pain, and continued to lose weight. Amikacin and gamma-interferon were added after the initial 2 months of antituberculous therapy. Following these changes, patient’s clinical status began to improve with the disappearance of her fever and reduction in the size of the lymph nodes and intra-abdominal mass. However, the patient’s serum creatinine level began to trend upward and a repeat kidney biopsy showed Banff 1A acute cellular rejection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811411476">Figure 1</xref>). She was treated with a 3-day pulse of methylprednisolone and then started on oral prednisone at a dose of 60 mg per day. This dose was rapidly tapered to 5 mg/d. Within 2 weeks of this treatment, the patient developed disseminated cutaneous nodular lesions confirmed to be MAC on skin biopsy. At this point, tacrolimus was discontinued but the low-dose prednisone was maintained. Over the next several months, patient’s clinical condition fluctuated and she had several hospital admissions for malnutrition, vomiting, continued weight loss, and intermittent abdominal pain. The patient eventually died of sepsis about 18 months after her initial diagnosis of disseminated MAC infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mycobacterium avium complex infection has been increasingly reported in adult renal transplant recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811411476">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811411476">2</xref></sup> The low level of immunosuppression may play a role in the emergence of this infection in this population. The disease may manifest as disseminated infection, lung, skin, soft tissue, and musculoskeletal infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811411476">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811411476"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811411476">7</xref></sup> MAC-associated acute interstitial nephritis leading to acute allograft dysfunction has also been reported in adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811411476">8</xref></sup> Although several cases of MAC infection have been reported in adult renal transplant recipients, none has been reported in the pediatric transplant population.</p>
<p>Given the rarity of this infection in renal transplant recipients, the risk factors and clinical course of MAC infection in this population are poorly understood. This emphasizes the need for maintaining a high index of suspicion to enable early diagnosis and intervention. Our patient presented with insidious weight loss, malaise, and subsequent development of generalized lymphadenopathy.</p>
<p>Although treatment guidelines exist for MAC infection in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811411476">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811411476">10</xref></sup> there are currently no treatment guidelines for the renal transplant population. Our treatment strategy following diagnosis was the reduction of immunosuppression and institution of broad-spectrum antimycobacterial therapy, including clarithromycin, rifabutin, ethambutal, moxifloxacin, and azithromycin. Our patient did not show any response until adjunctive treatment with gamma-interferon and amikacin was introduced. Clinical response was demonstrated by a reduction in the size of the lymph nodes and improvement in her temperature curve and appetite. A similar clinical response was reported in a study by Holland et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811411476">11</xref></sup> in which patients showed marked clinical improvement within 8 weeks of the introduction of gamma-interferon. Unfortunately, our patient developed acute cellular rejection in her graft during this period of improvement. Attempts at treatment of her rejection resulted in exacerbation of her MAC infection. This demonstrates the risks and treatment challenges involved in managing renal transplant recipients with MAC infection. As more cases are identified, large studies will need to be conducted to determine risk factors, diagnostic criteria, and optimal treatment strategies for MAC infection in kidney transplant recipients.</p>
