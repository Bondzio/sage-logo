<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This article aims to describe potential racial differences in dementia care among nursing home residents with dementia. <bold>Methods:</bold> Using data from the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) in regression models, the authors examine whether non-Whites are less likely than Whites to receive special dementia care—defined as receiving special dementia care services or being in a dementia special care unit (SCU)—and whether this difference derives from differences in resident or facility characteristics. <bold>Results:</bold> The authors find that non-Whites are 4.3 percentage points less likely than Whites to receive special dementia care. <bold>Discussion:</bold> The fact that non-Whites are more likely to rely on Medicaid and less likely to pay out of pocket for nursing home care explains part but not all of the difference. Most of the difference is due to the fact that non-Whites reside in facilities that are less likely to have special dementia care services or dementia care units, particularly for-profit facilities and those in the South.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that Whites and non-Whites are far from “equal” in a health care setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264311432311">Kaiser Family Foundation, 2009</xref>). Using wide-ranging measures of quality of care, studies have shown that minority nursing home residents receive care that is of poorer quality than White residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311432311">Bonham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264311432311">Council of Ethical and Judicial Affairs [CEJA], 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264311432311">Lapane, Barbour, Van Haaren, &amp; Gambassi, 1999</xref>). Racial differences identified in these studies may have two components: “across-facility” differences that refer to variations due to differences in facility characteristics (facilities used by different groups may have different staffing levels and sources of payment, for example), and “within-facility” differences that point to differences in treatment of certain groups within a facility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264311432311">Lapane et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264311432311">Mor, Zinn, Angelelli, Teno, &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264311432311">Smith, Feng, Fennell, Zinn, &amp; Mor, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898264311432311">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>With 1.5 million residents in 2004 (National Nursing Home Survey [NNHS], 2004), some aspects of quality of care in nursing homes have been well studied during the past few decades. Existing studies have examined differences in nursing home quality by both facility and resident characteristics measuring structure or institutional characteristics (e.g., staffing), process, or what is being done for patients (e.g., inappropriate use of or lack of use of medications), and patient outcomes (e.g., mortality or falls) that result in inequality of care or unequal access to care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264311432311">Donabedian, 1966</xref>). Among facility characteristics, most studies found that for-profit, chain-affiliated, and large nursing homes deliver lower-quality care than nonprofit facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264311432311">Aaronson, Zinn, &amp; Rosko, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264311432311">Harrington, Woolhandler, Mullan, Carrillo, &amp; Himmelstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264311432311">Hillmer, Wodchis, Gill, Anderson, &amp; Rochon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264311432311">Intrator, Castle, &amp; Mor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264311432311">Mor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898264311432311">Spector et al., 1998</xref>). Others have found that location (Metropolitan Statistical Area [MSA] vs. Non-MSA; Southern vs. other regions) and payer mix are associated with quality of care: Nursing homes in the South and those with a higher prevalence of residents whose primary payer is Medicaid may experience a lack of resources and have poorer patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264311432311">Aaronson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311432311">Becker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264311432311">Bradley, Clement, &amp; Lin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264311432311">Donoghue, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264311432311">Feng, Grabowski, Intrator, Zinn, &amp; Mor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264311432311">Fenton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264311432311">Grabowski, Aschbrenner, Rome, &amp; Bartels, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264311432311">Gruneir, Miller, Feng, Intrator, &amp; Mor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264311432311">Hughes, Lapane, &amp; Mor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264311432311">Kang-Yi, Mandell, Mui, &amp; Castle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264311432311">Mor et al., 2004</xref>; Reichman et al., 1998; Shea et al., 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898264311432311">Wodchis, Hirth, &amp; Fries, 2007</xref>). Race and socioeconomic status are consistently associated with a wide range of access, use, and quality-of-care variables in health care settings, including nursing homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264311432311">Mayberry, Mili, &amp; Ofili, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264311432311">Mor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264311432311">Smith et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898264311432311">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898264311432311">Williams, 1999</xref>). Studies have shown that racial minorities who have limited personal out-of-pocket resources and live in poorer neighborhoods are more likely to be in nursing homes that are located in their own communities and have fewer resources and of lower quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264311432311">Angelelli, Grabowski, &amp; Mor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264311432311">Fennel, Miller, &amp; Mor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264311432311">Grabowski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264311432311">Mor et al., 2004</xref>; Reed &amp; Andes, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264311432311">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). The use of Medicaid is associated with low socioeconomic status and disability, and nursing homes with a disproportionately high number of residents paid for by Medicaid are generally poor in resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264311432311">Grabowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264311432311">Mor et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>With nearly 90% of residents aged 65 years and older, dementia is a common diagnosis among nursing home residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264311432311">Alzheimer’s Association, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264311432311">Jones, Dwyer, Bercovitz, &amp; Strahan, 2009</xref>). The 2004 NNHS shows that nearly half of nursing home residents (48.3%) have a diagnosis of dementia. Findings from earlier studies have shown that minorities with dementia are more likely to be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed and less likely to be prescribed dementia medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264311432311">Clark et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311432311">Leo, Narayan, Sherry, Michalek, &amp; Pollock, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264311432311">Mehta, Yin, Resendez, &amp; Yaffe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898264311432311">Zuckerman et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Caring for residents with dementia can be a challenge, and practitioners have recognized the effectiveness of person-centered care and proper training of caregivers in meeting this challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264311432311">Alzheimer’s Association, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264311432311">McGilton et al., 2007</xref>). In recent years, there has been an increase in special care units (SCU) designated for dementia care within nursing homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264311432311">Castle, 2008</xref>). SCUs first emerged in nursing homes to better meet the needs of residents with dementia as well as protect residents who did not have dementia. Advocates believe that an SCU for dementia fosters better care for residents with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264311432311">Luo, Fang, Liao, Elliott, &amp; Zhang, 2010</xref>). There are variations among SCUs, and not all SCUs have the same amenities and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264311432311">Grant, Kane, &amp; Potthoff, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264311432311">Grant, Potthoff, &amp; Ryden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264311432311">Sidell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898264311432311">Sloane, Lindeman, Phillips, Moritz, &amp; Koch, 1995</xref>). Although the utility of SCUs for dementia continues to be debated, studies have shown that SCUs may lead to greater time spent with residents, a safer physical environment, more specialized staff training, and better clinical outcomes (fewer hospitalizations and fewer dementia residents with feeding tubes) compared with non-SCUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264311432311">Gruneir, Lapane, Miller, &amp; Mor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264311432311">Luo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264311432311">Nobili et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264311432311">Mitchell, Teno, Roy, Kabumoto, &amp; Mor, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to examine racial differences in dementia care among nursing home residents with dementia. We use data from a nationally representative sample of nursing home residents to disentangle racial differences associated with resident and provider factors. More specifically, we attempt to answer the following questions: Are there racial differences in dementia care received by nursing home residents (e.g., differences in the use of special dementia care units or special dementia care services)? Are these differences related to resident- or provider-level factors or both?</p>

<title>Data, Measures, and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0898264311432311">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The data used for this analysis come from the NNHS, a series of periodic nationally representative sample surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‘s (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264311432311">Jones et al., 2009</xref>, for a detailed description of survey).</p>
<p>Up to 16 current diagnoses were collected for each sampled resident. Since our primary focus is on dementia management, only residents who had any diagnosis of dementia (i.e., who had ICD-9 [International Classification of Diseases] codes of 290.0, 294.1, 294.0, 294.11, 294.8, 310, 331.0, or 797 in any of 16 current diagnoses) were included in the analyses. The resulting resident sample included 6,332 residents with dementia, for a weighted national count of 720,541 residents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898264311432311">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Our primary goal in this analysis is to describe the association between race and management of dementia among nursing home residents who are diagnosed with dementia. Some experts argue that SCUs and specially trained staff may better meet the needs of dementia care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264311432311">Guneir et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264311432311">Luo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264311432311">Nobili et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, for this study we assume that a resident may be more likely to receive special dementia care in an SCU or when receiving special services for dementia compared with not being in an SCU or receiving special dementia care services. We derived our dependent variable—receiving special dementia care—by combining responses to survey questions on SCU and special services. Questions about SCUs and special services for dementia were included both in the facility and resident questionnaires (visit ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Questionnaires/nnhs/2004/ for survey questionnaires). There were slight differences in the wording of the questions, but the intent was the same, that is, to identify whether facilities were equipped to provide these services and whether residents were receiving them.</p>
<sec id="section5-0898264311432311">
<title>Addressing discrepancies between resident and facility data</title>
<p>As a first step, for each resident, responses to the SCU and special services questions on the resident data were matched with the facility data to identify whether there were any discrepancies in the responses. A total of 21 residents who were coded as <italic>living in a special care dementia unit</italic> on the resident file lived in facilities that were coded as <italic>not having a special care dementia unit</italic> on the facility file. Similarly, 153 residents were indicated as <italic>receiving special services for dementia</italic> in the resident file, whereas the facility file indicated that these facilities did not provide special services for dementia. In addition, one resident was reported as living in an SCU and receiving special services in the resident file, whereas the facility file indicated that the facility neither had SCUs nor offered special services. These cases were dropped from the analyses. However, we find similar results to those reported here if those cases are kept as reported on the resident file.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0898264311432311">
<title>Dependent variables as measures of special dementia care management</title>
<p>We use two outcome measures in the analyses. One measure uses a mutually exclusive three-category variable indicating whether a resident was (a) located in an SCU and/or receiving special services; (b) neither located in an SCU nor receiving special services, although at least one of the two are available in the nursing home; or (c) neither located in an SCU nor receiving special services and neither is available in the nursing home. The other measure is dichotomous, indicating whether a resident received special dementia care or not. This dichotomous measure is created by collapsing the second and third categories of the previously described three-category variable to create the <italic>not receiving special care</italic> category, irrespective of whether special care is available or not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0898264311432311">
<title>Independent and control variables</title>
<p>Given that earlier studies have found differences in health care use and between Whites and minority groups, the racial categories for the independent variable are White and non-White. The non-White group was overwhelmingly Black (84.5%). Although other minorities were included, the size of their population was insufficient to be analyzed separately. African Americans constituted about 11.4% of the overall sample, Asians about 0.7%, and Pacific Islanders 0.3%. The Hispanic population constituted about 3.4% of the sample. Because the sample was small, they were included in their respective race categories (White Hispanics in the White group and Black Hispanics in the Black group). The control variables in the analyses include selected resident and facility characteristics.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0898264311432311">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Bivariate analyses provide descriptive information about the sample’s characteristics by race. We also evaluate in bivariate analyses the association between the dependent variables and independent and control variables. Chi-square tests were used as measures of association. If chi-squares showed significant associations, we used a <italic>t</italic>-test post hoc procedure to make pairwise comparisons between different categories of variables. Significant results from the post hoc procedure are reported in the text.</p>
<p>We used a logistic regression model to assess whether there were racial differences in receiving special care for dementia, with and without additional control variables. We then estimated a multinomial logistic regression model for the three-category dependent dementia management variable to assess possible reasons for any differences in care received. For ease of referring to the categories of the dependent variable, we will use the terms “special care,” “equipped,” and “unequipped,” respectively, to refer to residents who are receiving special services and/or in an SCU for dementia; residents not receiving either of these, although the facility is equipped to provide at least one of them; and residents who are not receiving these as they are in facilities that are unequipped. For both the logit and the multinomial logit regressions, we entered the predictors in four steps, to assess the reasons for any observed differences in the receipt of potentially appropriate dementia care. The first model included race as the only predictor, the second added resident demographics only (age group and gender), the third added resident-level primary source of payment, and the fourth added nursing home characteristics (chain, ownership, bed size, regional location, and MSA status). Since marginal effects from a logit or multinomial logit model are nonlinear functions of the parameter estimates and the levels of the explanatory variables, they cannot be inferred directly from the parameter estimates. We, therefore, use the parameters from the estimated models to predict the probabilities of receiving or not receiving potentially appropriate dementia care for different values of each categorical independent variable, holding all other covariates at their observed values. We then report marginal effects as the mean differences in the predicted probability for each value of the categorical independent variable relative to its reference category.</p>
<p>All analyses were performed using SAS-callable SUDAAN, a statistical software program that takes into account the complex sample design of the NNHS 2004, including nonindependence of observations within sampling design units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898264311432311">Research Triangle Institute, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264311432311">SAS Institute, 2003</xref>), yielding standard errors that are conservative relative to those that would be obtained through the use of multilevel modeling.</p>

<title>Characteristics of the Sample</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264311432311">Table 1</xref> presents the characteristics of the sample overall and by race. Although there were generally more women in the sample, the proportion of women was higher among Whites than non-Whites (76.3% compared to 71.8%). More than half of the participants were aged 85 years and older (where those aged 85 and older are defined as the “oldest old”). The proportion of oldest old was higher among Whites (55.9%) than among non-Whites (41.0%). Sources of payment also varied by race: Nearly half of the non-Whites (44.8%) had Medicaid as the primary source of payment, compared to 27.2% of Whites who had Medicaid. Almost a quarter of the Whites (24.9%) used out-of-pocket and other mostly private sources of payment, compared to only 7.0% of the non-Whites (1.9% of those with “out-of-pocket or other” were “other,” including less than 1% who were Veterans). More than three fourths of the sample participants were in nursing homes located in metropolitan areas: A higher proportion of non-Whites were in metropolitan areas than Whites. About 60% of the participants were in for-profit nursing homes; the proportion of the participant population in for-profit nursing homes was higher among non-Whites. A higher proportion of the non-Whites compared to the Whites lived in nursing homes that had 100 or more beds. Finally, non-Whites were more likely to be in nursing homes in the South and less likely to be in homes in the Northeast compared to Whites.</p>

<title>Sample Descriptive Statistics by Special Care for Dementia Management</title>
<p>About one fifth (18.3%) of nursing home residents with a diagnosis of dementia received special care for dementia. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311432311">Table 2</xref> compares sample characteristics by special dementia care management. There were significant differences in dementia care between Whites and non-Whites: A lower proportion of non-White than White nursing home residents with dementia received special care. This difference is about 4.3 percentage points (18.8% for Whites compared to 14.5% for non-Whites). The proportion of residents who received special care was highest among those who primarily used out-of-pocket/other payments relative to different sources of payment. The proportion of participants receiving special care was lower among those in for-profit nursing homes compared to nonprofit and government nursing homes. Bed size was related to special care for dementia management; those in larger facilities are more likely to receive special care. The lowest proportion of residents receiving special care was in the South compared to other regions.</p>

<p>The last two columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311432311">Table 2</xref> divide residents not receiving special care between those living in facilities that are “equipped” to provide the care and those that are not. Of the 81.8% of the residents not receiving special care, 60% were in facilities that were equipped and another 40% were in facilities that were not equipped (data not shown). A higher proportion of non-Whites compared to Whites are in facilities that are not equipped. The proportion of residents who were in facilities that were not equipped was higher in nursing homes that were located in areas other than micropolitan and metropolitan areas. Residents in smaller facilities were more likely to be in unequipped facilities. Residents in for-profit facilities and those in the South also were more likely to be in facilities that were not equipped.</p>

<title>Multivariate Analyses</title>
<p>The first model of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311432311">Table 3</xref> predicts whether or not nursing home residents with dementia receive special care, controlling only for race. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311432311">Table 3</xref>, non-Whites are 4.3 percentage points more likely to lack special care compared to Whites, a difference that is statistically significant at the 5% level. The second model adjusts for age and gender to see whether part of this 4.3 percentage point difference can be explained by different age and gender distributions by race. Adjusting for age and gender slightly increases the size of the estimated difference in the probability of receiving special care by race from 4.3 percentage points to 4.9 percentage points. Because differences by race in sources of payment identified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264311432311">Table 1</xref> may be one reason why non-Whites are less likely to receive special dementia care compared to Whites, the third model of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311432311">Table 3</xref> then adjusts for primary source of payment for the nursing home stay and length of stay. Results indicate that those with Medicare, Medicaid, and unknown source of payment are more likely to lack special care than those paying out of pocket. And primary source of payment does partially explain the race difference in the probability that residents receive special dementia care; controlling for primary payment source reduces the estimated size of the difference in probability of not receiving special care from 4.9 percentage points to 3.6 percentage points, though still statistically significant.</p>

<p>The final model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311432311">Table 3</xref> adds controls for facility characteristics. The addition of these characteristics leaves a 2.8 percentage point difference in care by race, a difference that is no longer statistically significant. Statistically significant facility characteristics include ownership (residents in for-profit facilities are less likely to receive special care than those in other facilities), region (residents in the South are less likely to receive special care compared to those in the reference category of the West and compared to other regions), and bed size (residents in smaller facilities are less likely to receive special care than those in larger facilities). When models were estimated excluding ownership, region, and bed size and then adding them one by one, it was found that adding only bed size left a statistically significant (at the 5% level) race difference that was actually larger than the model without bed size (4.2 percentage points compared to 3.9 without bed size, ownership, or region). This is undoubtedly because, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264311432311">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311432311">2</xref> showed, non-White residents are more likely than White residents to live in facilities with at least a 100 beds, and residents in facilities with at least 100 beds are more likely to receive special care. But adding either region or ownership resulted in a race difference that became statistically insignificant. Non-Whites are more likely to live in the South and in for-profit facilities, two facility characteristics that are associated with a lower likelihood of receiving special care.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0898264311432311">Table 4</xref> contains results from the multinomial logit model. The model predicts whether nursing home residents did not receive special care by dividing this group of residents into those who were in facilities that were equipped to provide care and those who were in facilities that were not. The direction of the association between race and the likelihood of receiving care varies by whether care is available or not. Non-Whites are 9.5 percentage points <italic>more</italic> likely than Whites not to receive care because they live in facilities that are not equipped, but they are 6.8 percentage points <italic>less</italic> likely than Whites to lack special care when they live in a facility equipped to provide that care. The 2.8 percentage point difference in care by race in the final column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311432311">Table 3</xref> combines these opposite results. Geographic region, size of nursing home, ownership, and primary payer continue to be significantly associated with receipt of special care. When a resident has Medicaid or Medicare as primary source of payment, the resident is at an increased likelihood of lacking special care, even when living in an equipped facility. (Supplementary analysis not shown indicates that including variables for the facility shares of residents with primary source of payment of Medicare and Medicaid did not alter results and these variables were statistically insignificant even at the 10% level.) Further research is warranted to understand why differences in source of payment may be associated with differences in care provided within a facility. Whether a facility is equipped to provide special care is related to ownership, bed size, and region, since these characteristics are also associated with not receiving special care. Differences in ownership, facility size, and region lead to differences in care across facilities.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Across a variety of health care settings, studies have shown evidence of racial differences in treatment and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264311432311">Bowen &amp; Gonzalez, 2008</xref>). This article was motivated in large part by the fact that fewer studies have considered racial differences in nursing home care, and these do not distinguish between overall differences in care and differences in care that arise because facilities are not equipped to provide care. Our analyses suggest that among nursing home residents with dementia, Whites are more likely than non-Whites to receive special care for dementia. Part of the reason for this difference is due to differences in sources of payment between Whites and non-Whites; differences that our analysis suggested may even be associated with differences in care within facilities. The likelihood of receiving special care is highest for residents who pay primarily out of pocket. In our sample, about a quarter of White residents paid out of pocket compared to only about 7% of non-Whites. Differences in sources of payment account for about 1 percentage point of the 4.3 percentage point difference in the likelihood of receiving special care between Whites and non-Whites. However, significant race differences in care remain even when accounting for source of payment.</p>
<p>Race differences in dementia care in nursing homes appear to primarily derive from facility differences in the likelihood of having SCUs or special programs for dementia. Facilities in the South and for-profit facilities are less likely to have SCUs or special services compared to other facilities. Since non-Whites are more likely than Whites to live in the South and reside in for-profit facilities, they are less likely to receive special dementia care.</p>
<p>Results from this study confirm findings from earlier studies that racial differences in nursing homes parallel differences in neighborhood characteristics by race. Non-Whites are more likely to have Medicare and Medicaid as their primary source of payment and live in poorer neighborhoods that may have nursing homes that lack resources. These results show how race and residential location can indirectly affect access to health care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0898264311432311">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are some limitations to this study. First, in this study we assume that survey questions that relate to SCUs and special services for dementia are proper measures to estimate potentially appropriate care management for residents with dementia. There may be other better indicators of potentially appropriate dementia care that are not included in the study, such as use of physical restraints, use of feeding tubes, or appropriate use of dementia medications. However, although SCUs and special services may not be the universal gold standard to evaluate dementia care, differences in the use of these services do indicate a difference in type of care received by residents, which may result in inequality of care or unequal access to care.</p>
<p>This study does not control for severity or type of dementia, which may be associated with the care received by residents. However, earlier studies have indicated that minorities (non-Hispanic Blacks and Latinos) transition from the community to a long-term care facility at relatively more advanced stages of dementia than their White counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264311432311">Stevens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898264311432311">Yaffe et al., 2002</xref>). Given these differences, it is likely that the minority residents in this study are at similar or more advanced stages of dementia compared to Whites, and therefore, in similar or greater need for specialized care. A final limitation of this study: Given that there were few members of other racial and ethnic groups in the sample, this study examined White/non-White differences only. Despite the limitations described earlier, results from this study confirm that Whites and non-Whites differ in the dementia care they receive in nursing homes and that this difference may be largely tied to the fact that non-Whites are more likely to be paying for care through Medicaid and are more likely to be in homes that are for profit and in South. In the future, more focused studies examining the other aspects of quality of care received for dementia patients in nursing homes is needed (such as use of physical restraints, use of feeding tubes), in addition to study of the links between care received and outcomes. Studies capable of examining differences in care received by different specific minority groups will also be helpful. This work is likely to be increasingly important given projected increases in the elderly nursing home population with dementia.</p>
