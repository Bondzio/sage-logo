<p>Having natural resources in abundance including oil and gas reserves, apart from being a strong market for millions of consumers, Central Asia as a region not only connects Asian and European continents but also provides the shortest transit route to Europe from Asia. What is striking is that its importance lies into the centrality of the region’s geographical location and therefore, geographic factors have had a tremendous influence on the whole region so much so that Central Asia has now become a region of geopolitical, geoeconomic and geostrategic significance in the sphere of international relations. Looking back into antiquity, one can find that the Central Asian territory was the main route for the Great Silk Road linking Europe with Asia, in particular China and India. Now that the twenty-first century has been witnessing a reorganisation of the Great Silk Road, Central Asia occupies a special place in India’s foreign policy priorities. Unlike the past, its importance to India today remains not just merely civilisational, but geopolitical and economic as well. However, so far India has not been able to achieve the desired objectives in Central Asia due to disadvantages at several fronts, which calls for revamping Indian strategies in this landlocked region. It is in this context that the book under review provides a relevant perspective on components that shape Indian perceptions and strategies towards its relations with Central Asia.</p>
<p>The idea of the book, primarily, developed from two paradoxes that have clearly been explained in the general introduction by the volume editors Marlène Laruelle and Sébastien Peyrouse. While the first paradox concerns with relations between India and Central Asia, the second concerns Indian knowledge of Central Asia. The editors are of the opinion that the topic of India–Central Asia relations has become one of the great classics of geopolitical discourse on the region, although it has never been studied, and that its discursive activity by far exceeds the reality of bilateral relations. There are, in fact, various explanations for the discrepancy between discursive activity and the reality of bilateral relations, which the book has dealt with at length. For a proper understanding of the subject, the book has been divided into three parts, focusing on the history of India–Central Asia relations, the state of relations in the post–Cold War period, and the role that various regional tensions involving Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kashmir and Xinjiang play in the relationship. Whereas the two editors, Laruelle and Peyrouse, have written a general introduction, introductory chapters to each section and a conclusion, Indian scholars have made their worthy contributions as individual chapters.</p>
<p>To begin with, Part I of the book entitled ‘The Past as a Link? Reassessing Indo-Central Asian History’ includes five chapters. Marlène Laruelle in her chapter ‘Foreign Policy and Myth-making: Great Game, Heartland, and Silk Roads’ opines that the idea of reviving the Silk Roads offers a historical background to eminently contemporary phenomena, and makes it possible for both Central Asia and India to point up their prestigious shared past to develop a common language that avoids geopolitical, political or economic disagreements, and to reduce the colonial past during which both regions were marginalized to a parenthesis. Such an opinion sets the tone for analysing India–Central Asia relations in a historical perspective by the other four contributors. Suchandana Chatterjee in her chapter ‘Bukhara in a Revolutionary Time and Its Indian Connections’ as well as Surendra Gopal in his chapter ‘The Opening and Closing of Direct Indo-Central Asian Relations, 1924–1940’ look into the key roles played by leaders and intellectuals in the establishment of India–Central Asia relations right from the end of the nineteenth century up to the Soviet period. Anita Sengupta’s chapter ‘Perceptions and Strategies: India’s Relations with the Central Asian Region’ and Sreemati Ganguli’s ‘The Revival of the Silk Roads Topic: A Contemporary Analysis’ examine the influence of not only historical but also the geopolitical perceptions in devising India’s strategies in Central Asia.</p>
<p>Part II of the book entitled ‘Contextualizing Indo-Central Asian Relations: Hopes, Disillusions, and Pragmatism’ covers four chapters including Sébastien Peyrouse’s essay on ‘Domestic and International Articulations of the Indian involvement in Central Asia’, which emphasises the characterisation of India–Central Asia relations. In his words, ‘India finds itself frustrated between the projection of power and <italic>Realpolitik</italic>, between possibilities and achievements, and between being a rising power and lacking international leverage’. Such a portrayal of Indian involvement in Central Asia has taken a further step in Ajay Kumar Patnaik’s chapter on ‘Framing Indo-Central Asian Relations, 1990s–2000s’, which investigates into difficulties that India has faced during the past two decades in implementing a specific policy in Central Asia. While Jagannath P. Panda’s chapter ‘India’s New Look at Central Asia Policy: A Strategic Review’ focuses on India’s strategic stakes in Central Asia, Gulshan Sachdeva’s essay on ‘Indo-Central Asian Economic Relations’ examines the economic implications for India in Central Asia, given the latter’s vast energy resources and New Delhi’s investment potential.</p>
<p>‘The In-Between Points of Tension: Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kashmir, and Xinjiang’ is the main theme of Part III of the book that includes four chapters; all of them deal with regional geopolitical uncertainty due to points of tension located between India and Central Asia, and that impede the growth of bilateral economic relations in particular. In their chapter ‘Managing Regional Geopolitical Uncertainty’, Marlène Laruelle and Sébastien Peyrouse provide a perspective on how to manage regional geopolitical uncertainty which has emerged as the key challenge for increasing Indian engagement in Central Asia. While analysing the major role played by Indo-Pakistani tensions in structuring Indian policy in Central Asia, Meena Singh Roy in her chapter ‘India’s Policy towards Central Asia: The Pakistan Factor’ stresses that ‘it is time to move away from the unilateral benefits paradigm to the cooperative regional paradigm’. While Mustaq A. Kaw in his essay ‘Restoring India’s Links with Central Asia across Kashmir: Challenges and Opportunities’ puts forward a way of diffusing the Kashmiri political conflict by pulling the region from its economic isolation, Ajay Darshan Behera in his chapter ‘The Resurgence of the Taliban and Regional Security Concerns’ emphasises Indian strategies toward the Taliban, the resurgence of which damages the regional security environment. In his chapter ‘The Xinjiang Issue: Indian Perspectives on Chinese Strategies in the Far West’, K. Warikoo highlights not only the problematic situation of Uyghur secessionism but also assesses the Chinese policy in Xinjiang where Beijing tolerates no international interference. Lastly, Marlène Laruelle and Sébastien Peyrouse make the prospective remarks on India–Central Asia relations in their concluding chapter that argues ‘Which Future for India in Central Asia?’</p>
<p>Overall, the book is a bold initiative in providing not only much-needed information about India–Central Asia relations but also reflecting the way in which India constructs ‘Central Asia’ as an object. Moreover, the book can be read at two levels as the editors claim: First, it is a classic academic work which offers a collective viewpoint on the different facets of India’s engagement and strategies in Central Asia, and second, it is conceived as a testimony designed to give a voice to Indian scholars who, each in their own way, reflect India’s perceptions of the Central Asian region. Though it does not denounce the Western point of view on the subject, it somehow puts a break on treating India and Central Asia as virginal terrains. From an academic point of view, all the contributors except the editors are Indian having exclusive expertise on Central Asian affairs for a long time now. The best parts of the book are the editors’ contributions that provide a sophisticated and critical interpretation of the issues dealt with.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it needs to be mentioned here that despite India’s weak presence in Central Asia at the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century, the Indian viewpoint as highlighted in the book perhaps gives way to reformulation of India’s Central Asia policy. And indeed, June 2012 witnessed India unveiling its new ‘Connect Central Asia’ policy, a new strategy of engaging itself with Central Asia. This policy is based on proactive political, economic and people-to-people engagement with all the five Central Asian countries, both individually and collectively. As such a book like this is always welcome for the simple reason that it not only caters the needs of the academic world but also contributes to policy planning.</p>
