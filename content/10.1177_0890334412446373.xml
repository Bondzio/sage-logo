<body>
<p>We must be doing something right. Lately the infant formula industry has been engaged in an unprecedented amount of marketing activity. There has been the usual hyperbole on Web sites and printed materials about new ingredients guaranteed to make babies smarter, see better, have healthier immune systems, grow better brains, and get all the vitamins they need. However, marketing efforts have been branching out to include areas of influence not tapped before. For example:</p>
<p>1. The Nestle Corporation created the Nestle-Newark Advisory Board, and along with the city of Newark, New Jersey, will jointly engage in a campaign designed to reduce childhood obesity. The city of Newark accepted a check for $100,000 from Nestle to run a 2-year pilot program that will provide parents in Newark with infant and toddler nutrition information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412446373">1</xref></sup> The child nutrition information will be provided by Nestle’s nutritionists through the city’s 15 Family Success Centers. Nestle formula ads appeared on the February 2012 press release. This new marketing effort by Nestle, disguised as benevolent charity, is spreading to other states, including Michigan. Nestle will help to “educate” medical schools, hospitals, grocery stores, and the community about nutritious eating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412446373">2</xref></sup> The Nestle marketing is taking advantage of the “Let’s Move Cities, Towns and Counties” which is an initiative to engage mayors across the United States to improve nutrition and physical activity, using the campaign to spruce up its image as a good corporate citizen. Nestle’s efforts are not an actual part of this campaign; the company is just using it for image transfer. There is now a petition to encourage the mayor of Newark to end the relationship with Nestle that individuals may wish to sign.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412446373">3</xref></sup> Readers in the US may also want to find out whether local cities have been contacted by Nestle to participate in a similar arrangement.</p>
<p>2. In 2008, <italic>The Lancet</italic> issued a 5-part series on nutrition that provided evidence on the importance of nutrition during pregnancy and the first 2 years of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412446373">4</xref></sup> The series referred to this period of time as the first 1000 days, where the impact of a set of highly effective nutrition interventions focused on this special window of opportunity had the potential to affect lifelong health. These interventions, such as breastfeeding, have been shown internationally to save lives, reduce disease, and avoid irreversible harm. The evidence also shows that nutrition investments focused in the 1000-day window have extraordinary returns for long-term global health and prosperity. Nestle is joining with the <italic>Times of India</italic> to launch an initiative to promote optimal nutrition during those first 1000 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412446373">5,6</xref></sup> This initiative is at the same time that a Delhi court has charged Nestle India for violating the law in advertisements and labeling of its infant food products, including infant formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412446373">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. In 2010, Abbott Nutrition developed a program called Night Nurse Nation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412446373">8</xref></sup> to market their formula products to night nurses who may miss out on routine visits from formula salespeople during the day. The Web site offers continuing education, advice about working the night shift, materials on infant feeding for mothers, a phone number for Abbott’s infant feeding specialist, and of course, plenty of formula marketing.</p>
<p>4. Capitalizing on the reach of social media, formula and bottle companies are sponsoring Twitter parties called “Girls Night Out” hosted by Mom it Forward, a social media community. During these virtual parties, brand name sponsors provide information on selected topics, market their products, and provide prizes and giveaways. The maker of store brand formulas offered a Kindle Fire and $250 worth of store-brand formula during their Twitter party.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412446373">9</xref></sup> Between 250 and 500 people join these parties and are exposed to obviously biased information on infant feeding.</p>
<p>5. Because many mothers have a smart phone, Abbott has a free app that allows mothers to “see feeding duration graphs and important stats, such as average time between feedings, average amounts consumed, average duration, and total bottles.” It also permits mothers to email journal entries and reports to others such as their physician, access Abbott’s complete library of feeding tips and advice, and call a live Similac feeding expert. Abbott compensated a number of mommy bloggers to write positive reviews and recommend the use of Abbott’s iPhone and iPod Touch app.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412446373">10</xref></sup> Mead Johnson also has a mobile app for smart phones with access to “expert” advice, formula calculators, formula finders, nutrition tips, and a store locator of where to purchase their formula.</p>
<p>6. Personal recommendations drive many of the purchasing decisions of consumers. HouseParty.com provides a venue for companies to market their products through parties held in the homes of consumers. Mothers sign up to host a party for Gerber products, which are sent to the home of the hostess and distributed to guests. The hostess receives a box of products for herself and reports back to House Party on the success of the event. For a small investment, Nestle recruits mothers to market their products to other mothers, knowing that this process will result in the purchase of numerous other Gerber products besides infant formula.</p>
<p>Social media is blossoming into a gold mine for the marketing of infant formula. Social media includes such outlets as blogs, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and YouTube, all of which have been invaded by infant formula manufacturers seeking new tactics and venues to increase their market share. Testimonials from peers and within one’s social network often override science and common sense. Formula companies entice mothers into the company realm by offering discounts, coupons, prizes, special offers, contests, cash, and opportunities for interaction both with the company and with other mothers through company Web and social media sites. Users post comments and testimonials about how much they like the particular brand of formula and how well their baby does on it. This virtual interaction with other mothers gives the impression that “everyone” is happily using formula, and it has the potential to cement the thought that formula is good enough and that the expectation of “perfection” (breastfeeding) is nice, but no longer necessary.</p>
<p>Although formula companies are busy on the advertising front, they are also aware of increased scrutiny around corporate practices and public health. Just like tobacco companies and the processed food industry, the infant formula industry can be included in what public health advocates describe as “disease promoting corporations.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412446373">11</xref></sup> In order to bolster their image and reduce their offensiveness, these companies often ally or associate with entities of good reputation, such as governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Formula companies reframe the issue to deflect criticism away from themselves and onto others. They position themselves alongside health advocates, governmental agencies, and regulators, appearing to seek solutions by others to the health problems caused by their own products. They never admit that their products can cause harm, they simply shift the blame for these problems and shift responsibility for solving those problems onto the health care system or the communities in which these problems occur. As companies dodge their responsibilities for such things as truth in advertising, they seek to define themselves as stakeholders in repairing the consequences of their objectionable practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412446373">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus we come back to the new Nestle strategies to align with respectable public health initiatives. Advocates should not engage with the infant formula industry, as accepting infant formula companies as stakeholders plays into the industry’s strategy of divide and conquer. Cities, towns, and counties that allow Nestle to take a seat at obesity discussions and fund anti-obesity programs help burnish the image of a company whose products contribute to the cause of the problem. If Nestle really wanted to tackle obesity, it would stop its deceptive marketing practices of infant formula and produce healthier choices in food products.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we should beware of formula company-sponsored efforts to sit at the public health table. Cities, towns, and counties that accept funding from formula companies to cure the problems caused by these corporations does not address the underlying issue of poor corporate behavior. Government agencies and nongovernmental organizations can cease providing a forum for these companies by refusing to allow them to participate in public health campaigns or efforts. Nongovernmental organizations, health professional organizations, and health educators should refuse funding from companies who are not meeting their obligations under the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (the Code).</p>
