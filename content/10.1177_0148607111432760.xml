<abstract>
<p>The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) developed a Web-based registry for nutrition care launched in early 2011, initially focusing on the home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patient population. The purpose of Sustain is to collect information regarding the patients and populations who require HPN in the United States, measure outcomes associated with HPN, allow institutional benchmarking against the aggregate data, and publish the findings to improve the quality of care for patients receiving HPN. The registry is open to all sites (hospital and home based) who care for new or existing HPN patients. Preliminary data should be available in early 2012.</p>

<body>
<p>The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) is dedicated to improving patient care by advancing the science and practice of clinical nutrition and metabolism. Founded in 1976, A.S.P.E.N. is an interdisciplinary organization whose members are involved in the provision of clinical nutrition therapies, including parenteral nutrition (PN) and enteral nutrition (EN). With more than 5500 members from around the world, A.S.P.E.N. is a community of dietitians, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, scientists, students, and other health professionals from every facet of nutrition support clinical practice, research, and education. Nutrition support clinicians in the United States care for thousands of patients receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN), yet national data on numbers of patients, effectiveness, and safety of this therapy, as well as patient outcomes, remain undefined. A.S.P.E.N. developed Sustain™, A.S.P.E.N.’s National Patient Registry for Nutrition Care, to collect data on patients receiving nutrition support therapy. Sustain was launched in February 2011 to collect data for patients on HPN, with the overall goal of improving patient outcomes. The purpose of this article is to define registries, describe the development of the A.S.P.E.N. HPN registry, and explain the goals of Sustain and validation of the data collection tools.</p>
<sec id="section1-0148607111432760">
<title>Patient Registries</title>
<p><italic>Registries, repositories</italic>, and <italic>databases</italic> are terms used to describe a collection of clinical data associated with a specific disease state, condition, or procedure. Data can be collected prospectively or retrospectively to capture clinical events using a cross-sectional (eg, at initial diagnosis, or one hospitalization) or longitudinal (eg, data entered at several time points, including follow-up visits) approach. Data collected in a registry can be used to evaluate the epidemiology of disease states and treatment outcomes, as well as guide patient care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111432760">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111432760"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111432760"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111432760">4</xref></sup> Chronic disease-specific registries focus on patient management and the use of treatment guidelines to improve quality of care by targeting high-risk patients, whereas therapeutic registries collect data about patients who are ill or receiving a specific therapy to evaluate how treatment affects outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111432760">5</xref></sup> In addition, multisite, regional, or national registries serve to provide useful benchmarks as well as enable hypothesis generation for outcomes research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111432760">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2007, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) defined a patient registry as an organized system that uses observational study methods to collect uniform data (clinical and other) to evaluate specified outcomes for a population defined by a particular disease, condition, or exposure and that serves 1 or more predetermined scientific, clinical, or policy purpose(s).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111432760">6</xref></sup> The registry database is the file (or files) derived from the data collected by participants. Although registries can serve many purposes, AHRQ focused on registries that are created for 1 or more of the following purposes: to describe the natural history of disease, to determine clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of healthcare products and services, to measure or monitor safety and harm, and/or to measure quality of care. Registries are classified according to how the populations are defined. For example, health services registries consist of patients who have had a common procedure, clinical encounter, or hospitalization, whereas disease or condition registries are defined by patients having the same diagnosis, such as cystic fibrosis or heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111432760">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In its landmark report, <italic>Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century</italic>, the Institute of Medicine’s recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111432760">7</xref></sup> for improving healthcare included making healthcare safer, more effective, patient centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. Data collected in disease-, condition-, or procedure-centered registries could help to promote quality and improve healthcare by identifying patient needs and values, promote evidence-based decision making, anticipate future health care trends and needs, and promote a need for transparency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111432760">7</xref></sup> Although a registry is not needed for every disease, condition, or procedure, those that are high risk, high-volume, and/or high expenditure should be captured in a registry to improve quality.</p>
<p>Individual institutions, regional alliances, or professional organizations, such as the American Burn Association’s National Burn Repository<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111432760">2</xref></sup> or the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) National Database,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111432760">4</xref></sup> have developed and maintained registries for the purpose of evaluating patient outcomes. The STS National Database was established in 1989 as an initiative for quality improvement and patient safety among cardiothoracic surgeons. The database has grown exponentially over the years, both in terms of participation and stature. The STS has developed quality performance measures, and these measures either have been endorsed or are in the process of being considered for endorsement by the National Quality Forum. By collecting outcomes data for submission to the STS National Database, surgeons are committing to improving the quality of care that their cardiothoracic surgery patients receive. The database has the corollary potential to be a powerful tool for clinical research. Since its inception, more than 100 publications have been derived from database outcomes. These studies have been published in a variety of professional journals and have significantly advanced knowledge in cardiothoracic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111432760">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111432760"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111432760">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the mid-to-late 1980s, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) came under a great deal of public scrutiny over the quality of surgical care in its 133 VA hospitals. At issue were the operative mortality rates in the VA hospitals and the perception in Congress that these rates were significantly above the national (private sector) norm. To address the gap, Congress passed a law that mandated the VA to report its surgical outcomes annually based on a risk-adjusted basis to factor in a patient’s severity of illness and compare them to national averages. The only problem was that these “national averages” did not exist, so with its advanced information systems and centralized authority and organization of hospitals, the VA realized it was in a unique position to create these data models. As a result, the VA embarked upon the National VA Surgical Risk Study (NVASRS) in 44 VA medical centers, later to be called the VA National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111432760">11</xref></sup> Between 1991 and 2001, this VA NSQIP demonstrated a 27% decline in postoperative mortality and a 45% decline in postoperative morbidity, postoperative length of stay fell from 9 to 4 days, and patient satisfaction improved. Later, nonfederal hospitals and the American College of Surgeons became involved, and this model is now used nationally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111432760">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>HPN</title>
<p>PN is the intravenous (IV) administration of nutrients delivered into a large-diameter vein (usually the superior vena cava) or peripheral vein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111432760">12</xref></sup> PN is indicated in patients who cannot, should not, or will not eat adequately to maintain their nutrient stores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111432760">13</xref></sup> and who either are or have the potential for developing significant malnutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111432760">14</xref></sup> HPN has allowed patients with intestinal failure a life-saving option, and some individuals have survived for more than 30 years on this therapy. Intestinal failure results from obstruction, dysmotility, surgical resection, congenital defect, or disease-associated loss of absorption and is characterized by the inability to maintain protein-energy, fluid, electrolyte, or micronutrient balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111432760">14</xref></sup> HPN is indicated when the need for PN is &gt;2 weeks and the patient no longer requires hospitalization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607111432760">15</xref></sup> HPN patients must meet certain criteria to be eligible for reimbursement under current Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines and most insurance plans. These criteria include documentation that the patient’s gastrointestinal (GI) tract is nonfunctional; the condition is permanent, requiring at least 90 days of treatment; and the patient is unable to tolerate enteral feeding (eg, presence of malabsorption or obstruction).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607111432760">15</xref></sup> To receive HPN, patients generally use the services of a home infusion care company that provides nursing, pharmacy, and dietetic services, along with durable medical equipment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607111432760">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1966, the first hospitalized patient in the United States received PN, and in 1968, the first patient was discharged on HPN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607111432760">17</xref></sup> In the years that followed, there was growth in the use of HPN nationwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607111432760">18</xref></sup> In 1976, reimbursement became available under Medicare through the prosthetic device benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607111432760">19</xref></sup> and soon after by private insurance companies. In 1983, the Oley Foundation was established as an organization whose focus was to share information and support for HPN and EN consumers.</p>
<p>Currently in the United States, little is known about the annual utilization of HPN. Medicare, the largest payer for HPN and EN, does not generate specific public access reports on this patient population. The most recent published data from 2002 estimated that 39,000 people received HPN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607111432760">16</xref></sup> This estimate was based on home care infusion therapy databases and did not represent the entire U.S. population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111432760">20</xref></sup> HPN is a high-risk, high-expenditure procedure, estimated to cost $75,000–$150,000 per patient year, in 1991 U.S. dollars.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111432760">21</xref></sup> In addition, this therapy is high risk considering PN-related morbidity and mortality. Patients requiring HPN may receive therapy for only a few months or a lifetime. At present, a national registry in the United States does not exist to record how many patients receive HPN, patient characteristics, diagnoses, or geographic patterns to evaluate the effectiveness and outcomes of this life-sustaining therapeutic procedure that provides sustenance to individuals who cannot be nourished through their GI tract.</p>

<title>HPN Patient Registries</title>
<p>In 1976, the American College of Surgeons and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded a registry to collect data on the growing numbers of patients on HPN, as part of the Organ Transplant Registry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607111432760">22</xref></sup> The Home TPN Registry was transferred to the New York Academy of Medicine in 1977 under the direction of Dr Maurice Shils. Through this voluntary national registry, clinicians began contributing data for HPN patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111432760">23</xref></sup> This registry was limited because it reported aggregate data, and not all patients discharged home on PN were included in the registry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111432760">23</xref></sup> In 1984, a second voluntary patient registry was developed to track the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of home patients in the United States and Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111432760">21</xref></sup> The registry, called OASIS (Oley–A.S.P.E.N. Information System), was a joint effort of the Oley Foundation and A.S.P.E.N. and existed from 1985–1992. In 1992, the registry changed its name to the North American Home Parenteral and Enteral (HPEN) Patient Registry and was under the sole direction of the Oley Foundation. The prevalence of HPN during that time was 238 patients per million people in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607111432760">24</xref></sup> This registry collected data provided voluntarily by clinicians, leading to variation in reporting and interpretation of data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111432760">20</xref></sup> The registry stopped collecting data because it used paper data collection tools and became too costly to maintain. Yearly results of the registry were tabulated and analyzed with the last published data from 1994. The 1985–1992 report is available at the Oley Foundation Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oley.org">www.oley.org</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Once the North American HPEN Patient Registry ceased to collect data, there was a void in the scientific literature regarding U.S. HPN patient outcomes. Researchers began to look at outcomes from clinical databases used by home care providers or individual institutions to capture uniform clinical information to evaluate HPN patient outcomes. Limitations to this approach were the numerous home nutrition support providers in the United States and the difficulty ensuring uniform data collection from the variety of electronic clinical data systems. In 2000, a large medical center reported retrospective data over 6 years from more than 300 patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607111432760">25</xref></sup> In 2005, a retrospective report was published by a single large national home infusion company evaluating the home care use and clinical outcomes of patients receiving HPN in 72 branch locations between 1997 and 2001.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111432760">20</xref></sup> The findings from this large, 5-year retrospective study provided the most current evidence on which to benchmark practice patterns in the United States. This registry reported that an average of 4560 patients per year received HPN, with an average length of therapy of 100 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111432760">20</xref></sup> Although these reports provide retrospective glimpses of HPN care, little is known about the exact incidence, prevalence, and outcomes of HPN in the United States in the past 10 years. The Sustain registry will provide a Web-based, national approach to allow all providers of HPN to participate, thus allowing inclusion of patients from all regions and health systems.</p>
<p>Although researchers and clinicians in the United States played a pivotal role as leaders in the development of PN, the United States lags behind our international counterparts in the development of contemporary HPN registries. The Spanish Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition’s registry, called NADYA, has been in existence since 1992, with over 17 centers reporting on at least 5 patients per center.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607111432760">26</xref></sup> Scotland,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607111432760">27</xref></sup> New Zealand,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607111432760">28</xref></sup> Australia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.auspen.org.au">www.auspen.org.au</ext-link>), and most recently Canada<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607111432760">29</xref></sup> have national HPN registries. In a 2007 publication, the Canadian HPN registry harvested data from 9 of the largest HPN providers in Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607111432760">29</xref></sup> The most recent HPN data are provided by the Australian registry, called the AuSPEN HPN Register (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.auspen.org.au">www.auspen.org.au</ext-link>). The November 2009 summary reported on HPN patients from Australia (except the Northern Territory) and New Zealand and included 81 adults and 34 children. This registry reports inclusion of an estimated 95% of all adults and children receiving HPN in these countries.</p>
<p>HPN registries available in other countries provide invaluable information regarding incidence, prevalence, and outcomes of HPN therapy, as demonstrated by the Canadian registry, which found that HPN is associated with significant complications and healthcare utilization. These findings support the use of a registry such as Sustain to better define the HPN population and monitor for quality control and outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607111432760">29</xref></sup> In a 2008 comparison study between HPN registries, New Zealand and Scotland found differences in HPN utilization despite similar incidence of underlying disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607111432760">28</xref></sup> It appears that the United States is a major user of HPN as compared to patients worldwide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607111432760">29</xref></sup> yet a systematic approach to capture data related to incidence, prevalence, and outcomes of this high-risk, high-cost therapy has not yet been in place. Most of the international HPN registries are managed by the professional society for PN and EN in that country. Therefore, it was critical that A.S.P.E.N. develop and maintain a registry to track HPN demographics and care to develop best practice guidelines and improve patient outcomes.</p>

<title>Sustain Mission and Goals</title>
<p>The mission of the Sustain is to maintain a prospective, longitudinal nutrition therapy patient registry to improve patient outcomes.

<title>Sustain Councils</title>
<p>Sustain was developed by an A.S.P.E.N. presidential-appointed task force. Sustain was then incorporated as a member-managed limited liability corporation (LLC) that answers directly to the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. The governance then transitioned to an executive council with 2 advisory councils (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111432760">Figure 1</xref>). An executive council assumes responsibility for the major financial, administrative, legal/ethical, and scientific decisions that determine the direction of the registry. The A.S.P.E.N. president appointed an Executive Council with a chairman who will serve as an oversight and ultimate decision-making body, answerable to the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. This Executive Council has 7 members, including a chairman. A consumer/patient also serves as a participant on this board. This council must include 1–2 members, including a chair from each of the boards listed below.</p>

<title>Scientific Advisory Council</title>
<p>A scientific advisory council function may include experts ranging from database content, to general clinical research, to epidemiology and biostatistics. It is strongly desirable that the reports that emerge from a registry be scientifically based analyses that are independent and transparent. To enhance credibility and in the interest of full disclosure, the role of all stakeholders in the management and publication processes should be specified and any potential conflicts of interest identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111432760">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sustain scientific oversight is conducted by the Scientific Advisory Council. This council has 1–2 members from the Executive Council and 7 members, including a chairman, to guide this council. The following functions are under the purview of this group: institutional and patient recruitment, institutional review board (IRB) material development, data integrity, quality improvement/benchmarking reports, scientific queries, data and proposal requests, abstracts, and publications. Full protocols for each of these processes are in development.</p>

<title>Operations Advisory Council</title>
<p>Sustain management is conducted by the Operations Advisory Council. This council has 1–2 members from the Executive Council and has 7 members with a chairman. The following functions are under the purview of this group: fundraising, vendor and staff management, data safety, reports generation, IRB/institutional management, marketing-communication, and meeting planning. Full protocols for each of these processes are in development.</p>
<p>In large registries, a function may be specified to focus on maintaining relationships with the funding source, healthcare providers, and patients who use the database. The group serving this function may develop monitoring and satisfaction tools to ensure that the day-to-day operations of the registry remain healthy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111432760">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Registry Design and Methods</title>
<p>Sustain uses a prospective, longitudinal cohort design to collect data for adult and pediatric patients initially discharged from the hospital and existing patients already on HPN with follow-up on a periodic basis. All of the information resides in a data server maintained through Sustain. Sustain is to ensure the integrity of the data and provide the means to have data extracted and analyzed upon request according to preexisting policies and procedures, privacy and confidentiality regulations, and good clinical practice guidelines. A.S.P.E.N. believes that by establishing a national registry, the needs of the HPN patient population can be better analyzed and understood. The data are available to a variety of stakeholders upon request, but Sustain is the sole curator of the database to maintain its integrity and independence.</p>
<p>Clinicians from hospitals or home infusion providers are designated as site investigators (SIs) and users. Once IRB approval is obtained, each center formally enrolls in the Sustain program and prospectively enters data on HPN patients. Data are obtained at baseline, which is defined in new HPN patients as the time of hospital discharge and/or home care admission and with existing patients as the time when the clinician enrolls the patient. Each patient is followed longitudinally, with periodic follow-up data entered into the registry at regular intervals. Each center or site (hospital, home infusion provider, or medical group) will receive an aggregate report of its own patients and a benchmark comparison to the total pooled data. The registry site participants collect the data elements at baseline, followed by monthly and quarterly, depending on how often new HPN patients are seen for follow-up. For existing patients, data collection occurs after routine office visits or at least annually. Patients receiving PN in long-term care or other institutional settings or those receiving intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN) are currently excluded from the registry. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607111432760">Table 3</xref> for Sustain data elements. Types of research questions that the Scientific Advisory Council has put forth include those found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148607111432760">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<title>Data Collection Tool Validation</title>
<p>The HPN data collection tool was developed in 2008 by the Home Parenteral Nutrition Database Task Force. This interdisciplinary group reviewed the literature and current clinical practices to identify the major data element domains (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607111432760">Table 3</xref>). Individual items were developed, and the expert panel went through several rounds of review to ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency. To test feasibility and establish content validity of the data collection tools, the data elements of both the baseline and follow-up tools were sent to U.S.-based A.S.P.E.N. members along with a short survey in early 2009. The survey and tools were sent to hospital-based and home infusion–based clinicians. Three hundred seventy-four clinicians completed the survey. When asked how long it would take to complete either the baseline or follow-up collection sheet, 55% of respondents reported that it would take less than 30 minutes. When asked if they or their staff could complete these data collection tools for their patients at least quarterly or upon re-hospitalization, 77% reported that they could, at least for some of their patients. If they reported no, they were asked why not. Of those who reported no, 82% stated that staffing constraints would prevent them from participating and 9% anticipated administrative lack of support.</p>
<p>Survey participants were asked if they would delete any of the data elements, and they reported a few. Those elements that were consistently noted were considered for removal and the data collection tools modified. Likewise, participants were asked to suggest other data elements not previously considered, and with those elements frequently mentioned, the data collection tools were modified. When asked for any further comments, the participants expressed concern over the length of time to complete the data collection tools. The Scientific Advisory Council responded to this concern by identifying critical data elements that the participants are strongly encouraged to complete. These elements will be analyzed for completeness and further refined in the future.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0148607111432760">
<title>Patient Protection</title>
<p>In accordance with federal regulations and institutional policies, research or research procedures (eg, potential research subject identification and recruitment) involving the use of patient-specific medical record information may require the prior written informed consent (aka authorization) of the respective patients. Patients seen at each clinical setting or site (hospital or home care company) who are on HPN will be asked to provide their written informed consent (authorization), unless the IRB waives the need for signed informed consent. In that case, a waiver of informed consent information sheet will be given to each enrolled patient. Patients will be informed that Sustain will only collect de-identified information; their names and other Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)–designated patient identifiers will not be entered into the registry. This constitutes a limited data set. Because concurrent medical conditions and treatments (ie, not related directly to HPN therapy) may substantially affect the patients’ HPN therapy, it is likely that all of the patients’ past, current, and future medical record information will be reviewed and appropriate de-identified information will be placed in Sustain.</p>
<p>Patient medical information will be stored electronically within the registry. The patient identifiers (names and medical record numbers) of the registry participants will be known by the site clinician but blinded from Sustain, and a study identification code will be assigned. Information linking the study codes to the participants’ names and medical record numbers will be stored in a secure location at the site separate from the medical information and will not be transmitted to the Sustain database or A.S.P.E.N. Access to the information linking the patient codes with participant names and medical record numbers will be granted only to the SI or their designee and kept in a locked cabinet at the site. Access to the information linking these study codes with participant identifiers will be documented by the site. De-identified participant medical record information will be stored in Sustain for an indefinite period of time.</p>
<p>The Sustain Scientific Advisory Council will review and approve as appropriate all requests to use the aggregate data for quality improvement studies or research studies being conducted by individual clinical sites. Such approvals shall be obtained prior to providing investigator access to the registry information, based on considerations of scientific quality and validity, granted only for research studies related to HPN, and documented. Access of SIs to the registry for the purpose of performing approved retrospective research studies shall be documented. Participant medical record information contained within the registry may be provided to secondary research investigators as de-indentified data (ie, research investigators who are not affiliated with the clinical site or A.S.P.E.N.) with the permission of the Sustain Scientific Advisory Council. Sustain shall require secondary investigators to obtain IRB approval of an “exempt” research application prior to its provision of de-identified information to the secondary investigator and will require each secondary investigator to sign a data use agreement with Sustain. Patients will not be informed of the results of retrospective research studies involving the use of their medical record information contained within Sustain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0148607111432760">
<title>Human Subjects Issues</title>
<p>Individuals to be approached for participation in Sustain will include all children and adult patients who are on HPN. Parental or guardian consent will be obtained for children unless waived by an IRB. Assent will be obtained as appropriate. Because of the complexity of state and federal requirements governing the participation of prisoners in research, prisoner-patients shall not be approached for participation in the registry. Because participation in the registry does not involve a risk of physical harm, women of childbearing potential will not be queried as to pregnancy status or tested for pregnancy. The racial, gender, and ethnic characteristics of the individuals approached for participation in this registry shall reflect the demographics of patients receiving or seeking medical care at the clinical setting. Sustain shall attempt to recruit participants in accordance with these demographics. No individuals shall be excluded from participation in the registry based on race, ethnicity, gender, or HIV status.</p>
<p>There are no risks of physical harm associated with participation in the Sustain registry. Participation in this registry does involve the potential risks of a breach of confidentiality of the medical record information and associated privacy of the patients. Such risks will be minimized by (1) blinding direct participant identifiers (ie, names, medical record numbers) from information stored in the registry such that the registry contains only a “Limited Data Set” as defined by HIPAA; (2) securing, in a separate location at the participating site, and limiting access to information study codes assigned to the registry information with direct participant identifiers; and (3) limiting access to information contained within the registry to SI and Sustain staff and investigators.</p>
<p>The data and safety monitoring plan for the registry will involve routine (ie, quarterly) monitoring by Sustain A.S.P.E.N.’s Operations Advisory Council or designee of (1) the blinding of direct identifiers from information contained with the registry, (2) the documentation of investigator access to the registry, (3) the security of the database linking the registry study codes with patient identifiers and the documentation of investigator access to this database, and (4) any conditions that may negatively affect the confidentiality of information contained within the registry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0148607111432760">
<title>Data Quality Management</title>
<p>Each site coordinator will be trained to use the database by the Sustain registry coordinator using training videos, a live webinar, and a user manual, thus presenting a consistent message for data collection. Data will be periodically reviewed for missing data, erroneous data, and completion of all forms. The Scientific Advisory Council will review the data periodically to assess the level of completion and identify elements that are of concern. Sites are supported by the registry coordinator and by a Sustain users group, organized using the social media of A.S.P.E.N. Connect. Users will also be invited to attend a session at the Clinical Nutrition Week meeting and incentivized by nonmonetary awards. Serial data reports will be sent to the sites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0148607111432760">
<title>Costs and Payments</title>
<p>All costs associated with the implementation and maintenance of the registry shall be supported by Sustain and funding sources recruited by the same. No direct costs will be incurred by registry patients. Unlike many registries, the sites will not be asked to contribute payment to participate in the registry. Healthcare providers will need to do the recruitment and enter data, so labor cost associated with this activity shall be borne by the healthcare provider’s institution or practice. Patients will not be remunerated for their participation in the registry. A fee may be requested if an external organization makes a request for data use and they are not participants. The data reports will not be used for commercial marketing purposes according to the Participant Use Agreement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0148607111432760">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A.S.P.E.N. has developed an HPN registry that will include new and existing patient data for analysis. Periodic data reports will be generated for participating sites that will include demographic data and HPN therapy and patient outcomes. The goal is to capture 100% of HPN patients in the United States. Findings generated from Sustain data could be used to influence public policy decisions as well as being able to benchmark best practices. This registry has the potential to benefit future patients as we enter into an era of many unknowns due to healthcare reform changes. Information about the registry and participation in Sustain can be obtained at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nutritioncare.org/sustain">www.nutritioncare.org/sustain</ext-link>. Data regarding enrollment, findings, and HPN-related outcomes will be presented at future Clinical Nutrition Week meetings and submitted for publication.</p>
