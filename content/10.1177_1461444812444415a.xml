<p>Anandam Kavoori’s book joins the growing literature on YouTube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444812444415">Burgess and Green, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444812444415">Snickars and Vonderau, 2009</xref>), the world’s largest video-sharing site. Coming to an ‘understanding’ of YouTube has challenged scholars given the site’s vast size – 48 hours of video are uploaded every minute – and its ever-changing nature. Kavoori answers the question ‘How does one get one’s hands around the texts of YouTube?’ (pp. 1–2) with a methodology for reading YouTube videos as stories, or myths. Originating from an undergraduate class, the book includes pedagogical exercises for using YouTube as a jumping-off point to discuss genre, participatory culture, and ideology, and a guide to the most prominent videos and genres on the site.</p>
<p>The introduction lays out Kavoori’s method for analyzing online video. Much current scholarship on digital culture follows an anthropological model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444812444415">Coleman, 2010</xref>), investigating active audiences, situating digital media use within specific contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444812444415">Miller and Slater, 2000</xref>), or positioning content creators within broader fannish cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444812444415">Jenkins, 2006</xref>). In contrast, Kavoori positions the videos as texts within the larger architecture of YouTube. He suggests examining the primary video (‘Foundationality’), the surrounding videos (‘Referentiality’), and the comments (‘Participatory’) in order to ‘read’ a video’s story and determine its genre (p. 5–6). Like many media scholars, Kavoori is concerned with impact, but argues that YouTube makes it difficult to use reception theory to understand ‘content, interaction, and subjectivity’ (p. 9) because YouTube videos are mobile, polysemic, and intertextual. As a result, Kavoori aims to determine what he calls the ‘participatory closure’ of each text, ‘a process whereby there emerges a specific modality of reception around a video or person, which in effect ‘closes off’ alternate or completely open-ended modes of interpretation’ (p. 11).</p>
<p>In the remaining two-thirds of the book, Kavoori uses these methods to describe and read YouTube videos, grouped by theme (music, childhood, and so forth). These interpretations are Kavoori’s own, although he occasionally draws from external media sources and the comments and feedback on each video, which he refers to as ‘participatory culture.’ Most videos are categorized as examples of the ‘Phenom,’ the mechanism of online popularity also referred to as ‘micro-celebrity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444812444415">Senft, 2008</xref>). The ‘Icons’ chapter, for instance, focuses on very famous YouTube stars, from <italic>Star Wars Kid</italic> to <italic>Tron Guy</italic> to Tay Zonday of <italic>Chocolate Rain</italic>. Kavoori distinguishes these online celebrities from conventional celebrity along three axes: remediation, scale, and intertextuality. He argues that phenoms often borrow or rework elements of mainstream popular culture; they are small in scale but represent larger social issues; and frequently reference other genres, memes, and discourses (p. 27).</p>
<p>While the book’s interpretations and descriptions of iconic YouTube videos are interesting, the themes of remediation, scale, and intertextuality could be better interwoven. Arguably, media convergence and digital promotion have merged the line between ‘traditional’ and ‘online’ celebrity, and a better case could be made for digital exceptionalism. How do the mechanisms of user-generated content and participation, for instance, impact the popularity of phenoms? Ultimately, the readings seem disconnected, and the lack of a conclusion makes it difficult to ascertain the ideological threads and connections that Kavoori is attempting to make. In claiming that each video has a closure, Kavoori justifies textual analysis, but fails to explore the implications of polysemic and intertextual media: that they will be understood differently by diverse populations and audiences.</p>
<p>The book closes with a strong selection of potential student exercises. Kavoori chose the videos in tandem with his students; he rightly points out that YouTube, and indeed a lot of popular memes and viral videos, is ultimately about <italic>youth</italic> culture (p. 4). (He disclaims that the book focuses on ‘the kind of narratives that were popular . . . among white students at a university in the South’ (p. 19).) Kavoori argues that teaching new media and digital culture provides rich opportunities for student involvement in learning and content creation. In a media criticism class, for instance, asking students to analyze the architecture, use, and impact of YouTube videos would be a valuable exercise, and compensate for the relative dearth of material on reading digital media, in contrast to the body of theory around television and film. Given that young people consume an enormous amount of online video, teaching new media literacy beyond information credibility or representation is important and necessary.</p>
<p>This book will be useful to other media scholars who use textual analysis, but would be stronger if a greater justification could be given for choosing this approach over other qualitative or quantitative research methods. The lack of economic analysis is particularly problematic; if we accept ‘participatory closure,’ we must assume that some of these preferred readings are influenced by the business model of the site, which promotes some genres over others and condones some aspects of participatory culture while discouraging others. <italic>Reading YouTube</italic> also demonstrates some of the challenges in studying enormous user-generated content sites like Facebook, Wikipedia, and YouTube. How does one categorize mimetic genres when they are unstable and constantly changing? Recent sensations like Rebecca Black’s <italic>Friday, Double Rainbow</italic>, or Antoine Dodson’s <italic>Bed Intruder Song</italic> may not fit into Kavoori’s taxonomy. Moreover, some of the trends in this book are passé, and some of the videos forgotten. Ultimately, the goal of digital scholarship should be to set down theories and principles that can be used to analyze future content; the real value of this work is not in the readings, but in laying out a method for textual analysis of user-generated content. Without such principles, all internet scholars are in thrall to constantly moving targets.</p>
