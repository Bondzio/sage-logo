<abstract>
<p>The quality of surface is one of the significant parameters which affects the life and functionality of any product. Many products require nano-level surface finish as their functional indispensability. Those processes having flexible finishing tool can be employed for such type of components. These finishing processes can be classified into two categories: with and without magnetic field assistance. The former includes magnetic abrasive finishing, magnetorheological finishing, and allied processes, and the latter includes abrasive flow finishing. This article reports the critical review of mainly three processes: abrasive flow finishing, magnetorheological finishing, and magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing. In this article, the issues that need attention of the researchers have been categorically mentioned. This article provides a comprehensive literature review of magnetorheological finishing process in terms of rheological characterization of magnetorheological fluid, experimental investigation, theoretical analysis, and applications. This article deals with various advancements in abrasive flow finishing and hybrid processes. The developments in magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing and its allied processes have been discussed in detail. By suitable modification of magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing process, it can achieve surface finish up to nano-meter on different materials such as brass, aluminium, stainless steel, and silicon-nitride.</p>

<title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>In the era of nanotechnology, high precision finishing methods are of utmost importance, and they are the need of present day manufacturing industries. There are noteworthy developments in high technology industries such as electronics, automobile, medical, and aviation, where the focus is to increase precision of the products at micro-/nano-scale to perform certain functions. Many products exist in the market where highest level of surface finish is necessary to increase their life and performance. Some of them are silicon in IC industries, micro-channels in micro-fluidics, optics and free-form surfaces in medical science, and moving assembly such as piston-cylinder and bearings in automobile. The traditional finishing processes alone are incapable of producing the required surface characteristics to meet the demand of nanotechnology. Many components require high level of surface finish to reduce fluid flow resistance, friction, and optical losses. Fatigue strength of a component is also affected by surface conditions. Usually, a surface finish improvement operation is required during or after fabrication of a part. Abrasive-based traditional finishing processes, such as grinding, honing, and lapping, are not capable of producing ultrafine surface on three-dimensional (3D) complex-shaped components and very hard material components due to the abrasives in the bonded form and high specific cutting energy requirement. Therefore, loose abrasive finishing processes, such as chemo-mechanical polishing/planarization, abrasive flow finishing (AFF), and magnetic field-assisted finishing processes, are preferable over the traditional finishing processes. However, many finishing processes, such as lapping, chemo-mechanical polishing, and AFF, are not deterministic in nature because the abrading forces acting on the workpiece are not externally controllable by other means such as magnetic field.</p>
<p>In this article, AFF, magnetorheological finishing (MRF), and magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing (MRAFF) processes have been reviewed. The performance of the first one cannot be externally controlled whereas the performance of the other two can be controlled in-process by changing the magnetic field intensity. The beauty of all these processes is that they can finish complex-shaped 3D components apart from finishing of inaccessible areas and miniature features.</p>

<title>2 MAGNETORHEOLOGICAL FINISHING</title>
<p>MRF is a magnetic field-assisted precision finishing process developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211426948">
<bold>1</bold>
</xref>] and commercialized by QED Technologies, Inc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211426948">
<bold>2</bold>
</xref>]. MRF has revolutionized the way optics is being made and it has gained broad acceptance by most of the world’s leading optics industries. MRF has been used for finishing a large variety of brittle materials ranging from optical glasses to hard crystals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211426948">
<bold>3</bold>
</xref>]. This process utilizes magnetorheological polishing (MRP) fluid to polish different kinds of materials. MRP fluid consists of magnetic carbonyl iron particles (CIPs) and non-magnetic abrasive particles (NMAPs), water or other carrier liquid, and surfactant. The MRP fluid forms a conformal polishing tool and therefore it can polish a variety of shapes, including flat, convex, and concave. With an appropriate combination of MRP fluid and other finishing parameters, it has successfully polished a variety of materials to sub-nanometer surface roughness value.</p>
<p>In the absence of magnetic field, the MR fluid behaves as a Newtonian viscous fluid. The magnetic field stiffens the MRP fluid ribbon depending upon the field strength and it behaves like a visco-plastic fluid. Magnetic field and CIPs are necessary to produce magnetorheological (MR) effect while NMAPs are responsible for material removal in MRF process. Magnetic particles are uniformly dispersed when there is no magnetic field, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211426948">Fig. 1(a)</xref>. On the application of magnetic field, CIPs are attracted towards the magnet and create a chain-like structure along the lines of the magnetic field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211426948">Fig. 1(b)</xref>). When NMAPs are added in the MRP fluid, they are gripped by the magnetic particles chains, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211426948">Fig. 1(c)</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-0954406211426948" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Distribution of magnetic particles (a) without magnetic field, (b) with magnetic field, and (c) NMAPs (deliberately chosen of much bigger size for this photograph) embedded in the magnetic particles chains</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211426948-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
</p>
<p>In the MRF process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211426948">Fig. 2(a)</xref>), a convex, flat, or concave workpiece is positioned below a rotating carrier wheel. A ribbon is formed on the carrier wheel by the MRP fluid delivered by the nozzle. Two MRP fluid pumps (peristaltic or centrifugal) are used for delivery and suction of MR fluid from the carrier wheel. By applying magnetic field using an electromagnet or a permanent magnet, the stiffened MR fluid forms a finishing spot at the ribbon–workpiece interface during finishing. A fluid conditioning and storage system is used to control MRP fluid temperature, to prevent sedimentation of solids through stirring of MRP fluid, and to monitor/add water which is lost by evaporation during finishing operation. Material removal takes place due to the interaction between the stiffened MR fluid and workpiece when the MR fluid ribbon is dragged into the converging gap (finishing zone) by rotating carrier wheel. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211426948">Figure 2(b)</xref> shows a magnified view of mechanics of material removal during MRF process, showing normal and tangential forces responsible for penetration and shearing of peaks during finishing, respectively.

</p>
<p>Majority of the work reported in the literature is experimental in nature in which different configurations of the machine setup are developed depending on the size and the shape of the workpiece to be finished, whereas some researchers have studied this process theoretically in which the models are developed for evaluating material removal and forces acting on the workpiece surface. This article reviews these aspects of the MRF process along with rheological characterization of MRP fluid.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0954406211426948">
<title>2.1 Rheological characterization of MR fluid for MRF process</title>
<p>Rheological characterization includes the study of yield stress, viscosity, and temperature of MR fluid with or without the application of magnetic field. Majority of the reported work related to the study of rheological properties of MR fluid uses MR fluid where no NMAPs are added to it. Such MR fluid is used in brakes, clutches, dampers, etc. Only a few researchers have reported the rheological characterization of MR fluid with NMAPs, as discussed in the following sections.</p>
<p>Shorey <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211426948">
<bold>4</bold>
</xref>] designed and tested a magnetorheometer for studying yield stress and viscosity of MRP fluids. The yield stress is found as a function of CIPs concentration and magnetic field intensity. Huang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211426948">
<bold>5</bold>
</xref>] developed a theoretical model for yield stress to analyse the effect of magnetic field on the MR fluid having no NMAPs. However, the study of the effect of other parameters, such as size and concentration of NMAPs, size of CIPs, and temperature of MRP fluid, is necessary from MRF process point of view.</p>
<p>It is found that the magnetic susceptibility of MR fluid increases with the increase in magnetic particle size as well as concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211426948">
<bold>6</bold>
</xref>]. Structural changes, including particles organization such as translation, aggregation, and chaining, occurring in the MR fluid during use lead to susceptibility drift and may affect fluid performance. Nevertheless, the reported results are only useful to study the size effect of CIPs in the case of MRF process. Sidpara <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211426948">
<bold>7</bold>
</xref>] investigated the effect of CIPs concentration, NMAPs concentration, magnetic field, and water concentration on yield stress and viscosity of MRP fluid. Magnetic field is found as the most significant factor which affects both yield stress and viscosity. The MR fluid rheological curves are fitted with well-known visco-plastic fluids models such as Herschel–Bulkley, Bingham Plastic, and Casson fluid. It is found that Herschel–Bulkley model fits better with the experimental results compared to Bingham Plastic and Casson fluid models, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211426948">Fig. 3</xref>. Study of other parameters, such as temperature, size of CIPs, as well as NMAPs, is required as an extension of the reported work.
<fig id="fig3-0954406211426948" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Fitting of MR fluid rheology curves by visco-plastic fluid models</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211426948-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
</p>
<p>Sidpara and Jain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211426948">
<bold>8</bold>
</xref>] studied the effect of MRP fluid composition on finishing single-crystal silicon. An experimental study is conducted with oil- and water-based MR fluids with the addition of NMAPs: aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>). It is found that MRP fluid having CeO<sub>2</sub> and water is more effective for nano-finishing of silicon. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211426948">Figure 4</xref> shows atomic force microscope images of unfinished and finished silicon surfaces having 10 nm surface roughness obtained by MRF process with CeO<sub>2</sub> and water-based MR fluid. The results of rheological study show that yield stress of oil-based MRP fluid is lower than the water-based one. It is also found that the yield stress and viscosity of MRP fluid decrease with its use due to contamination with the removed material in the form of micro-/nano-chips. Therefore, MRP fluid should be periodically conditioned/changed during finishing operation.
<fig id="fig4-0954406211426948" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>AFM image of (a) unfinished (<italic>R</italic>

</fig>
</p>
<p>Based on the above literature review, it is concluded that hardly any report is available with emphasis on improving the stability of MRP fluid used in MRF process. Reuse and storage of MRP fluid are very difficult because its rheological properties decay (especially in the case of water-based MRP fluid) when it is stored for a longtime. Therefore, long-term stability of MRP fluid is one of the prime issues which needs to be addressed.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0954406211426948">
<title>2.2 Experimental investigations</title>
<p>The experimental investigations in MRF process include design and fabrication of different types of setups as per the workpiece requirements, study of effect of process parameters on the responses, synthesis of effective MR fluid in terms of MRR, surface finish, etc. Tani and Kawata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211426948">
<bold>9</bold>
</xref>] developed a polishing method and named as ‘Magnetic float polishing’. The magnetic fluid consists of a ferro-colloid magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and silicon carbide as NMAPs in the carrier liquid (eicosyl naphthalene). The theory of magnetic levitation of NMAPs is described and it is concluded that the finishing is performed by the scratching mechanism rather than the rolling one. Kurobe and Imanaka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211426948">
<bold>10</bold>
</xref>] developed a polishing method which uses electromagnet for energizing magnetic fluid. It is found that the pulse magnetic field has higher material removal than the static one. It is also reported that the small size NMAPs give higher material removal rate (MRR) and finishing rate (FR) (nm/s) compared to bigger size NMAPs. Suzuki <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211426948">
<bold>11</bold>
</xref>] demonstrated a method for finishing curved workpiece (single-crystal LiNbO<sub>3</sub>) by magnetic field-assisted finishing process. When colloidal silica is used as NMAPs, surface roughness of 10 nm, <italic>R</italic>
<sub>max</sub>, has been obtained. Forming of MRP fluid into a ribbon and maintaining fluid properties (e.g. apparent viscosity, temperature, and homogeneity) are the most critical factors in MRF process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211426948">
<bold>12</bold>
</xref>].</p>
<p>Jacobs <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211426948">
<bold>13</bold>
</xref>] reported the removal of asymmetric figure errors during MRF. Surface roughness of ∼1 nm has been achieved with FR between 16.67 and 166.67 nm/s, which seems to be quite high. A method of sedimentation measurement is demonstrated by Kordonski and Golini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211426948">
<bold>14</bold>
</xref>], which is one of the prime concerns of MR fluid stability. It is shown that the specially developed methods of the slurry handling, pumping, and online monitoring and maintaining the MR fluid properties provide stability to the MRP fluid. Shorey <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211426948">
<bold>15</bold>
</xref>] found that the nano-hardness of CIPs is important in MRF with non-aqueous MR fluids without using NMAPs, but it is relatively unimportant when aqueous MR fluids with NMAPs are used. MRR increases with the addition of NMAPs such as CeO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and diamond. The diamond particles are ten times more efficient than CeO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particles. Kordonski and Golini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211426948">
<bold>16</bold>
</xref>] designed a few auxiliary devices which are necessary for proper circulation of MR fluid in the MRF process. It regulates the MR fluid flowrate by feedback-assisted computer control so that the MRP fluid can be continuously circulated. A 3D silicon micro-channel structure was finished by MRF process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211426948">
<bold>17</bold>
</xref>]. The roughness of bottom and side surfaces of the silicon channel was reduced by a factor of 5–10. The pressure drop of a gas flow through this silicon micro-channel was lowered to 26.7 per cent of the pressure drop in an unfinished micro-channel. It was also found that the concentration of magnetic particles and strength of the magnetic field are important parameters for MRF process. The NMAPs move away from the magnet (towards workpiece surface) due to the magnetic levitation force. The magnetic levitation force (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>ml</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211426948">
<bold>18</bold>
</xref>] is given by
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0954406211426948"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211426948-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>where <italic>V<sub>a</sub>
</italic> is the volume of non-magnetic body (or NMAPs), <italic>M</italic> the intensity of magnetization of magnetic fluid, μ<sub>0</sub> the permeability of free space, and ∇<italic>H</italic> the gradient of magnetic field.</p>
<p>The MRF process is used for fabrication of curved surfaces on silicon-based micro-structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211426948">
<bold>19</bold>
</xref>]. The edge effect is found to be very important when the target workpiece gets smaller because of much higher magnetic field intensity at the edges. However, the undesirable edge effect can be profitably used for the fabrication of curved surface structures on millimetre scale (2–3 mm). The results could have been better if CeO<sub>2</sub> had been used as an abrasive constituent of MRP fluid in the place of MR fluid (without any NMAPs).</p>
<p>It is possible to polish soft optical polymers like PMMA, CVD polycrystalline ZnS, and water-soluble single-crystal KDP by appropriately choosing the composition of MRP fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211426948">
<bold>20</bold>
</xref>]. The systematic alteration of MR fluid chemistry (specifically, slurry pH) is required to match the unique physical properties of individual workpiece material. Jung <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211426948">
<bold>21</bold>
</xref>] focused on increasing MRR using sintered iron–carbon nano-tubes compound as abrasive in the MR fluid. It increases FR in the case of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>–TiC hard disc slider. In this finishing process, a rectilinear alternating motion of the workpiece is superimposed with the rotating motion of the permanent magnet tool. The main limitation of this process is that the rotational speed of the tool cannot be increased beyond a certain critical r/min due to the spilling out of the polishing medium from the tool which reduces MRR as well as change in surface roughness value (Δ<italic>R</italic>
<sub>a</sub>). This seems to be good for finishing external surfaces of the workpieces but not so good for the complex internal geometries.</p>
<p>Cheng <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211426948">
<bold>22</bold>
</xref>] designed a MR fluid-based two-axes wheel finishing tool which rotates about its own axis and at the same time about the co-rotating axis. The surface roughness of parabolic K9 lens of 60 mm diameter is reduced from 3.8 to 1.2 nm after 10 min, and the shape accuracy with an initial value of 2.27 to 0.36 mm rms after 60 more minutes of fine polishing. A penalized multi-response Taguchi method has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954406211426948">
<bold>23</bold>
</xref>] to show that the optimization procedure can simultaneously maximize MRR and minimize surface roughness without violating the boundary constraints. When maximizing, the MRR is given higher weightage over minimizing the surface roughness value.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0954406211426948">
<title>2.2.1 Forces in MRF</title>
<p>For any finishing process, type, magnitude, and direction of forces acting on the workpiece play a major role on the quality of the finished surface. It has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211426948">
<bold>15</bold>
</xref>] from the atomic force microscope images that NMAPs move towards the workpiece surface because of low magnetic field gradient. This movement of NMAPs towards the workpiece increases MRR. A transition from a two-body to a three-body abrasion model for material removal is also hypothesized. The difference between the normal force acting on the workpiece surface in MRF process and conventional polishing process has been discussed in Shorey <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211426948">
<bold>24</bold>
</xref>]. The normal force on the workpiece in the conventional polishing process transferred from the polishing polyurethane pad is of the order of millinewton in magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954406211426948">
<bold>25</bold>
</xref>], and it sometimes results in deep scratches on the workpiece surface. In the MRF process, NMAPs create relatively low normal load on the workpiece surface and it is estimated to be several times less than that of conventional polishing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954406211426948">
<bold>26</bold>
</xref>]. This normal force can be estimated by the sum of the magnetic buoyant force and the component of the hydrostatic force normal to the workpiece surface.</p>
<p>A two-dimensional (2D) force sensor for simultaneous measurement of both drag and normal forces in MRF process has been used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954406211426948">
<bold>27</bold>
</xref>]. The mechanism governing MRR in the MRF process for optical glasses, in terms of the hydrodynamic pressure and shear stress in the converging gap is addressed. This study demonstrates that the volumetric MRR increases with an increase in shear stress. The shear stress exhibits a positive linear dependence on a material figure of merit (FOM) that depends on Young’s modulus, fracture toughness, and hardness of the workpiece. However, the effect of process parameters, such as concentration of magnetic particles and NMAPs, wheel speed, and working gap, have not been studied with respect to shear stress in MRF process.</p>
<p>It is found by Miao <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954406211426948">
<bold>28</bold>
</xref>] that normal and tangential forces increase initially with the addition of nano-diamond particles but they stabilize at higher concentration. Significant increase in tangential and normal forces is observed by decreasing the working gap. It is also found that normal force increases with an increase in wheel speed but it has no apparent effect on tangential force. It may happen when the shear strength of the MR fluid is lower than the tangential force acting on the solid constituents (CIPs and NMAPs). As a result, the MRP fluid itself gets sheared by the solid constituents instead of holding them and building up (or increasing) the shear force acting on the workpiece.</p>
<p>Sidpara and Jain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954406211426948">
<bold>29</bold>
</xref>] investigated the effect of CIPs concentration, NMAPs concentration, carrier wheel speed, and working gap on the normal force (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>n</sub>) and tangential force (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>t</sub>). The normal and tangential forces increase with an increase in NMAPs concentration up to an optimum level beyond which they start decreasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211426948">Fig. 5</xref>). The maximum contribution to the forces acting on the workpiece surface is made by working gap followed by CIPs concentration whereas the least contribution is noticed in the case of wheel speed. It indicates that the MRF process performance is dominated by the magnetic field and magnetic particles concentration compared to other parameters.

<title>2.3 Theoretical investigations</title>
<p>The theoretical study of MRF process is vital to understand the physics of the process, to simulate the process, and to predict the responses. The flow of MR fluid through the converging gap is analogous to the classical hydrodynamic lubrication problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954406211426948">
<bold>30</bold>
</xref>]. Based on this theory, the shear stress (τ<sub>xy</sub>) in the gap is calculated and the zone of unsheared MR fluid ribbon on the workpiece as well as on the wheel surface is predicted. The shear stress is given by

</xref>] introduced a new MRR model for MRF of glass. Validation of the proposed MRR model for MRF of glass is done with the experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954406211426948">
<bold>26</bold>
</xref>]. These experiments were conducted using nano-diamond added MRP fluid and a set of six optical glasses as workpieces. The MRR increases with the increase in nano-diamond powder concentration and it gives a maxima. Glasses with phosphate network formers require less drag force to remove material compared to glasses with silicon network formers. It is observed that in MRF, MRR is best described, not only by one single term, covering glass mechanical properties, but also with a combination of terms that involve mechanics, polishing particle properties, and chemistry.</p>
<p>Theoretical models of centrifugal force acting on NMAPs and magnetic force of attraction between any two neighbouring magnetized particles are derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211426948">

However, other force components, such as the capillary viscous force due to the presence of water, squeezing force, the gravitational force, etc. are ignored.

<title>3 ABRASIVE FLOW FINISHING</title>
<p>In AFF process, polymer-based visco-elastic abrasive medium is extruded back and forth between two vertically opposite cylinders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211426948">Fig. 9</xref>). This medium finishes the workpiece surface selectively while extruding through the passage formed by the workpiece and tooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954406211426948">
<bold>37</bold>
</xref>]. Because of the flow through the restricted narrow passage in the workpiece region, the polymer chains hold abrasive particles (APs) flexibly and orient themselves in the direction of applied extrusion pressure. Thus, the medium acts as a multipoint flexible cutting tool. Extrusion pressure, number of cycles, workpiece initial surface roughness, and medium viscosity are some of the variable parameters that have an impact on the achievable final surface roughness. When appropriate extrusion pressure is applied on the visco-elastic medium, it moves along the direction of applied pressure with axial velocity (<italic>V</italic>

<p>AFF system consists of three basic elements: machine, tooling, and medium. Machine consists of hydraulic system and medium cylinders which are supported in line by supporting frame. The hydraulic system is a positive displacement system, which forces the medium through the tooling at a selected pressure and flowrate. Tooling is one of the major elements of the AFF system. Major functions of the tooling are to direct the flow of medium and to precisely control the area to be finished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954406211426948">

<p>The medium is an important element of AFF process as it is a primary flexible cutting tool of the process, and it is also called as <italic>self-deformable stone</italic>. The medium should possess three basic properties, namely, good flow ability, self-deformability, and abrading ability to finish the given surface to nano-scale. The medium should also possess enough degree of cohesion and tenacity to drag the APs along with it through various passages. The medium composition and its rheological properties are important to understand the role of medium in the mechanism of material removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954406211426948">

<title>3.1 Classification of AFF machine</title>
<p>AFF machines are classified into four types: one-way AFF, two-way AFF, orbital AFF, and micro-AFF. One-way AFF process extrudes the medium unidirectionally. During extrusion of the medium, the APs shear the peaks of the workpiece surface and reduce its Ra value. After extrusion, the medium comes out of the workpiece and it is recirculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211426948">Fig. 10(a)</xref>). This process is good for components with complex internal shapes where forward flow of the medium is easy but not the reverse. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211426948">Figure 10(b)</xref> shows a sectional view of orbital AFF of a solid, complex-shaped component having no through passage. In this case, the medium is flowing across the gap between the tool and the workpiece, and the normal force is applied by pressing the tool downward. Study related to force analysis, medium thermal properties, and their effects on the process performance has not been reported in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0954406211426948">

</fig>
</p>
<p>The orbital AFF process is normally used to finish blind and shallow cavities such as coins and dies. It is the combination of form grinding and two-way AFF process. Here, medium reciprocates in two ways and the orbital motion is given to the form tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211426948">Fig. 10(b)</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0954406211426948">

</xref>].</p>
<p>Two-way AFF process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211426948">Fig. 9</xref>) extrudes the medium along to and fro directions. It is normally used to finish cylindrical (internal and external) surfaces and complex-shaped surfaces which have through holes. The μ-AFF process is similar to the two-way except that it uses low viscosity medium and very fine APs. This helps the medium to flow through micro-size features (50–750 μm). The μ-AFF ideally suits to various manufacturing sectors such as automotive, medical, and extrusion dies. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0954406211426948">

<title>3.2 Mechanism of material removal and forces in AFF process</title>
<p>In AFF process, material removal is purely carried out by mechanical abrasion.

During the AFF process, APs penetrate the workpiece surface due to radial force (<italic>F</italic>

<p>Though the AFF process has many merits, it also has limitations, such as low FR (or low productivity), and incapable of correcting the minor form geometries. The medium’s finishing capabilities decline because the medium’s rheological properties decay during AFF process which results in lower FR. Many researchers have been working to improve FR, surface integrity, and compressive residual stresses produced on the finished workpiece surface. Some of the findings have been discussed in the following sections.</p>

The ion conductivity of electrolytes is much lower than the conductivity of electrolytes employed in ordinary electrochemical machining. It further decreases by the addition of inorganic fillers (APs). This polymeric electrolyte medium in semi-liquid paste is forced through small interelectrode gap. Experimental investigations revealed that this hybrid process offers technological and economical advantages compared to AFF alone.</p>

<title>3.3.2 Obstruction-assisted AFF</title>
<p>Spiral fluted screw is placed at the centre of the hole in the workpiece as an obstruction and is rotated using external energy source. The rotational motion of the screw lifts the medium from lower region to upper region, and tries to finish the hole while passing through it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0954406211426948">
<bold>47</bold>
</xref>]. This process might show good results for high viscous medium only if it can properly adhere to the screw. In the case of low viscosity medium, there is a possibility of slip between the medium and the screw. Some researchers have used drill bit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0954406211426948">
<bold>48</bold>
</xref>] in the place of screw to achieve almost similar objective, and called it as drill bit-guided AFF.</p>
<p>The centrifugal force-assisted AFF process uses one of the different shapes (triangular, spline, square, and rectangular) of centrifugal force generating tiny rod which is placed at the centre of the medium slug in the workpiece finishing region. The rotating rod strikes the APs that come in contact with it, and due to the centrifugal force, it moves the APs towards the workpiece. This process is claimed to increase the finishing rate by 70–80 per cent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0954406211426948">

<title>3.3.3 Rotational AFF</title>
<p>In rotational-abrasive flow finishing (R-AFF) process, the workpiece fixture is externally rotated by a variable frequency drive. Due to the workpiece rotation and medium reciprocation, the active APs interact with the workpiece in a helical path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954406211426948">Fig. 13(a)</xref>).

Its properties are independent of temperature and constant with regards to time and space. Theoretical models for micro-ploughing and micro-cutting are also proposed. In the case of aggressive (high-viscosity medium with high forces) finishing, the medium exhibits non-linear viscous flow properties and its viscosity decreases with an increase in temperature. If the non-linearity and temperature effects are considered, one can enhance the model accuracy and it would give a better agreement with the experimental results. Gorana <italic>et al</italic>.

<bold>62</bold>
</xref>] found that shear rate increases when the medium passes through the restricted passage; hence, shear stress acting on the workpiece also increases. It is also concluded that greater finishing action is achieved as a result of longer piston stroke duration, due to higher wall shear stress generated. The wall shear stress depends on extrusion pressure, passage cross-sectional area, and medium viscosity. It seems that the greater finishing action in longer piston stroke duration is achieved due to the finishing actions by both more number of APs per unit stroke and higher wall shear stress due to restricted passage.</p>

The AE<sub>RMS</sub> of the signal is sensitive to extrusion pressure and other AFF process parameters, which affect material removal.

<p>Jain and Jain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0954406211426948">
<bold>68</bold>
</xref>] presented a simple model for heat transfer in AFF considering heat flow to the workpiece and medium using one-dimensional (1D) unsteady state heat transfer theory.

<p>Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0954406211426948">

</xref>] experimentally determined thermal properties of the medium such as thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity and surface heat transfer coefficient of medium for the various mixtures of polyborosiloxane and silicon carbide abrasive. These experimental results were compared with mathematical model, which were then used to study thermal behaviour of medium as a function of its composition and temperature. Specific heat capacity of the mixture was modelled based on the mass proportion of each constituent. Surface heat transfer coefficient between interface of mixture and die was predominantly found as a function of APs concentration. Type of polymer and APs size were found to be less significant for surface heat transfer coefficient.</p>
<p>From the above discussion of AFF process, it is concluded that the viscosity of polishing medium is the main process parameter in AFF process, which is least controllable during finishing. Hence, controlling of finishing forces by any external means is difficult in AFF process. Also, the preparation of homogeneous mixture of APs and plasticizer in visco-elastic polymeric medium is cumbersome. Preparation of different viscosity medium always needs a new polymer base medium of comparable viscosity.</p>

<title>4 MRAFF AND ROTATIONAL-MRAFF</title>
<p>From the above discussion of AFF process, it is concluded that AFF is not a deterministic process because the forces acting on the workpiece cannot be controlled in-process unless medium composition and/or finishing conditions are changed online. On the other hand, in MRF process, the forces can be externally controlled but the complex shapes and very hard workpieces cannot be finished due to setup configuration and medium composition.</p>
<p>In view of the above-mentioned limitations of AFF and MRF processes, a hybrid finishing process was thought by combining these two processes, leading to the development of MRAFF process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0954406211426948">
<bold>69</bold>
</xref>]. The MRAFF process maintains the versatility of AFF process and at the same time introduces determinism and in-process controllability of the rheological properties of the polishing medium of MRF process.</p>

<title>4.1 Working principle of MRAFF and parametric analysis</title>
<p>In MRAFF process, a magnetically stiffened slug of MRP fluid is extruded back and forth through the passage formed by the workpiece and fixture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0954406211426948">
<bold>69</bold>
</xref>]. The finishing mechanism of MRAFF process is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954406211426948">Fig. 14</xref>. Magnetic field is selectively applied across the workpiece surface only where the abrasion is needed keeping other areas unaffected. Inside the polishing medium, the NMAPs are held by the CIP chains and they shear peaks from the workpiece surface.

<p>Jha and Jain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0954406211426948">
<bold>69</bold>
</xref>] concluded that magnetic flux density is the main contributor in improving surface finish among the three main variables: magnetic flux density, extrusion pressure, and finishing cycles. As the magnetic flux density increases by increasing magnetizing current to electromagnet, CIP chains hold the NMAPs more firmly and thereby result in faster finishing action. Another important finding from the analysis of experimental results at different finishing cycles is that the actual finishing takes place only after removal of all the loosely held ploughed material left out after grinding. The surface roughness value progressively decreases with further increase in finishing cycles till the critical surface finish is achieved. It depends on the NMAPs size and extrusion pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0954406211426948">
<bold>70</bold>
</xref>].</p>
<p>MRAFF is capable of super finishing hard materials such as silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) using boron carbide, silicon carbide, and diamond abrasives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0954406211426948">
<bold>71</bold>
</xref>]. Silicon carbide is found to be more effective in finishing Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> workpiece in comparison with boron carbide. Experimental study on stainless steel workpieces and theoretical modelling of finishing forces reveal that the relative size ratio of CIPs and NMAPs plays an important role in finishing performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0954406211426948">
<bold>72</bold>
</xref>]. The value of Δ<italic>R</italic>
<sub>a</sub> decreases as the size of CIPs becomes smaller because of decrease in the interparticle magnetic force between CIPs which governs the force responsible for holding NMAPs during shearing action and restraining CIPs chains from breaking. This phenomenon is further investigated by the rheological study of MRP medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0954406211426948">
<bold>73</bold>
</xref>]. It is found that shear thinning nature of the MRP fluids is due to the fast rupturing of CIP chains at high shear rates.</p>
<p>However, the disadvantages of MRAFF process include low FR (nm/cycle), particularly on hard materials. The FR for stainless steel workpiece (hardness 358 BHN) is 0.65 nm/cycle and it is 0.09 nm/cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0954406211426948">
<bold>71</bold>
</xref>] in the case of silicon-nitride as harder workpiece material (hardness 2718 BHN). The experiments were conducted at a pressure of 37.5 bar and a magnetic field of 0.6  T in both the cases. One of the possible reasons for low FR in MRAFF process is that the interaction between the NMAPs and the work surface is in straight line sweeping a small area. Second, only a small percentage of NMAPs which are on the periphery of the slug actually participate in the finishing operation. To reduce the time of finishing, there is a need for more interaction between an individual NMAP and workpiece over a longer length in a single stroke covering a larger area of workpiece. Also, in MRAFF process, magnetic field is applied to the cylindrical fixture with two core materials of an electromagnet which are placed opposite to each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0954406211426948">
<bold>69</bold>
</xref>]. Due to this, magnetic field in front of the core material is high and it becomes very low on either side of the core material. Least magnetic field is observed on the cylindrical fixture at a point which is perpendicular to the line joining these two core materials of the electromagnet. Hence, workpiece kept in this zone of low magnetic field is, comparatively, less finished than the one kept in the zone in front of the core material. Researchers are working to achieve uniform nano-level finishing on different types of complex objects with or without the application of magnetic field.</p>

<p>Sadiq and Shunmugam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0954406211426948">
<bold>76</bold>
</xref>] developed a finishing process similar to the conventional honing to polish external curved surfaces using MRP medium. The workpiece is rotated within the medium and at the same time a reciprocating motion is provided to the medium. The major disadvantage of this process is that the electromagnet core and the workpiece surface are separated by a thick wall of the polishing medium container. Due to this, there is a major reduction in the magnetic field intensity and hence low finishing forces act during the finishing process resulting in low FR. For stainless steel workpiece, the final surface roughness value achieved was in the range 1.3–1.7 μm. Also, this configuration of the setup is unable to polish internal surface of the workpiece. Finite element analysis was also performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0954406211426948">

However, in both these cases, radial stress due to the flow of polishing medium has not been considered to calculate normal indentation force on the workpiece through NMAPs.

<title>4.2 Development of R-MRAFF process</title>
<p>From the above literature survey, it is concluded that the above-mentioned processes need improvement to make them suitable for uniform and faster (or higher FR) polishing of complex geometrical shapes of the workpieces. To achieve this, the researchers have modified the existing MRAFF setup and optimized the polishing conditions as discussed in the following sections.</p>
<p>To enhance the process performance, NMAPs percentage in the medium can be increased or a method can be devised to increase NMAPs–workpiece interaction or both. To maintain the rheological properties of MR fluid, the NMAPs concentration cannot be increased beyond a limit. Also, there is a need to generate uniform magnetic field in the finishing zone to get uniform finishing around the workpiece surface. There are two ways to increase NMAPs–workpiece interaction. One way is to rotate the medium itself and the other is to rotate the workpiece. Rotation of workpiece is difficult in the existing MRAFF setup with the possible chances of leakage of the medium as its base material consists of mineral oil also. Therefore, rotation of the medium has been adapted by rotating the magnetic field and the process is named as rotational-MRAFF (R-MRAFF) process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0954406211426948">
<bold>79</bold>
</xref>].</p>
<p>In R-MRAFF process, other than the reciprocating motion, the polishing medium is rotated around the axis of the cylinder by imparting a rotational motion to the permanent magnets surrounding the workpiece fixture. By superimposing these two motions, a higher relative velocity and higher FR are achieved. It also produces a smoother mirror finished surface. To rotate the permanent magnets, a cylindrical fixture is designed having four slots at its periphery, 90<sup>o</sup> apart from each other to hold the magnets. This fixture is rotated by a motor having a control device. Flat workpieces are mounted at the internal surface of the cylindrical workpiece fixture having slots or cylindrical workpieces which can be directly mounted.</p>
<p>Under the magnetic field, the dispersed iron particles form a magnetic cluster along the magnetic lines of force and the NMAPs gather where the magnetic field is weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211426948">Fig. 15(a)</xref>). A relative motion takes place between the NMAPs and the workpiece surface when the magnetic poles rotate. As a result, the material is removed from the workpiece surface in the form of micro-/nano-chips which lead to nano-finishing of the workpiece surface. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211426948">Figure 15(b)</xref> shows the distribution (simulated by Ansoft Maxwell®) of magnetic flux density around the cylindrical fixture for non-magnetic stainless steel workpiece [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0954406211426948">

<p>In R-MRAFF process, due to the helical motion, the length traversed by an active NMAP is more as compared to the length traversed in MRAFF process for the same number of finishing cycles and it increases with the rotational speed of the magnet. Therefore, NMAPs cut more number of peaks in one cycle in R-MRAFF process compared to MRAFF. Hence, better finishing performance (higher FR and lower final <italic>R</italic>
<sub>a</sub> value) is achieved in R-MRAFF process than MRAFF under the similar experimental conditions. R-MRAFF process is capable of producing mirror-like finished surface in the nanometre range and surface roughness as low as 110 nm on flat stainless steel, 50 nm on flat brass workpiece [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0954406211426948">

<p>R-MRAFF process uses permanent magnets; hence, the magnetic field in the finishing zone cannot be varied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0954406211426948">

Online monitoring of the roughness parameters can be implemented in R-MRAFF process which will give better automation in the process.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the viscosity of MRP-fluid changes after continuous use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0954406211426948">

A study can be carried out to quantify and understand the changes in rheological properties of MRP-fluid, and to evolve the method to enhance the MRP-fluid’s useful life before its replacement. Further improvements in the finishing setup are required to make it useful for finishing magnetic material.</p>

<title>5 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK</title>
<p>The state-of-the-art review of MRF, AFF, and MRAFF nano-finishing techniques is presented in this article. Following conclusions can be drawn from the presented discussion.</p>
<p>The MRF is an effective finishing process for optical materials with a variety of shapes such as flat, spherical, aspherical, concave, and convex. It is successfully used for finishing micro as well as macro components. Surface roughness up to nanometre level is achieved without subsurface damage. Rheological characterization of MRP fluid is an important aspect to be studied for optimum selection of the constituents of MRP fluid, which controls the quality of the finished surface. Further, the stability of MRP fluid is a major concern in MRF and MRAFF processes, which needs to be investigated. It can be improved by inclusion of different types of surfactants.</p>
<p>AFM is capable of meeting the diverse finishing requirements of different industries, specially finishing of complex shapes for low <italic>R</italic>
<sub>a</sub> value and tight tolerances. Various models are available to correlate theoretical results with experimental results. However, the major disadvantage of this process is low FR. Continuous efforts are being made by different researchers to increase FR, improve surface texture, and to enhance MRR. Enhanced performance of the AFF process is achieved by rotating the workpiece itself (i.e. R-AFF process).</p>
<p>R-MRAFF process has been developed as a new deterministic nano-finishing process. It has also been concluded that this process possesses the ability to correct roundness error of hard cylindrical stainless steel tubes. This process is still under developmental stage, and it can be further improved after overcoming its existing limitations.</p>
<p>In R-MRAFF process, magnetic field in the finishing zone cannot be varied due to the use of permanent magnets to generate rotating magnetic field. The use of electromagnet for the same (by energizing different poles alternately) will give flexibility to vary magnetic field to polish the workpieces with varied hardness. The capabilities of R-MRAFF process can be extended to polish complex geometrical shapes by suitable design of fixture and electromagnet poles. Further, 3D CFD simulation of MRP fluid in the finishing zone and simulation of surface roughness will help to automate R-MRAFF process for better finishing performance.</p>
