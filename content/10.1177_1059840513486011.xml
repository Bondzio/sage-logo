<abstract>
<p>Local health departments have typically led school-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs, assuming resource-intensive roles in design, coordination, and vaccination. This level of involvement is often not financially sustainable over time. Five diverse school districts in Los Angeles County designed, implemented, refined, and institutionalized their own SLIV programs over 3 years by identifying and maximizing their existing resources. School district nurses and other staff served as project leaders, designing their own vaccination administration process, parental consent, and clinic promotional models. Two districts expanded their existing school immunization clinics and three developed their vaccination capacity with community partnerships. Each district tailored its program in creative resource-minimum ways, sometimes abandoning or adopting new methods/technologies based on the effectiveness in previous seasons. The shared experiences and strategies between district nurses and the local health department described in this article illustrate a district’s ability to develop a tailor-made SLIV program, often in less than ideal conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Healthy children are more likely to be engaged students prepared for academic success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840513486011">Magalnick &amp; Mazyck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840513486011">National Association of School Nurses, 2011a</xref>). As health care experts, school nurses play a vital role in reducing health-related barriers to learning and promoting a healthy school environment. Since 1902, school nurses have been actively involved with public health functions such as disease surveillance, compliance with immunization requirements, and educating families about communicable diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840513486011">National Association of School Nurses, 2011b</xref>). School nurses remain at the forefront of addressing health solutions in an educational setting, and the <italic>Healthy People 2020</italic>initiative encourages school districts to employ at least one nurse per 750 students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840513486011">U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, 2012</xref>). As advocates, school nurses practice in an ideal setting to educate the community and to collaborate with local health departments to influence action related to mandated and recommended immunizations including influenza, especially in areas with large numbers of underimmunized children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840513486011">National Association of School Nurses, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>National public health efforts to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to influenza led to the focus on vaccinating children who are known to have the highest influenza infection and transmission rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840513486011">Glezen, 1996</xref>). The attack rate among children ranges from 10% to 40%, and approximately 1% of these infections results in hospitalization annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840513486011">American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840513486011">Glezen, Decker, &amp; Perrotta, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840513486011">Heikkinen, Thint, &amp; Chonmaitree, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840513486011">Neuzil et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840513486011">Neuzil, Wright, Mitchel, &amp; Griffin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840513486011">Pickering, Long, &amp; McMillan, 2006</xref>). The vaccination of school-aged children has been shown to reduce the impact of influenza on the communities where they reside, which is especially important for at risk populations such as those 65 years of age and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840513486011">Ghendon, Kaira, &amp; Elshina, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840513486011">Glezen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840513486011">Hurwitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840513486011">Loeb et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840513486011">Monto, Davenport, Napier, &amp; Francis, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059840513486011">Piedra, Gaglani, Kozinetz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840513486011">Piedra, Gaglani, Riggs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840513486011">Reichert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059840513486011">Talbot et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) expanded their annual influenza immunization recommendations in 2008 to include all children from 6 months through 18 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840513486011">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in school-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs has been shown to be an effective mechanism to reach children and significantly reduce absenteeism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840513486011">Davis, King, Moag, Cummings, &amp; Magder, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840513486011">King et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840513486011">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840513486011">Mears, Lawler, Sanders, &amp; Katz, 2009</xref>). In 2007, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Immunization Program (LACDPH-IP) recruited five school districts to pilot an LAIV vaccination program, under the leadership of school nurses, utilizing the schools’ resources and partnerships. With the anticipated release of the 2008 expanded influenza recommendations, the timing of such a pilot program was opportune as 2007 was also the first year of licensure of a refrigerator-stable LAIV.</p>
<p>Systematic reviews of SLIV programs have documented best practices to minimize obstacles and maximize participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840513486011">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840513486011">Hull &amp; Ambrose, 2011</xref>). Less is known about how SLIV programs can evolve from within existing school-based infrastructure under the leadership of school nurses, with guidance from local health departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840513486011">Ransom, 2009</xref>). A process-oriented approach to SLIV program development, which takes readiness into account is necessary as school districts vary in size, capacity, and access to school nurses. In addition, reduced local health department budgets limit their capacity to provide staff and other resources.</p>
<p>This article presents five school district SLIV implementation models employed during three influenza seasons, along with lessons learned and recommendations for other school districts to consider when planning programs within the confines of existing resources. Given the current national and local shortfalls in funding for public health and school health services, this information is essential to the wider school community, particularly if school districts will continue to be expected to offer important vaccinations at the school sites.</p>

<title>Background and Study Design</title>
<p>A case study methodological approach is presented to provide background on the collaborative planning efforts between a local health department and school district nurses, providing a context to SLIV efforts in a diverse, metropolitan area. This approach allows for a rich integration of data from a variety of sources, such as local surveys, immunization registry data, and interviews with immunization stakeholders. The observed time line reflects the following influenza seasons: Pilot Season (2007–2008); Season 2 (H1N1 influenza season, 2009–2010); and Season 3 (2010–2011). The missing season (2008–2009) was omitted due to insufficient data pertaining to all partners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1059840513486011">
<title>Description of the Pilot Season</title>
<p>During the 2007–2008 school year, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Immunization Program implemented a pilot, school-based LAIV vaccination program. In the late spring/early summer of 2007, Public Health Nurse (PHN) community liaisons that routinely interact with school districts identified potential school districts with the capacity to vaccinate school children without the support of external vaccinators, and these districts were subsequently invited to participate. All identified districts expressed interest and therefore voluntarily participated in the Pilot Season.</p>
<p>Each participating school district received a multipurpose pilot campaign packet that was created by the LACDPH-IP to assist schools with the promotion of the campaign and to educate parents/guardians about influenza and the value of vaccination. Vaccine Information Statements along with materials developed by LACDPH-IP, including fact sheets on influenza vaccination, consent forms, and a confidential questionnaire, were distributed to parents/guardians by the school districts. In addition, a modifiable principal and parent letter along with influenza vaccine accountability forms were designed for school district staff. School district staff, including nurses, clerical, and school administrators, also received in-depth training by LACDPH-IP staff on ACIP recommendations, administration, and handling of vaccines and the use of accountability forms.</p>
<p>Participating school districts received vaccine from the LACDPH-IP which is purchased annually by the California Department of Public Health and distributed to local health departments. The number of doses allocated to each participating school district was determined by a self-assessment of capacity, without input from LACDPH-IP. Some districts obtained additional vaccine through their enrollment in the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program.</p>
<p>The schools already have standard operating procedures in place for informing parents/guardians about childhood vaccinations and obtaining their consent. The multipurpose influenza campaign packet provided further information that was incorporated into these existing procedures. After consent was obtained from the parents/guardians, school nurses administered LAIV (2007–2008 formulation of the FluMist<sup>®</sup> vaccine) intranasally to students. Vaccine accountability forms, consent forms, and the confidential parent questionnaires were collected by the school nurses. School districts varied in their approach to promoting, consenting, and vaccinating students. When possible, children younger than 9 years who had never received an influenza vaccination were offered a second dose 6–10 weeks after the first dose.</p>
<p>At the end of the Pilot Season, school districts were asked to complete a postimplementation questionnaire, developed by LACDPH-IP, regarding their experience implementing the campaign. Under the leadership of district nurses, a school nurse and/or staff member provided information on school student enrollment, child acceptance of LAIV, implementation challenges and strategies, and other related issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840513486011">
<title>Description of Seasons 2 and 3</title>
<p>The school districts built upon their experiences in the Pilot Season and operated more independently in subsequent seasons. During Seasons 2 and 3, the role of LACDPH-IP was to ensure participating school districts had adequate vaccine and to update educational materials and vaccine accountability procedures. LACDPH-IP also helped school districts overcome barriers related to vaccine availability. A “school tool kit,” an updated version of the pilot campaign packet, was developed by LACDPH-IP and shared with participating school districts and was also made available on the Internet. All campaign materials were available in both English and Spanish languages and translated by LACDPH-IP to meet the needs of school districts that served the Asian/Pacific Islander communities. LACDPH-IP staff was also available to school district nurses for consultation on addressing clinical issues related to vaccine administration and resolving technical issues related to accountability.</p>
<p>LACDPH-IP enhanced the postimplementation questionnaire used in the pilot study with additional questions aimed at gaining insight on SLIV efforts over the course of three seasons. Phone interviews were conducted using the revised questionnaire with the lead school district nurse or staff member.</p>
<p>School district vaccine allocation data are routinely maintained by LACDPH-IP. The majority of vaccine administration data is maintained in the California Immunization Registry, a voluntary, state-based immunization registry in which by Season 3, most of the districts had become active participants. In previous seasons, these data were collected from influenza vaccine accountability forms that captured doses administered by age group in aggregate format.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059840513486011">
<title>Analysis of the Case Study</title>
<p>Qualitative data collected from the postimplementation questionnaires administered during the Pilot Season and Seasons 2 and 3 were transcribed, reviewed, and coded. Based on emergent themes, the research staff organized the information into three basic categories defined as vaccine administration, vaccination consent, and vaccination clinic promotion. These categories reflect central strategies or models necessary to promote the vaccination event to students and families, to secure parental consent, and to administer influenza vaccine in a school setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059840513486011">
<title>Organization of the Case Study</title>
<p>Each school district described in this article has been de-identified through the use of a label, School District A, B, C, D, and E. Use of the case study approach provides an opportunity to discuss qualitative indicators such as adaptability and growth that may be evident or perhaps pertinent to successful school nurse-led SLIV activities. The research team draws upon the results of the case studies to summarize lessons learned, explore potential areas of growth, and share recommendations with other school nurses who are motivated to start and/or continue with school-led influenza campaigns. These case studies were shared with and reviewed by the participating school district nursing staff to ensure an accurate and comprehensive profile of their experience. The information analyzed and shared in this article was reviewed by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Institutional Review Board.</p>

<sec id="section9a-1059840513486011">
<title>District A</title>
<p>During the Fall of 2007, District A school nurses participated in a pilot LAIV vaccination program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059840513486011">Figure 1</xref>). This district’s nurses traveled to multiple schools (elementary, middle, and high school) to hold mass vaccination clinics. They also vaccinated students at their two existing immunization clinics housed at an elementary school and a middle school. During the Pilot Season, District A based its vaccine dose request on the desire to serve as many students as possible at the SLIV locations. Knowing that efforts such as school influenza clinics help keep students healthy and in the classroom, District A expanded their SLIV program in subsequent seasons to include evening mass vaccination clinics along with their regular immunization clinics. All medically eligible students in District A were invited to be vaccinated at these clinics if parents/guardians arranged transportation. Vaccine dose requests during Seasons 2 and 3 were based on the number of students vaccinated in the Pilot Season.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1059840513486011-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Although District A maintained the same vaccination administration model, every season afforded a new lesson in conducting efficient vaccination consent and promotion models. Due to the less than optimal return rate of parental consent forms prior to the clinic during the Pilot Season, parents/guardians in Seasons 2 and 3 completed consent forms at the clinic site. Multiple methods were utilized in the seasons following the Pilot Season to promote the clinics, including automated telephone messages, yet the nurses considered flyers and word of mouth the most effective methods for reaching families.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9b-1059840513486011">
<title>District B</title>
<p>During the Fall of 2007, District B school nurses implemented a pilot LAIV vaccination program comprising three nurses traveling to all district schools during school hours to administer vaccines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059840513486011">Figure 2</xref>). A long-standing relationship with a community free clinic allows for the presence of a medical office at the combined middle/high school; thus, Pilot Season influenza clinics were also held at this location. School district nurses were motivated to continue the SLIV program into subsequent seasons due to reduced student absenteeism and the positive impact on the community at large. District B based its annual influenza vaccine requests on each school’s estimate of children needing vaccination, with doses allocated to schools based on the number vaccinated in the previous season.</p>
<fig id="fig2-1059840513486011" position="float">
<label>Figure 2.</label>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1059840513486011-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>District B maintained its existing SLIV administration model through subsequent seasons and tailored their consent and promotion models to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of vaccine administration. A variety of methods were employed by the district in promoting clinics, with large banners and automated telephone calls considered the most effective by the district in reaching families. Making consent forms available on the district’s website also improved efficiency. The district school nurses appreciated the additional support that can be gained by collaboration with local partners such as community free clinics. Therefore, in Seasons 2 and 3, the valuable assistance of students and the parent–teacher association (PTA) were integrated in the development of promotional materials and paperwork distribution at the clinics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9c-1059840513486011">
<title>District C</title>
<p>During the Fall of 2007, District C school nurses implemented a pilot LAIV vaccination program consisting of three nurses traveling to a central school district office, two school-based clinics, and an additional elementary and middle school to vaccinate students before, during, and after school, depending on nurse schedules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1059840513486011">Figure 3</xref>). Schools were selected for participation based upon the willingness of school administration and the availability of staff at the school to host a clinic. Vaccine was also available to all students at the school district office by appointment. Motivated by the desire to have more healthy students and reduced student absenteeism, the SLIV program was expanded in subsequent seasons to include more schools. During the Pilot Season, district nurses requested the amount of vaccine they felt was realistic to administer given their resources. In subsequent seasons, they based their request upon the previous season’s usage and the school’s enrollment, with a goal to vaccinate as many students as possible.</p>
<fig id="fig3-1059840513486011" position="float">

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1059840513486011-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Since schools opted to participate in the SLIV program each season, each school’s nurse played a key role in tailoring vaccination consent and promotion models. The use of school marquees and automated telephone messages were acknowledged by the nurses as the most effective methods to promote the clinics. To expand the reach to parents/guardians, consent forms were made available at the clinic in Seasons 2 and 3 as well as at participating school offices. Although the district only utilized employed staff to conduct the SLIV programs, they did see a benefit in utilizing additional support staff for crowd control and other clinic administrative needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9d-1059840513486011">
<title>District D</title>
<p>During the Fall of 2007, District D school nurses implemented a pilot LAIV vaccination program in partnership with a nonprofit, hospital-based agency that provided scheduled mobile van clinics during and after school hours, enhanced by logistical support from the school district nurses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1059840513486011">Figure 4</xref>). Two school nurses assisted in the vaccination efforts of the mobile van staff. The agency offers routine childhood vaccinations at various community sites, including select District D schools. The school district nurses endorse the public health goal of prevention; hence, their motivation to continue vaccination efforts in subsequent seasons was the desire to keep more children in school, so they do not fall behind in educational achievement due to absences. District D based its annual vaccine requests on the student enrollment at large participating schools as well as those that achieved a high vaccination rate in Season 2. Vaccine was allocated to the selected schools based on the number of consent forms returned by parents/guardians prior to the clinic.</p>
<fig id="fig4-1059840513486011" position="float">
<label>Figure 4.</label>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1059840513486011-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In subsequent seasons, school closures within the district required that the vaccination administration model be implemented at different schools, while slightly fine-tuning its consent and promotion methods. The district established clinics that started in the morning and others that took place at the end of the school day so additional parents/guardians who arrived to pick up their child could be made aware of the clinic and consent to have their child vaccinated at that time. While special notices were considered by the district staff to be the most effective way to reach families in the Pilot Season, automated telephone messages were considered more effective in the subsequent seasons.</p>

<p>During the Fall of 2007, District E school nurses implemented a pilot LAIV vaccination program that consisted of three to four nurses traveling to all district elementary and middle schools to administer vaccines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1059840513486011">Figure 5</xref>). This district’s school nurses decided to continue and expand their school influenza vaccination program during the subsequent influenza seasons due to the success of the Pilot Season and with the additional benefit of revenue received by the district through California’s Average Daily Attendance that funds districts using student attendance. The program expansion included the addition of the two district high schools. District E requested vaccine annually based upon the total number of students vaccinated in the previous season. The number of submitted consent forms determined the number of doses taken to each school clinic, with the goal of vaccinating as many students as possible.</p>

<p>Valuable lessons were identified from the continued fine-tuning of the district’s vaccination administration, consent, and promotion models over the seasons. The use of after-school SLIV clinics in Season 2 was not as successful as clinics held during the school day and were discontinued. The termination of mailed consent forms to high school parents/guardians, to reduce postage costs, was believed to be the cause for fewer high school students vaccinated in Season 3. District E also expanded their SLIV program support system in the seasons following the Pilot Season through collaboration with students, the PTA, and a local health care provider.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>All the districts were motivated to vaccinate as much of their student population as possible; however, individual resources along with the return rate of parental consent forms dictated the number of vaccine doses administered each season. The number of doses requested, allocated, and administered provides a contextual element to each district’s baseline capacity during the Pilot Season and evolution over time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840513486011">Table 1</xref>). Because of the interdistrict differences, these data should not be used to compare success across districts. With the caveat that Season 2 was atypical due to the pressure placed on school districts to vaccinate an unusually large number of students against H1N1, three of the districts increased the number of doses allocated and administered across three seasons. The remaining two faced various unique issues that allowed them to sustain, but not expand, their SLIV programs.</p>

<title>Vaccination Administration Model</title>
<p>Most published SLIV programs have emphasized a health department–led single mass vaccination administration model for all schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840513486011">Hull &amp; Ambrose, 2011</xref>). However, all of the districts presented in this article used existing resources to build vaccination capacity for their own SLIV programs, which could then be sustained or expanded through multiple seasons. School district nurses who were usually assigned to individual schools collaborated to travel to school sites where vaccination was occurring, with slight variations, to administer vaccine in a clinic setting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840513486011">Table 2</xref>). Districts capitalized on available resources by either maximizing their existing routine immunization clinics or expanding their vaccination capacity by collaborating with a community clinic, nonprofit hospital foundation or private neighborhood medical providers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059840513486011">Table 3</xref>). All districts utilized their own district personnel and two districts integrated parent/guardian and/or student volunteers.</p>

<title>Vaccination Consent Model</title>
<p>The parental consenting process has consistently been cited as a logistical challenge for schools in the implementation of SLIV programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840513486011">Cawley, Hull, &amp; Rousculp, 2010</xref>). However, the optimal strategy varies according to each school’s resources, access to technology, and the needs of the specific parent community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840513486011">Allison et al., 2010</xref>). As detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840513486011">Table 2</xref>, the districts utilized a variety of strategies over two seasons to identify the most efficient and effective method of obtaining consent forms. In addition to mailing or sending home forms with students, the districts made forms available at the vaccination clinics, on the district website, or at the main office. Community partners, such as community free clinics and nonprofit agencies, also assisted in these efforts so that by Season 2, refinements proved to be successful and were duplicated in Season 3, with little to no changes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1059840513486011">
<title>Vaccination Clinic Promotional Model</title>
<p>Vaccination clinic promotion often calls for a district-selected strategy to saturate families with a sufficient amount of information in advance to maximize the number of students who participate in SLIV programs. Unlike the vaccination consent and administration models, the models utilized to promote the vaccination clinics with families required a significant refinement across seasons due to the challenges of making parents/guardians aware of the clinics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840513486011">Table 2</xref>). In the Pilot Season, multiple methods were employed by the districts in an effort to test which one achieved the greatest student turnout at clinics without incurring additional expenses. All of the districts sent notices home with students and posted flyers at the schools. School districts also used existing communication mechanisms, such as parent newsletters, e-mail, announcements on the school marquee, and reminders on the schools websites to promote the vaccination clinics. In Seasons 2 and 3, use of new technologies led to significant changes in the promotional methods utilized as compared to the Pilot Season. All the districts utilized different versions of an automated telephone messaging system that most of the school nurses self-reported was very successful in reaching families. The use of automated telephone messages to deliver immunization reminders to parents/guardians of young children in clinical settings has been shown to increase uptake, be helpful to families, and be cost effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840513486011">Lieu, Capra, Makol, Black, &amp; Shinefield, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The collective growth of these SLIV programs is best summarized through the description of a process-oriented approach that encouraged school nurses to sustain these programs. This approach provides insight into the relevance of existing capacity/resources and the flexibility and determination of school nurses to implement a small but important system-level change. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1059840513486011">Figure 6</xref>, the process is illustrated and highlights a collaborative start-up phase initiated by the local health department. During Season 2, the subsequent expansion of these programs was led by school nurses, independent of local health department assistance. The tenacity of participating school nurses to overcome challenges fostered expansion and refinement of their activities to keep these programs active. By Season 3, the obstacles were minimal and strategies to reach students/parents stabilized, leading to the institutionalization of these SLIV programs within the participating districts.</p>

</fig>
<p>Two such challenges impacted a few of the districts: delays in receiving vaccine and the burden of photocopying vaccination materials. The first could not be solved locally, but districts were able to adjust to uncertain vaccine supplies, by maximizing flexibility when scheduling clinics and ensuring frequent communication with the local health department and/or the VFC program. The second, seemingly small obstacle of reproducing vaccination materials, resulted from limited equipment, materials, and availability of staff, notably in linguistically diverse districts. Still, school nurses navigated these trials and resolved to find a way, given their conviction of the importance of influenza vaccination.</p>
<sec id="section16-1059840513486011">
<title>Lessons Learned</title>
<p>Although the prevailing evidence on SLIV programs suggests the need for an equal partnership with local health departments and school districts in order to yield successful programs, the experiences shared in this article highlight a stronger leadership role by school districts. School districts, with nurses and other staff as project leaders, can implement and sustain influenza vaccination programs even in instances when the role of the local health department is limited to providing technical guidance, template materials, and vaccine.</p>
<p>The absence of long-term funding is often cited as the major impediment to sustainable SLIV programs. However, efforts to facilitate collaboration between school nurses and outside providers within a school district catchment area, along with other innovative strategies utilized by the five participating school districts, can be beneficial to the implementation and growth of SLIV programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059840513486011">Vogt &amp; Wortley, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Guidance for School Nursing Practice</title>
<p>A school district contemplating an influenza vaccination program, regardless of the size and varied student population or other resource inequities, should first assess the entirety of resources already in place. These existing resources and/or partnerships are often overlooked or considered minimal but may suffice to start a vaccination program. The following recommendations, based on the district experiences shared in this article, can be utilized by other districts beginning SLIV programs as well as by those with existing programs who may want to increase the efficiency of processes and decrease the costs:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>A school district should examine the total district nursing staff available, the number of school-based clinics already in place at one or more of its schools, and the interest of active student/parent volunteer organizations for assistance.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>When struggling with challenges of school district nurse or other staff and resource shortages critical to implementing vaccination activities, including clinic advertising and photocopying of materials, a district should consider existing relationships and partnerships with community organizations sharing similar goals. Strong community partnerships often exist for schools, and, when necessary, schools can cultivate or establish new relationships with other school districts, neighborhood clinics, nonprofit foundations, local medical societies, large child care centers, and community-based organizations (Ransom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840513486011">2009</xref>). Neighborhood private or nonprofit medical providers may want to reduce the burden of immunizing all their patients by partnering or supporting local SLIV programs (Li, Freedman, &amp; Boyer-Chu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840513486011">2009</xref>). It has been documented that school nurses in other jurisdictions have been successful in developing easily reproducible and efficient SLIV programs by collaborating with the local medical community and VFC programs (Borja, Amidon, Spellings, Franzetti, &amp; Nasuta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840513486011">2009</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A school district should not feel pressured to develop a large-scale SLIV program in which large numbers of children are vaccinated or wait for an ideal set of circumstances to initiate their own program. Furthermore, the implementation of an SLIV program should not solely be based upon school enrollment or student eligibility numbers and may often be influenced by factors that vary annually and are not in the control of the school districts such as parental consent return rates, media attention, and limited resources. An SLIV program of even limited capacity in conjunction with independent vaccination efforts by other health care providers can help protect the general community from influenza (Piedra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840513486011">2007</xref>; Piedra, Gaglani, Kozinetz et al., 2005). The acceptance and institutionalization of a program across seasons is a more valued, beneficial, and realistic outcome based on deliberate, sustained efforts (Hull &amp; Ambrose, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840513486011">2011</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A district should decide the implementation model/models that works best for its own unique situation and make simple modifications as needed based upon their experiences in each season. With the technical guidance of the local health department, a “start-up school influenza clinic” template packet could be developed or a self-contained vaccine accountability and documentation system can be incorporated into an implementation model. For example, use of an immunization registry would account for administered vaccination doses as well as maintain students’ immunization records.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The authors acknowledge that the diverse implementation models and experiences of the five metropolitan school districts presented in this article may not be generalizable to every school district. However, the central premise is that a specific recipe or ideal strategy to implement a SLIV clinic is not needed; however, a driving motivation to conduct these programs is critical. The authors contend that health departments, especially those within large counties, could encourage SLIV programs by facilitating school district innovation and early planning with the optimal use of district resources. To build district commitment to these programs, local health departments can share materials regarding the burden of influenza on students, parents/guardians, and schools along with the demonstrated benefits of organizing influenza vaccination clinics. Furthermore, health departments, to the extent possible, could pursue strategies to facilitate vaccinating as many students as possible by providing influenza vaccine to school districts earlier in the school year.</p>
<p>The demanding daily activities of school nurses and districts can preclude them from integrating additional tasks by developing and institutionalizing SLIV programs. However, the amount of resources required to implement SLIV programs may be less burdensome to school nurses than the challenges and efforts they undertake annually in controlling influenza disease incidence among students, teachers, and other school staff. In addition, school district budgets are hampered annually with the financial toll of influenza-related student absentee rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840513486011">Borja et al., 2009</xref>). The district experiences shared in this article show that school nurses and other staff may need the insight from multiple seasons of clinic implementation to determine which strategies work best for their districts; however, sustainable and successful SLIV programs are feasible. Ownership, growth, and success of these programs should deservedly be attributed to school nurses, the health care professionals who play a critical role in protecting the general health of their communities as they keep children healthy in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840513486011">Baker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840513486011">Lott &amp; Johnson, 2012</xref>).</p>
