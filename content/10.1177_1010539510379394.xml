<abstract>
<p>This study examined physical activity in leisure time and at work as estimated by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and the associations between both total and domain-specific physical activity with cardiovascular risk factors in a population-based Vietnamese sample. Participants (n = 1978) were 25- to 64-year-old adults selected by stratified multistage sampling. Leisure activity contributed to &lt;5% of total moderate and vigorous activity and was not associated with cardiovascular risk factors. Total moderate and vigorous activity was associated with body composition (<italic>r</italic> = −0.16 to −0.22; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), blood glucose (<italic>r</italic> = −0.07; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), and total cholesterol (<italic>r</italic> = −0.17; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) for men and with total cholesterol (<italic>r</italic> = −0.07; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) for women after adjusting for age. Further adjustment for smoking and alcohol intake made negligible changes. These associations were largely driven by work activity, which accounted for 80% of total activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With rapid economic development over the last few decades, many developing countries in Asia have experienced a dramatic transition in disease patterns, with the burden of noncommunicable diseases outweighing traditional communicable diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510379394">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510379394">3</xref></sup> The increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases may be a result of lifestyle changes that accompany economic development, including more sedentary forms of work and leisure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510379394">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510379394">5</xref></sup> However, although there is some information on physical activity participation at community levels in these populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510379394">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510379394">11</xref></sup> little is known about whether the relationship between physical activity and chronic diseases in these populations is similar to that observed in developed countries, where the distribution of confounders and effect modifiers of this association may be quite different. Furthermore, the distinctive types of leisure and work activity performed by people in developing countries may have different health benefits. A better understanding of these issues would assist public health agencies in these countries in formulating policies related to physical activity promotion and chronic disease prevention.</p>
<p>Previous studies in developed populations have shown that physical activity is an important determinant of cardiovascular disease (CVD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510379394">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510379394">15</xref></sup> In less industrialized countries of Asia, however, this association has been less clearly documented. For example, in an urban Chinese population, commuting and leisure activity was found to be favorably associated with CVD risk factors but that more than 60 minutes of such activity was associated with high blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510379394">16</xref></sup> Similarly, men who were physically inactive at recreation were less likely to be overweight or obese in a study of residents of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510379394">17</xref></sup> Also, leisure activity was positively related with antioxidant capacity and insulin sensitivity, but heavy occupational physical activity was found to be associated with an unfavorable lipid profile in a sample of female workers in Guangdong.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510379394">18</xref></sup> This is in contrast to findings from another Chinese population-based study that low levels of work-related physical activity were a predictor of hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510379394">19</xref></sup> Likewise, physical inactivity was associated with components of metabolic syndrome and with coronary artery disease in a study of an urban population of India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510379394">9</xref></sup> <italic>While the reasons for these conflicting results remain obscure, further investigation is clearly needed to better understand the relationship between different types of physical activities and CVD in developing Asian populations</italic>.</p>
<p>In this study, we examined participation in leisure and work physical activity and their relative contributions to total moderate and vigorous activity in a population-based Vietnamese sample. The primary objective was to investigate the associations between physical activity and CVD risk factors and the extent to which these associations varied according to activity type.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1010539510379394">
<title>Samples</title>
<p>This study utilized data from a population-based survey of risk factors for CVD in Can Tho, a province in the Mekong Delta, southern Vietnam. The survey was conducted using the World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise approach to non-communicable disease (STEPS). The sample was selected by multistage sampling of 25- to 64-year-old Can Tho residents and was stratified by age, sex, and urban/rural location. The response rate was 73.7% (1978/2683). All participants provided informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy. Data collection was carried out from July to November 2005. Details of this survey have been reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510379394">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510379394">21</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1010539510379394">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>The STEPS survey included measures of behavioral risk factors (tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity), physical characteristics (weight and height, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure), and blood chemistry (fasting blood glucose [BG] and total cholesterol [TC]).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510379394">22</xref></sup> The survey questionnaire was translated and backtranslated by independent translators and was administered face-to-face by trained interviewers. All measurements were performed according to the WHO STEPS protocols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510379394">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Physical activity was measured by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), a component of the STEPS questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510379394">22</xref></sup> GPAQ gathers information on the frequency and duration of moderate and vigorous physical activity in a typical week. Physical activities of at least 10 minutes duration were reported for each domain (work, transport, and leisure). Work physical activity was defined as “things you have to do such as paid or unpaid work, household chores, harvesting food, fishing or hunting for food, or seeking employment.” Transport physical activity included self-powered commuting activities such as walking and bicycling. Leisure activity was “activity you do for recreation, fitness, or sports.” Moderate intensity activity was defined as activity that “makes you breathe somewhat harder than normal.” Vigorous intensity activity was defined as activity that “makes you breathe a lot harder than normal.” Local examples of relevant activities were used to assist participants. Participants also reported time spent in sedentary behaviors (including sitting at a desk, visiting friends, reading, and watching television) during the past week. The reliability and validity of GPAQ in the Vietnamese population has been reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510379394">23</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1010539510379394">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>Physical activity data were coded and scored according to WHO guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510379394">22</xref></sup> Metabolic equivalent task (MET)-weighted hours of activity were calculated by multiplying hours of activity with the MET values provided in the guidelines (moderate activity was assigned a MET value of 4 and vigorous activity a MET value of 8). Physical activity data were right skewed and are thus presented as medians with 25th and 75th percentiles. Partial Spearman correlation coefficients were used to examine the associations of physical activity with body composition, systolic blood pressure (SBP), BG, and TC. Associations between physical activity and CVD risk factors were adjusted for age, smoking, and alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Because both physical activity level and cardiovascular risk are known to change with age, we looked for effect modification by age and found that it modified the association between sitting time and body composition in women. Therefore, this association is presented across age strata (&lt;45 years, ≥45 years). In addition, GPAQ uses a typical week as a reference period and has been shown to have different reliability and validity among study participants with stable and unstable work patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510379394">23</xref></sup> Therefore, we also stratified participants by their work patterns.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510379394">Table 1</xref> presents the average time spent in different intensities and domains of physical activity for men and women. Moderate intensity activity was the main contributor to total activity, especially among women. There were 77% of men and 93% of women who reported no vigorous activity. For both sexes, work physical activity accounted for about 80% of total moderate and vigorous intensity activity, whereas leisure activity accounted for only 2.7% of the total for men and 1.3% for women. The majority of men (92%) and women (95%) reported no leisure activity at all. Participants who reported more work activity had somewhat less leisure activity. The correlations between work and leisure activity were <italic>r</italic> = −0.04 for men and <italic>r</italic> = −0.02 for women. Despite reporting more time in moderate and vigorous activities, men in this sample spent slightly more time sitting than their female counterparts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study presents information on physical activity participation levels and their associations with CVD risk factors in a population-based Vietnamese sample, and this is the first report of physical activity in the population of the Mekong Delta. We found that leisure activity constituted less than 5% of total moderate and vigorous activity in this population and was not associated with CVD risk factor levels. Work activity, in contrast, constituted 80% of total activity and was associated with body composition, BG, and TC for men and with TC for women. Our findings provide some confirmation that consistent evidence of an inverse association between physical activity and CVD risk in Western populations could be extrapolated to Asian populations irrespective of different activity patterns.</p>
<p>Significant protective associations were observed between work physical activity and CVD risk factors, particularly among men. Although these results contrast with reports from some neighboring populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510379394">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510379394">19</xref></sup> they are biologically plausible and underline the potential importance of work-related sources of physical activity in preventing CVD in this population.</p>
<p>Leisure activity was not associated with improved CVD risk factor profiles in this study, even after adjusting for a number of potential confounding factors. This is in contrast with findings by previous studies in developed populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510379394">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510379394">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539510379394">24</xref></sup> that leisure activity is associated with reduced CVD risk. A previous study in the HCMC population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510379394">17</xref></sup> shows that men who were inactive during their leisure time were less likely to be obese, but this study did not take into account the effect of work activity, which was the major contributor to total activity in that sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510379394">10</xref></sup> In this study, as in the HCMC sample, leisure time activity formed only a small part of total activity. Furthermore, the participants of this sample who reported more leisure activity had less work activity. The higher BMI and waist circumference among men who reported some leisure activity relative to those who reported no leisure activity were also consistent with this. However, adjusting for work activity in addition to other covariates did not change the results. A more likely reason is that the leisure activity reported in this sample may have been too low in intensity or too fragmented (less than 10 minutes in duration) to be captured by GPAQ.</p>
<p>Stronger associations between physical activity and CVD risk factors were observed for men than for women in this study. This concurs with our previous findings that GPAQ assesses physical activity with less accuracy for women than for men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510379394">23</xref></sup> Similarly, a study conducted in Japanese women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539510379394">25</xref></sup> using the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510379394">14</xref></sup> also reported a weak association between physical activity and BMI. Although most studies in Western populations have shown more clearly that physical activity is inversely associated with body composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510379394">26</xref></sup> and all-cause mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539510379394">27</xref></sup> in both men and women, physical activity measured by questionnaires was not associated with CVD morbidity and mortality in women in a report from Framingham.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510379394">28</xref></sup> The generally weaker associations for women compared with those for men suggest that traditional physical activity questionnaires may not be able to comprehensively capture physical activity of women possibly because it is too fragmented and/or low in intensity.</p>
<p>In agreement with our previous report that GPAQ is more reliable and valid for participants with stable work patterns than for those with unstable work patterns,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510379394">23</xref></sup> this study observed that the correlations between physical activity and body composition were higher for those with stable work patterns than for those with more variable work activities, particularly among men. The associations of physical activity and CVD risk indicators, though modest, were also somewhat stronger for those with stable work patterns. This consistency highlights the need of a modification of GPAQ, as suggested in the previous report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510379394">23</xref></sup> to improve its measurement property in those with variable activity.</p>
<p>In this sample, the associations between sitting time and body composition was stronger for women aged 45 years or more than for their younger counterparts and persisted after adjustment for physical activity. This suggests that sedentary behavior associates with increased CVD risk through a pathway other than by compromising the time available for physical activity. Moreover, this mechanism appears to be stronger for older women.</p>
<p>The mean total activity levels (in MET hours per week) reported by participants in this study (men, 99.9; women, 70.5) are higher than those reported for a Malaysian national sample (men, 69.1; women, 69.6).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510379394">6</xref></sup> On the other hand, the total hours per week of activity (men, 20.0; women, 16.4) reported in this study are similar to those of a population sample of American Samoans (men, 25.7; women, 12.6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539510379394">29</xref></sup> and are much lower than those reported for a Bangladesh national sample (men and women combined = 46.8)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539510379394">30</xref></sup> and for a Myanmar population sample from Yangon (rural: men, 76.9 and women, 58.3; urban: men, 53.8 and women, 46.7).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510379394">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539510379394">31</xref></sup> All these surveys used the GPAQ from the WHO STEPS instrument, and the differences are unlikely to be because of measurement issues. The Malaysian population is at a more advanced stage of modernization, whereas many Vietnamese occupations still depend on physical labor. In contrast, Bangladesh and Myanmar are at relatively lower ranges of development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539510379394">32</xref></sup> and people may depend more on manual work and thus may be more physically active.</p>
<p>This study broadly describes the pattern of physical activity participation in the rural population of Vietnam. At this early stage of industrialization, a significant proportion of total activity engaged in by the Vietnamese adults in this sample was performed as part of their work in and outside of the home, much of which still consists of manual labor. Leisure activity participation, on the other hand, was minimal. Overall, regardless of activity type, participants reported a reasonable level of physical activity. However, it may be anticipated that further modernization and urbanization will lead to reduced levels of work-related activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539510379394">33</xref></sup> As this occurs, an important challenge will be to replace work activity with other forms of physical activity. To avoid the substantial declines in total physical activity that have been associated with urbanization in other populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1010539510379394">34</xref></sup> appropriate interventions will be needed to facilitate this transition.</p>
<p>This study benefits from having a population-based sample that was recruited with a high response rate. The ranges and quartiles of physical activity levels as well as the CVD risk indicators in the sample are likely to accurately reflect the ranges in the target population. The use of internationally standardized protocols and the careful training of data collection staff ensure the accuracy of the data obtained. The comprehensive measure of physical activity across all domains and the availability of data on other behavioral risk factors for CVD allowed us to examine the associations and adjust for several potential confounders.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to this study. First, the use of GPAQ to measure physical activity has been shown to have limitations, especially when used in women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510379394">23</xref></sup> Although the use of a more accurate measurement of physical activity by objective instruments would be ideal, such information has not been obtained in population-based settings in developing countries of Asia. The self-report measurements of physical activity by questionnaires provide important information to facilitate the preliminary understanding of the complex association between physical activity and CVD in these populations. This will in turn provide more insight into how physical activity should be assessed in these populations. Second, we did not measure other important risk factors for CVD, including total energy, dietary salt, and saturated fat intake. Failing to adjust for these factors may have influenced the findings.</p>
