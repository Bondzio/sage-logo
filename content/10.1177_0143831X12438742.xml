<abstract>
<p>Workplace bullying has often been attributed to work-related stress, and has been linked to the Job Demand Control Model. The current study aims to further these studies by testing the model for bullying in a heterogeneous sample and by using latent class (LC)-analyses to define different demands and control groups and targets of severe bullying. High job demands were associated with a higher probability of being a target of severe bullying, which was particularly true for the very high job demands group. Low job control was also associated with a higher probability of being a target of severe bullying. Moreover, high job control buffered the negative effects of job demands on being a target of severe bullying, particularly when employees reported very little job control and high/very high job demands. Overall, the JDC-Model was supported, suggesting that being a target of severe bullying can be considered as a social behavioural strain.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, scientific attention on workplace bullying has increased significantly, with ever more publications exploring its prevalence, consequences and antecedents. Following the work environment hypothesis, reports of workplace bullying can be attributed to a poor work environment. A large number of exploratory studies have brought a laundry list of work-related factors associated with bullying: high job demands, low job control, low social support, elevated levels of role conflicts and role ambiguity, many changes at work, elevated levels of job insecurity and inadequate information flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X12438742">Baillien and De Witte, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X12438742">Einarsen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12438742">Hauge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X12438742">Hubert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X12438742">Leymann, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143831X12438742">Neyens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0143831X12438742">Notelaers and De Witte, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0143831X12438742">Opdebeeck et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0143831X12438742">Vartia, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0143831X12438742">Zapf, 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0143831X12438742">Zapf and Gross, 2001</xref>). The list of such psychosocial job characteristics related to bullying is long, yet most studies report only bivariate relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143831X12438742">Moayed et al., 2006</xref>) and lack theoretical rationale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X12438742">Aquino and Thau, 2009</xref>). Consequently, our knowledge of the relationships between job characteristics and bullying is limited and fragmented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12438742">Hauge et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, bullying research has shifted towards theoretical frameworks that can explain in more detail why different job characteristics may be associated with exposure to bullying, further enhancing our understanding of the workplace bullying phenomenon (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X12438742">Baillien and De Witte, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X12438742">De Cuyper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al., 2010</xref>). In that respect, scholars have linked exposure to bullying to the Job Demand Control Model (‘JDC-Model’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X12438742">Karasek, 1979</xref>), arguing, in particularly, that the combination of low job control and high job demands makes employees vulnerable to workplace bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X12438742">Einarsen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X12438742">Leymann, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143831X12438742">Neuman and Baron (2003)</xref> argued that employees confronted with work-related stress will distance themselves from the cause (e.g. invest less effort in goal accomplishment). Such a coping strategy may lead to violation of work-related expectations and social norms, which, in turn, may ignite negative reactions from other organizational members (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X12438742">Hoel and Salin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X12438742">Hoel et al., 1999</xref>) and thus result in reports of workplace bullying. In line with this, the present study investigates whether the JDC-Model is valuable in explaining the probability of being a victim of workplace bullying. Since workplace bullying is an occupational hazard that needs to be managed, we especially draw attention to a meaningful, yet non-arbitrary operationalization of the interaction between demands and control; with the aim of indicating the levels of demands and control associated with bullying.</p>

<title>Workplace bullying</title>
<p>Bullying at work means harassing, offending and socially excluding someone over a lengthy period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X12438742">Einarsen et al., 2011</xref>). Workplace bullying has been defined as persistent exposure to negative behaviours at work that may take the form of work-related acts, personal acts, or social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X12438742">Cowie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0143831X12438742">Notelaers, 2011</xref>). These behaviours can be expressed in many ways, such as spreading rumours, threatening a person, belittling a person’s achievements and organizing work in such a way that a person is likely to fail or suffer unnecessarily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X12438742">Einarsen, 2000</xref>). Bullying, moreover, reflects a process in which negative behaviour becomes more intense and frequent over time, leaving the target in an inferior position. Workplace bullying forms a severe threat to employees’ health and well-being, with targets often showing decreased job satisfaction, symptoms of depression, fear, irritation and a range of psychosomatic complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X12438742">Brousse et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143831X12438742">Niedhammer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0143831X12438742">Rodríguez-Muñoz et al., 2009</xref>). In extreme cases, targets of bullying may even commit suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X12438742">Balducci et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, two approaches have been used to measure exposure to workplace bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143831X12438742">Nielsen, 2009</xref>). In the first approach, the self-labelling method, respondents indicate how often they have been subjected to workplace bullying during the last six months based on a definition of the phenomenon. In the second approach, the behavioural experience method, the respondent indicates how often during the last six months he or she experienced each of a list of specific negative behaviours that may be perceived as bullying when repeated, such as rumours being spread about one, exposure to persistent criticism, being made a laughing stock. As for the self-labelling approach, targets are then differentiated from non-targets by employing a simple cut-off criterion. Following the ‘Leymann criterion’, for example, respondents are labelled as targets when they have experienced at least one negative act from the list on at least a weekly basis ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X12438742">Leymann, 1990a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143831X12438742">1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143831X12438742">Nielsen, 2009</xref>). Commonly used questionnaires in this context are the Leymann Inventory of Psychosocial Terror (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143831X12438742">Leymann, 1990b</xref>) and the Negative Acts Questionnaire which has been extensively validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X12438742">Einarsen and Raknes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X12438742">Einarsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143831X12438742">Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al., 2006a</xref>). The two methods, however, reveal different prevalence rates. Whereas the self-labelling approach produces a rather conservative estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X12438742">Einarsen et al., 2009</xref>), applying simple cut-off scores to the behavioural experience approach is considered to produce a liberal estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143831X12438742">Nielsen et al., 2011</xref>). A meta-analysis confirmed this: the number of targets exposed to bullying measured by the behavioural experience approach appeared to be higher as compared to the self-labelling approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143831X12438742">Nielsen et al., 2010</xref>). Using latent class (LC)-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143831X12438742">McCutcheon, 1987</xref>), a technique that classifies respondents in various target groups based on their response pattern to the items of the behavioural experience method, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al. (2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0143831X12438742">2006b</xref>) recently seem to have closed the gap between these two approaches. Specifically, LC-analyses on a sample of Belgian employees<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0143831X12438742">1</xref></sup> revealed six clusters reflecting different combinations of bullying acts encountered and showing increasing levels of gravity. A first group of respondents, the ‘not bullied’ cluster, reported no exposure to the negative behaviours. A second group reported a rather low exposure to mainly work-related negative behaviours (i.e. the ‘limited work criticism’ cluster). A third group was subjected to a limited amount of both work- and person-related criticism (i.e. the ‘limited negative encounters’ cluster). A fourth group was subjected to a range of negative behaviours, yet mainly ‘now and then’ (i.e. the ‘sometimes bullied’ cluster). A fifth group, the ‘targets of work-related bullying’ cluster comprises respondents who reported frequent exposure to various work-related negative behaviours but less frequent exposure to personal degrading behaviours. The sixth and last group, the ‘targets of severe bullying’ cluster, was the only group showing a high probability to be subjected to any type of bullying behaviour, even on a weekly basis. Hence these employees were surely targets of recurring negative behaviours. In addition, only the sixth cluster, the targets of severe bullying, revealed the expected decrease in pleasure at work and increased work-related distress noted among self-declared victims of workplace bullying (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0143831X12438742">Zapf et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, this group fits the workplace bullying definition best, i.e. being a target of recurring and frequent negative behaviour. Consequently, the present study specifically focuses on this the last cluster and in particular on the probability of being a target of severe bullying, which will then be used as the dependent variable when testing our hypotheses.</p>

<title>The Job Demand Control Model and bullying</title>
<p>The JDC-Model distinguishes between two dimensions, namely ‘job demands’ (i.e. pace and amount of work) and ‘job control’ (i.e. decision authority and skill discretion). The JDC-Model can be interpreted as a stimulus-response model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0143831X12438742">Taris and Kompier, 2004</xref>) in which job demands and job control lead to the development of work-related stress (i.e. ‘the strain hypothesis’) or to learning and motivation (i.e. ‘the learning hypothesis’). Regarding the strain hypothesis, the model assumes that (high) job demands and (low) job control lead to strain outcomes (i.e. two main effects). Regarding the learning hypothesis, the model states that (high) job demands and (high) job control increase learning and motivation. The model moreover states that the combination of job demands and job control has an additional effect that exceeds the sum of the main effects (i.e. interaction effect). Specifically, based on the specific combination of job demands and job control, four types of jobs can be distinguished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X12438742">Karasek, 1979</xref>). Regarding the strain hypothesis, employees with <italic>high strain jobs</italic> (i.e. high job demands and low job control) show high scores on strain-related outcomes, such as lack of psychological and physical well-being. Employees working in <italic>low strain jobs</italic> (i.e. low job demands and high job control) develop a lower than average level of strain-related outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X12438742">De Lange, 2005</xref>). Regarding the learning hypothesis, <italic>active jobs</italic> (i.e. high job demands and high job control) lead to high levels of intrinsic motivation for learning and personal growth. <italic>Passive jobs</italic> (i.e. low job demands and low job control) decrease the overall activity level including reduced problem solving, which, in turn, has been linked to the concept of learned helplessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0143831X12438742">Seligman, 1975</xref>). The current study particularly draws on the strain hypothesis linking job demands and job control to strain. In this respect, the JDC-Model is supported regarding a certain outcome when both main effects and/or the interaction effect are confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X12438742">De Lange et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The JDC-Model’s strain hypothesis has been applied to a broad range of outcomes, such as physical health outcomes (e.g. coronary heart disease, blood pressure, muscle tension; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X12438742">Kristensen, 1995</xref>), psychological well-being (e.g. anxiety, depression; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0143831X12438742">Van der Doef and Maes, 1999</xref>), job-related well-being (e.g. job satisfaction, sickness absence, burnout; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X12438742">De Jonge et al., 1998</xref>) and behavioural outcomes such as work performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0143831X12438742">Sargent and Terry, 2000</xref>), turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0143831X12438742">Verhofstadt et al., 2009</xref>) and smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0143831X12438742">Otten et al., 1999</xref>). Recently, scholars have extended this list by applying the JDC-Model to exposure to workplace bullying; indicating that exposure to bullying can indeed be regarded as social strain. Specifically, it has been argued that these work-related factors may elicit frustration or stress that may in turn translate into exposure to bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X12438742">Baillien et al., 2009</xref>). By distancing him- or herself from the stressful work situation the employee may gradually violate existing norms and habits within the team or the organization (e.g. decreasing the level of work efforts, withdrawal behaviour, violating social expectations). This may cause others to adopt a negative attitude towards the frustrated employee, which may open the door for punitive and retaliatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X12438742">Felson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143831X12438742">Neuman and Baron, 2003</xref>). Similarly, stressful work may wear out the employee’s resources. He or she may then become an ‘easy target’ who offers little resistance against workplace bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X12438742">Hoel and Salin, 2003</xref>). In line with this theorizing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0143831X12438742">Zapf et al. (1996)</xref> detected ‘high stress’ as the fourth most often quoted reason by targets to explain the bullying situation.</p>
<p>Two studies have found support for explaining reports of workplace bullying with the JDC-Model. A study among 716 Australian frontline police officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0143831X12438742">Tuckey et al., 2009</xref>) found high levels of job demands combined with low levels of job control in targets’ and observers’ reports of workplace bullying. Similarly, a study among matched samples of Spanish and Belgian blue-collar workers (<italic>N</italic> = 319) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X12438742">Baillien et al., 2011b</xref>) also found support for the JDC-Model’s strain hypothesis. In the Spanish sample, results revealed a positive main effect of workload and a negative main effect of autonomy. The relationship between workload and bullying was particularly strong under the condition of low autonomy (i.e. interaction). In the Belgian sample, a positive main effect of workload and a significant workload–autonomy interaction effect in accordance with the strain hypothesis were reported. While these studies clearly add value to the workplace bullying research domain, they provide limited evidence and can be strengthened in at least three ways.</p>
<p>First, these studies were conducted among fairly homogeneous samples (i.e. blue-collar workers and police officers), making it difficult to generalize their findings to a heterogeneous working population. Therefore, the current study aims to add to this line of research by testing whether the JDC-Model may explain exposure to workplace bullying in a large and heterogeneous sample of employees. Second, the measurement and in particular the conceptualization of workplace bullying of both studies can be improved. Whereas bullying from a target perspective is commonly defined as exposure to intense and recurring negative behaviour (see earlier), the Belgian–Spanish study primarily focused on bullying in a very early stage because it measured or conceived workplace bullying as an interval scale where items’ scores are summed. Due to the highly skewed nature of workplace bullying such an approach does not really tap into the definitional core of bullying which is recurring negative behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0143831X12438742">Notelaers, 2011</xref>). The Australian study defined targets of bullying based on a self-labelling approach (see earlier) which may be a far too conservative estimate for the prevalence of workplace bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X12438742">Einarsen et al., 2009</xref>). In the current study, we want to advance bullying research by drawing on recent developments in modelling workplace bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143831X12438742">Nielsen et al., 2011</xref>), which shows that LC-analyses are, both from a methodological and a theoretical perspective, useful to model and identify exposure to recurring negative behaviour. LC-analyses allow discerning victims (i.e. targets of severe bullying) from other target groups and non-exposed employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0143831X12438742">2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0143831X12438742">2011</xref>). Therefore, the current study will apply the LC-technique to define targets of bullying. As a result bullying can be conceived as the probability to be a target of severe bullying. Third, in order to manage bullying in the workplace it may be beneficial to identify the levels of control and demands that are related to an increase or decrease in workplace bullying. Both former studies used interval scales to assess job demands and job control. While theoretically sound, the use of interaction terms – either in the form of a product or an addition of interval scales such as demands and control – does provide thresholds which managers may use to intervene in order to prevent workplace bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X12438742">Leka et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, we employ LC-analyses to identify empirically different levels of job demands and job control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0143831X12438742">Vanroelen et al., 2009</xref>). By expanding the LC-approach to job demands and job control we establish in a non-arbitrary way the different levels of demands and control employees’ experience. This enables us to grasp the meaning of the levels of demands and control more accurately compared to median split approaches typically used to define low and high levels of demands and control. Indeed, median split has been associated with a range of statistical problems such as overestimation of the effects of the predictor variables, and may be conceived as a fairly arbitrary way to categorize job demands and job control (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X12438742">Irwin and McClelland, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X12438742">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X12438742">MacCallum et al., 2002</xref>). Since LC-analysis enables researchers to establish heterogeneity in a non- arbitrary way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143831X12438742">Magidson and Vermunt, 2004</xref>), we apply this approach to detect empirically the number of different exposure levels respondents experience with regard to job demands and job control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0143831X12438742">Vanroelen et al., 2009</xref>). As a result, the interaction of non-arbitrary established levels of demands and control can be thoroughly assessed in order to explore thresholds regarding exposure to workplace bullying.</p>
<p>Following the JDC-Model’s strain hypotheses, we first assume a main effect of both job demands and job control on the probability of being a target of severe bullying:</p>

<sec id="section4-0143831X12438742">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Between 2003 and 2006, a total of 9363 questionnaires were collected in 30 Belgian organizations. The mean response rate in these surveys was 70%. Participation among employees was voluntary and anonymity was guaranteed. A small majority were male respondents, with 44% being female. The mean age of the respondents was 40.5 (SD = 10) and the mean tenure was 12 years (SD = 11). The distribution across occupations was as follows: 8% blue-collar workers, 88% white-collar workers (32% employees, 8% low managerial, 11% higher managerial and 33% public servants) and 8% social workers or (assistant) nurses. With respect to industrial sectors and branches, 22% worked in manufacturing industries, 37% in the service sector, 33% in the governmental services and 7% in the public health sector. Hence, this heterogeneous sample covers a wide range of different occupations and industries within Belgium.</p>

<sec id="section5-0143831X12438742">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>Workplace bullying was measured with a 16-item version of the Negative Acts Questionnaire (NAQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X12438742">Einarsen and Raknes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al., 2006b</xref>) covering work-related acts, person-oriented acts and social isolation. Respondents were asked to indicate how often they had been subjected to these behaviours during the last six months. The response categories were ‘never’, ‘now and then’, ‘once a month’ and ‘once a week or more often’. A sample item reads as follows: ‘Social exclusion from co-workers or work group activities’. This measure had a satisfactory reliability (α = .89).</p>
<p>Job demands were measured with three items from the Short Inventory to Monitor Psychosocial Hazards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al., 2007</xref>). Job control was assessed in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X12438742">Karasek’s (1979)</xref> original conceptualization that includes three sub-dimensions; skill utilization (5 items) (α = .83), autonomy (11 items) (α = .91) and participation (7 items) (α = .89) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X12438742">Karasek, 1979</xref>: 289). All sub-dimensions were tapped using the items of Questionnaire Experience and Evaluation of Work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0143831X12438742">Van Veldhoven and Meijman, 1994</xref>). An example item of job demands is: ‘Do you have to work fast?’ Example items of control read as ‘Does your job offer you opportunities for personal growth and development?’, ‘Can you influence your pace of work?’ and ‘Can you participate in decisions affecting areas related to your work?’ Four response categories were offered to the respondents: ‘never’, ‘sometimes’, ‘often’ and ‘always’. Both job demands (α = .82) and job control (α = .85) had a satisfactory reliability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0143831X12438742">
<title>Preliminary analyses</title>
<p>First, we identified the targets of severe bullying by estimating the different target groups of bullying employing LC-analyses in Latent Gold 4.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0143831X12438742">Vermunt and Magidson, 2009</xref>). In line with earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X12438742">Einarsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0143831X12438742">Nielsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al., 2006b</xref>), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143831X12438742">Magidson and Vermunt, 2004</xref>) was used to determine the best suitable number of clusters. The BIC was lowest in a six LC-solution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0143831X12438742">2</xref></sup> This LC-solution revealed a similar average conditional probability structure to belong to each of the target groups as detected in the aforementioned studies applying LC-analyses. Following the modal assignment rule for classification, in which subjects are assigned to the cluster yielding the highest classification probability, 35.2% of the employees were categorized as ‘not bullied at all’, while 28.5% were classified in the ‘limited work criticism’ group. Another 17.4% belonged to ‘limited negative encounters’ group, while 6.7% comprised the ‘sometimes bullied’ group and 9.4% comprised the ‘work-related bullying’ group. Finally, 2.8% of the employees belonged to the ‘target of severe bullying’ group. Hence, the LC results revealed the existence of different target groups of workplace bullying in function of the frequency and nature of the reported bullying acts. However, strictly speaking only one cluster clearly reports persistent or repeated and prolonged exposure to negative acts, i.e. the victims cluster. The other clusters contain targets less persistently and consistently targeted. Therefore, the probability of being classified as a victim of workplace bullying according to the LC results is defined as the dependent variable in the current study. This probability is an interval variable which varies between 0 and 1 .</p>
<p>To explore the levels of demands and control that are related to exposure to work-related bullying, a traditional factor or scale approach is not of much help because thresholds on such scales are unidentified. Distinguishing empirically such thresholds or groups in function of the level of demands and control can however be achieved with LC-models. In particular latent class factor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0143831X12438742">Vermunt and Magidson, 2005</xref>), where categories of the latent variable are ordered, are suited to construct thresholds in a non-arbitrary way. Therefore, we similarly determined the number of job demands and job control groups using LC-analyses. Regarding job demands, the analyses yielded the lowest BIC in a four-cluster solution. The conditional probabilities revealed that approximately 9% of the employees experienced almost ‘no job demands’. Fifty percent sometimes worked under some pressure, thus reporting ‘low job demands’. One-third of the employees reported ‘high job demands’. Finally, approximately 8% of the employees belonged to those who almost always experienced ‘very high job demands’. Regarding job control, the LC-analyses also showed the lowest BIC in a four-class solution, too. Approximately 14% belonged to the group that reported ‘very little job control’. Altogether, 43% belonged to a ‘low job control’ group, while approximately 35% of the respondents were classified in a ‘high job control’ group. Almost 8% of the employees were classified in the ‘very high job control’ group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0143831X12438742">3</xref></sup> Interestingly, these analyses did not support dividing the sample into high vs low levels of demands and job control; as one would conventionally do in the JDC- Model’s research domain to portray the interaction. Instead, based on the LC-analyses, we used four levels of both job demands and job control (and their interaction) as predictors of being a target of severe workplace bullying.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Hypotheses were tested by means of a multivariate analysis (MANOVA; SPSS 15). The MANOVA procedure (<italic>F</italic> = 23.64, d.f. = 15) showed that all predictors, i.e. demands (<italic>F</italic> = 5.16, d.f. = 3), job control (<italic>F</italic> = 54.29, d.f. = 3) and their interaction (<italic>F</italic> = 2.50, d.f. = 9) were significant (α &lt; .009).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0143831X12438742">4</xref></sup> The Bonferroni pair-wise comparison tests were used to inspect whether differences between the levels of demands and job control were significant (α &lt; .05).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X12438742">Table 1</xref> demonstrates how the probability to be a target of severe bullying varied with the four levels of job demands and job control. The overall probability of being a target of severe bullying is printed in the lower right part of the table (i.e. 3%). Regarding job demands, employees who face ‘very high’ job demands were two times more likely to be a target of severe bullying as compared to the overall probability. Moreover, this probability seemed to increase when going from ‘very low’ to ‘very high’ job demands. This was not however supported by the Bonferroni pair-wise comparison test: the probability of being a target of severe bullying did not differ significantly between ‘very low job demands’ and ‘low job demands’, and between ‘very low’ job demands and ‘high job’ demands. Only the ‘very high’ job demands differed significantly from the other groups. Hence, when employees were facing ‘very high’ job demands, the probability of being a target of severe bullying increased significantly. Hypothesis 1 is thus confirmed, however with nuanced knowledge that only the ‘very high’ job demands group differed from the other job demands groups.</p>

<p>With regard to job control, employees reporting ‘very low’ job control were almost four times more likely to be a target of severe bullying as compared to the overall probability. Yet, the Bonferroni test revealed that the probability of being a target of severe bullying for the ‘very high’ job control group did not significantly differ from the ‘high’ job control group. The ‘very high’ and ‘high’ job control groups differed significantly from the ‘low’ and ‘very low’ job control groups. Moreover, in view of the probability of being a target of severe bullying, the ‘low’ and ‘very low’ job control group differed significantly from each other, too. Thus, in line with hypothesis 2, the probability of being a target of severe bullying increased significantly when workers experience ‘low’ and in particular ‘very low’ job control.</p>
<p>With regard to the interaction effect, the probabilities of being a target of severe bullying across different combinations of the four job demands and four job control groups are presented in the body of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X12438742">Table 1</xref>. In all, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X12438742">Table 1</xref> demonstrates that when job demands were ‘high’/‘very high’ and job control was ‘very low’, the probability of being a target of severe bullying increased strongly. When job control was ‘high’, this probability decreases. Hence, job control buffers to some extent the negative effect of higher job demands. Hypothesis 3 is thus confirmed. A Bonferroni pair-wise comparison procedure made it possible to compare the likelihood of being severely bullied among respondents who experience low strain with those who experience high strain. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X12438742">Table 1</xref>, the high strain groups (low – very low control to high – very high demands) according to the JDC-Model are printed in bold and underlined. The low strain groups (high – very high control to low – very low demands) are printed in both italics and bold. According to the Bonferroni pair-wise comparison test, within the low strain groups (high – very high control to low – very low demands), the probability of being severely bullied did not differ significantly. Respondents in the low strain groups had a zero probability of being severely bullied. However, the probability of .04 associated with the first cell in the high strain group (high demands – low control) is significantly higher than the probabilities associated with the low strain groups, again supporting the strain hypothesis. Experiencing ‘high’ demands and ‘low’ control was thus associated with a significant increase in the likelihood of being severely bullied. This finding therefore yields a threshold for exposure to workplace bullying. Furthermore, it is noted that the probability of being classified as a target of severe bullying is significantly higher – almost twice as high (7% vs 4%) – when control is ‘low’ and demands are ‘very high’ (compared to high demands). Hence, facing ‘very high’ demands compared to facing ‘high’ demands when having ‘low’ control, seems to point to another threshold. Moreover, the probability of being a target of severe bullying that is associated with ‘very low’ control and ‘high’ demands, which is .13, is significantly higher than the above-reported .07. Hence, a new threshold emerges. Finally, in the upper right corner, the probability of being a target of severe bullying is reported for employees who experience ‘very high’ job demands and ‘very low’ control. This probability of .15 is not significantly different from the probability of .13 that was associated with the ‘low’ control and ‘very high’ demands group. However, the probability of .15 is again significantly higher than the probability .04 and .07, indicating another threshold and again supporting the strain hypothesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Numerous scholars have attributed workplace bullying to job characteristics and psychosocial factors at work; a viewpoint that has often been referred to as the work environment hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X12438742">Einarsen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12438742">Hauge et al., 2007</xref>). This framework claims that the bullying process is fuelled by a stressful and discordant work environment, reflected in, for example, stressful jobs, an inadequate work organization and deficient leadership practices. Following this hypothesis, scholars have explored whether the well- established JDC-Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X12438742">Karasek, 1979</xref>) may explain why an employee may become a target of bullying, confirming that job demands and job control indeed explain variance in workplace bullying. Our study aimed to replicate and advance this line of research by (a) employing a highly heterogeneous sample and (b) by using the recently introduced LC-approach to define targets of severe bullying. Moreover (c), we also defined the different job demands and job control groups using LC-analyses proving more nuanced and empirically based thresholds of demands and control. Our results supported our expectations. Specifically, in line with hypothesis 1, high job demands were associated with a higher probability of being a target of severe bullying. Our results moreover refined this main effect of job demands on being a target of severe bullying and revealed that particularly the rather small ‘very high’ job demands group was associated with a higher probability of being a target of severe bullying. The probability of being a target of severe bullying did not differ between the groups reporting ‘very low’, ‘low’ and ‘high’ job demands. ‘Low’ job control was also associated with a higher probability of being a target of severe bullying (i.e. main effect of control). The ‘very low’, ‘low’ and ‘high’ job control groups all revealed different and increasing probabilities of being a target of severe bullying, confirming hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 3 was supported as well: high job control buffered the negative effects of job demands on being a target of severe bullying. Or, workers with high strain jobs (i.e. ‘high’ job demands and ‘low’ job control) were more likely to be a target of severe bullying than workers in low strain jobs (i.e. ‘low’ job demands and ‘high’ job control). Again, our findings refined the ‘traditional’ perspective on high strain jobs for being a target of severe bullying. Among employees experiencing ‘high’ and ‘very high’ job control, the relationship between job demands and bullying was practically absent. However, when employees reported ‘low’ control together with ‘high’ (or ‘very high’) demands the probability to be severely bullied increased. When employees reported ‘very low’ job control and ‘high’/‘very high’ job demands, the probability to be a target of severe bullying increased strongly: in this situation, employees were up to five times more likely to be a target of severe bullying. In other words, the significant job demands * job control interaction was mainly due to a situation in which employees are simultaneously confronted with ‘very low’ job control and ‘high’/‘very high’ job demands.</p>
<p>Overall, the JDC-Model was thus supported for being a target of severe bullying, which aligns with earlier indications that work-related factors may contribute to the risk of being a target of bullying through a stress process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X12438742">Baillien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X12438742">Hoel and Salin, 2003</xref>) and confirms that being a target of severe bullying may indeed be considered as a social behavioural strain. Our findings also revealed that the probability of being a target of severe bullying was more strongly related to job control than to job demands. This finding underlines earlier assumptions that particularly a lack of resources may force a potential target into a position where it is difficult to defend him or herself against negative acts at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X12438742">Björkqvist et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X12438742">Brodsky, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0143831X12438742">Zapf and Einarsen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Note moreover that the JDC-Model accounts for only 5% of the variance in the probability of being a target of severe workplace bullying, highlighting both strengths and possible shortcomings of the model to account for the probability of being a target of severe bullying. First, this may be an artefact of the statistical procedure used here. With the aim to test in detail the interaction effect, a MANOVA is a straightforward choice. The MANOVA, however, may underestimate the amount of explained variance, as additional analyses suggest. When testing the job demands and job control as scales in a binomial regression model contrasting not bullied respondents with victims, the Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> of 31.4% revealed a considerable amount of explained variance. Second, these findings may hint at the multi-causal nature of workplace bullying which has been discussed by several scholars in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X12438742">Baillien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X12438742">Einarsen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0143831X12438742">Zapf, 1999b</xref>). In this context, studies in the realm of the work environment hypothesis have revealed a range of antecedents besides job demands and job control that may add to the understanding of workplace bullying (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X12438742">Baillien et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12438742">Hauge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X12438742">Einarsen et al. (1994)</xref>, for example, referred to role conflict as the only job characteristic able to explain bullying across occupations and industries. Other important factors included role ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X12438742">Einarsen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0143831X12438742">Vartia, 1996</xref>), organizational change, mergers and job insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X12438742">Baillien and De Witte, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X12438742">Lewis and Sheehan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0143831X12438742">Salin, 2003</xref>); variables that are not accounted for in the JDC-Model. Alternatively, scholars have described other processes than stress that may lead to being a target of bullying, such as escalation of conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X12438742">Baillien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X12438742">Leymann, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0143831X12438742">Zapf and Gross, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Strengths, limitations and future research</title>
<p>The current study has several contributions and strengths. Regarding strengths, we specifically tested the extent the JDC-Model accounts for targets of severe bullying by employing a LC-approach. Different target groups were first estimated by LC-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al., 2006b</xref>) that yield class membership probabilities, including the probability of being a target of severe workplace bullying. In response to problems associated with the median split (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X12438742">Irwin and McClelland, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X12438742">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X12438742">MacCallum et al., 2002</xref>), we did not arbitrarily determine but rather empirically estimated different levels of both demands and control with an LC-approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0143831X12438742">Vanroelen et al., 2009</xref>), showing that bullying was particularly associated with extreme low levels of control. Using this LC-approach, Karasek’s JDC-Model was supported for being a target of severe bullying in a heterogeneous sample; further enhancing insight in the workplace bullying research domain. This result moreover reveal quite nuanced findings regarding the strain hypothesis: when little control is experienced and employees are confronted with very high demands, this is associated with a substantive increase of the probability of being a target of severe bullying.</p>
<p>Yet, the present study has some notable limitations as well. Our study applied a cross-sectional research design which does not allow for claims on causality. Strictly speaking, we do not know whether job control and job demands are predictors, consequences or merely correlates of being a target of severe bullying. A recent longitudinal study however showed that workload and autonomy precede rather than follow workplace bullying measured as an interval scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X12438742">Baillien et al., 2011a</xref>), underlining the relevance of our findings for theory and practice. Second, although a social support measure was to our disposition, our study applied the basic JDC-Model and did not include social support as operationalized in the Job Demand Control Support Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X12438742">Johnson and Hall, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143831X12438742">Karasek and Theorell, 1990</xref>). Social support refers to overall levels of helpful social interaction available on the job from both co-workers and supervisors. Adding support as a moderator in explaining workplace bullying in a cross-sectional design would lead to a tautological association because the absence of a helpful social interaction aligns too strongly with the concept of workplace bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143831X12438742">Notelaers et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, incorporating social support as a moderator implies not only a thorough analysis of the relationships between social support and workplace bullying but also the need for a longitudinal design to precisely discern these relationships. Third, we relied on the individual’s perception of the work environment since no organizational or departmental information about the predictors and the dependent variable was available. Future research addressing the JDC-Model and workplace bullying may, however, benefit from collecting organizational data employing a multilevel analysis to test more thoroughly the work environment hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X12438742">Hauge et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Practical implications</title>
<p>The present study further supports the hypothesis that a stressful job situation may make employees prone to becoming a target of workplace bullying: job demands, job control and their interplay are related with being a target of severe workplace bullying. With the LC-techniques, we were able to distinguish empirically different levels of job control and job demands which assisted in the refinement of earlier findings. In addition, the use of such more advanced statistical techniques also allows making precise suggestions for the prevention of workplace bullying. Refining both job demands and control may, in particular, be interesting for primary and secondary prevention of workplace bullying. In primary prevention the emergence of the conditions that may lead to workplace bullying is dealt with. The current test of the demand of the JDC-Model suggests how jobs should be designed. If jobs are designed in such a way that they to not bear the seeds of workplace bullying, employees should not be brought into two situations or conditions: i.e. having very high demands while having low control and having high demands while having no control. A way to prevent workplace bullying from happening may consist of building platform for employees where they can voice their concerns without risking punitive measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X12438742">Hoel et al., 2002</xref>). In a global competing world, such situations will emerge eventually and evolve in workplace bullying. Therefore, prevention should not halt with job design it should also foresee the emergence of such conditions and construct the necessary tools to deal with the escalation into workplace bullying. A risk control system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X12438742">Cox, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143831X12438742">Leka and Cox, 2008</xref>), where the risk factors are monitored and intervention strategies are accordingly designed, is a valuable way to foresee the emergence of the conditions that lead to stress and ill health. Such a system may be used for workplace bullying as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0143831X12438742">Spurgeon, 2003</xref>). In such a system an early warning signal can be construed to signal where thresholds (as discussed earlier) have been attained, allowing prevention to investigate the job or functions at risk. The latter is a necessary condition for the further development of intervention plans to prevent bullying and should entail job redesign, if possible. Such an intervention effort should of course not only be limited to assess and control exiting levels of existing demands and control, only. Understanding why job demands are high and understanding why control is low or very limited may offer valuable ways to discover new opportunities for control that are apt.</p>
