<p>This special issue contains a selection of the papers presented at the international symposium entitled ‘Foundations of Enactive Cognitive Science’, which was held in Windsor, UK, in February 2012. In organizing this symposium, our explicit goal was to create the space for researchers attracted to the concept of enaction to discuss the research agenda(s) for what could be described as an alternative or an extension to the orthodox paradigm(s) in cognitive science. About 70 researchers represented the five continents, and a dozen of academic disciplines. More extensive proceedings of the event can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://reading.ac.uk/cinn/enactivism">http://reading.ac.uk/cinn/enactivism</ext-link>, including videos of the talks and the panel discussion, graciously hosted on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://youtube.com/aisbtube">http://youtube.com/aisbtube</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Cognitive science came to be in a very particular technological context. At the end of the 1950s, researchers from disciplines as diverse as philosophy, psychology, anthropology, linguistics, neuroscience and computer science, sat together for the first time at the same symposium; an event that would redefine the very nature of the research agenda into cognition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059712313483418">Miller (2003)</xref>, who attended the symposium, remembers that discussions to that effect sparked from a paper by Alan Newell and Herbert Simon describing their ‘logic theory machine’, a computer implementation of some of Alfred Whitehead and Bertrand Russell’s inference rules, taken from their opus <italic>Principia Mathematica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059712313483418">1927</xref>). Miller tells us that he<disp-quote>
<p>… left the symposium with a conviction, more intuitive than rational, that experimental psychology, theoretical linguistics, and the computer simulation of cognitive processes were all pieces from a larger whole and that the future would see a progressive elaboration and coordination of their shared concerns.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Around the same time, mathematicians and engineers were designing the first computers, thereby giving birth to what would be coined the field of computer science. Modelling work by Newell, Simon and others would soon give rise to a field of research in its own right, artificial intelligence – dubbed as such at another famous symposium, at the same period.</p>
<p>The paths of development of these fields of interest have since met on many occasions, and advancements on one side have had tremendous influence over the theories, models and implementations/experiments produced on the other side. One such influence in cognitive science no doubt resides in the description of some of the features ascribed to the workings of the mind in general, and the brain in particular. Computationalism, for instance, a theoretical stance proposing that the basic information processing unit may be modular and operating over representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059712313483418">Dretske, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059712313483418">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059712313483418">Fodor, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059712313483418">Fodor &amp; Pylyshyn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059712313483418">Putnam, 1961</xref>), serves as the backbone for much of the research that happens today, often covertly. Importantly, these representations may be thought of as internal models of the outside world, representing the laws and affordances that make the world what it is, supporting sense making. It is easy to sense the resonance between these ideas and developments in computer science and artificial intelligence, related to algorithms, programming languages or some of the techniques developed in the scope of ‘good old fashioned AI’.</p>
<p>Over the last 20 years or so, however, some researchers grew dissatisfied with the ability of the orthodox paradigms to answer fundamental questions related to phenomenal experience, and their inability to account for what can be observed in the brain. Colour perception, for instance, is one typical case that seems to defy generations of neuroscientists and engineers, despite being/having been one of most studied aspects of cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059712313483418">Solomon and Lennie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059712313483418">Felsen and Dan, 2005</xref>). At the forefront of this movement, biologists, physicists and philosophers attempt to reunite theories about cognition with the biological nature of the interaction between the organism and the environment, which gives rise to a particular experience. These researchers emphasize that the brain is embodied, and that the body is embedded in a dynamic environment. They include features of situatedness and embodiment to the definition of cognition, and propose to restate the notion of computation and information processing in the brain, to include the dynamical adjustments that occur at the levels of the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as in the body’s homeostatic and immune systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059712313483418">Roesch, Nasuto, &amp; Bishop, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>This theoretical move has far-reaching consequences. First, without necessarily invalidating previous results, opening up the definition of cognition in this way implies that much is still unknown, and that current theories and models are incomplete. Second, if experience is unreachable, or at best badly described by current theories and models, then great effort is necessary to devise entirely new empirical methods, to restate old questions and provide new and more complete answers. Finally, taking into account the technological context that saw the first cognitive revolution shape the way we see ourselves, grounded in the computer metaphor, it is legitimate – and exciting! – to imagine the deep impact that such a broader perspective will have over future generations of theories and models, and for our society at large.</p>
<p>The articles included in this special issue address very different points and serve very different purposes. Overall, the intention is to describe some of the challenges faced by enaction, and to introduce applications of the paradigm to very specific empirical questions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the concept of representations is present in most of the submissions, if not all of them.</p>
<p>Daniel Hutto formulates energetic replies to two ‘response strategies’ put forth by people who use action-oriented representations to make traditional approaches more embodied. A radically enactive approach to cognition (REC), he argues, will leave off the concept of representation altogether, and will not disguise it by refactoring its content (its interpretation) or its vehicle (its implementation). In his words, REC is dealing with the ‘hard problem of content’ and challenges the notion of informational content.</p>
<p>David Silverman takes a more focused outlook at the question of representations by responding to Clark’s criticisms of O’Regan and Noë’s sensorimotor account of perceptual experience. In a similar way to Hutto, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059712313483418">O’Regan, and Noë (2001)</xref> reject the need for representations by arguing that perception and cognition arise from the bodily exploration of the outside world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059712313483418">Clark (2006)</xref> uses the experience of temporal duration to describe what he thinks are the limits to O’Regan and Noë’s proposal, an argument that Silverman rejects vehemently by emphasizing the temporal aspects of the interaction with the environment.</p>
<p>Mario Villalobos discusses the nature of the enactive movement, by describing some of the theoretical influences that contributed to the definition of the paradigm today, going through first- and second-order cybernetics, or Humberto Maturana’s work on the concept of autopoiesis and the definition of Life. The explicit goal of this paper is to present an interpretation of the enactive agenda, in context, with the hope to unveil and clarify future challenges.</p>
<p>Joel Parthemore presents an enactive interpretation of Gärdenfors’s Unified Conceptual Space Theory (2004), emphasizing the dynamical aspects that are brought forth in the interaction with the world, continuously biasing our perception. In the words of Eleanor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059712313483418">Rosch (1999)</xref>, ‘concepts are the natural bridge between mind and world to such an extent that they require us to change what we think of as mind and what we think of as world’. Studying concepts anchors the study of cognition, he argues, in the realization that concepts are only meaningful to an observer.</p>
<p>The process whereby an affordance of the world acquire some meaning for an observer is discussed by Fred Cummins, who presents an enactive interpretation of skilled action in the context of joint, or synchronous speech between two speakers. Interestingly, Cummins focuses on a wider perspective than usual, as he describes the interaction that occurs at the level of the dyad, and not just within each speaker.</p>
<p>Unlike Stephen Cowley and Luarina Nash who then presents a number of results that emphasize how embodiment, building on cultural backgrounds, contributes to the meaningful interaction with the world. Cowley and Nash describe how, constrained by linguistic, the perception–action loop can make sense of the world and contribute to problem solving.</p>
<p>Tom Froese, Alexander Woodward, and Takashi Ikegami conclude the special issue with an original contribution that bridges anthropology, physics and the interpretation of mathematical models of fluid dynamics, to explain the ubiquitousness of the geometrical visual patterns found in prehistoric art throughout the world. The argument is simple: the very particular selection of geometric patterns that is visually represented across ages and regions can be explained by neurobiological instabilities in the neural substrate shared with our conspecifics. They conclude by presenting an enactive account of sense making and value.</p>
