<body>
<p>Most people in the United States have an opinion about the topic of celebrity. For some, the opinion tends to be negative. Celebrity is viewed as a frivolous distraction from “real” issues and is often relegated to the status of “popular” culture. For the past several years, I have been studying the representation of drug use and addiction among celebrities. Celebrity gossip blogs, where stories and photos about celebrities are posted several times a day, are an interactive forum where readers can respond to these stories and each other. perezhilton.com, the most widely read gossip blog written by an individual blogger, has over 2.22 million unique viewers a month.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160597613481736">1</xref>
</sup> Perez Hilton often posts stories about celebrity drug use. One celebrity he covers quite frequently is Lindsay Lohan (she is the fourth most popular search term on his site<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160597613481736">2</xref>
</sup>). For the past three years, the majority of Perez Hilton’s coverage of Lohan has referenced drugs, addiction, and the criminal justice system. Hilton’s coverage of Lohan has prompted hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of his readers to respond. Discussions of Lohan’s legal troubles quickly turn into broader conversations about the intransigent nature of addiction and the role the criminal justice system should play in punishing repeated drug use. On Perez Hilton’s site, celebrity becomes a text through which bloggers and readers negotiate and reinvigorate the concepts “deviant” and “normal” through their discussions of celebrity (mis)behavior.</p>
<p>Take, for example, Perez Hilton’s coverage of Lindsay Lohan’s legal troubles. On three separate occasions Lohan was mandated by the courts to wear a transdermal alcohol monitoring device called a SCRAM.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160597613481736">3</xref></sup> The “secure continuous remote alcohol monitoring system,” according to its manufacturer Alcohol Monitoring Systems, is a “scientifically proven” way to ensure sobriety among people required to wear it as a condition of their sentence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160597613481736">4</xref>
</sup> The court system has been using SCRAM since 2003; over 70,000 people, many convicted of drunk driving, are currently mandated to wear the device, part of an array of “electronic tethers” in use by the criminal justice system. After Lohan was ordered in May 2010 to wear the SCRAM, Perez Hilton posted a story “Lindsanity gets slammed in Court! Slapped with SCRAM bracelet, to undergo random drug testing!”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0160597613481736">5</xref>
</sup> to which the majority of readers expressed doubt that Lohan could remain sober. The story about Lohan’s SCRAM became the basis for discussions about the nature of addiction and the surveillance of addicts. The verdict of Hilton and his readers was that prison, coerced treatment, or both, are the best way to deal with repeated drug use. These are the same approaches that characterize the U.S. “war on drugs”; 25 percent of people in jail and prison are there for drug-related offenses and the criminal justice system is the largest single source of referral to publicly funded drug treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160597613481736">Tiger 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The interactive nature of celebrity gossip blogs makes them important sites for understanding the complexity of the construction of social problems. Perez Hilton often writes words over the pictures he uses to help explain the point of his post. For example, pictures of Lohan will have the words “diseased” or “off the wagon” scrawled on them, reminding the reader that she is “sick” and that addiction is a character flaw. Readers respond to these stories, echoing this dominant perspective that addiction is a badness and a sickness. And occasionally, celebrities talk back to these stories, adding an additional layer to the interaction. When news that Lohan's SCRAM did detect alcohol use was reported on the blogs, she took to her twitter account (she has over 4.5 million followers) to explain that “Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn’t go away over night. I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0160597613481736">6</xref>
</sup> Perez Hilton immediately reported on Lohan’s twitter pronouncements; a new round of conversations took place among his readers with most of them responding to the idea that addiction is a “disease.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0160597613481736">7</xref></sup> While his readers debated this point—one wrote, “No sweetie, substance abuse is NOT a disease. CANCER is a disease” and another argued, “The American Medical Association” considers it a disease, “so I think I’ll side with the AMA on this one”—they came to a consensus that the courts need to do something for addicts, either to cure their disease or to punish their transgressions.</p>
<p>Sociologists who study celebrity argue that we work through hegemonic social values when we discuss celebrity’s significance (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160597613481736">Gamson 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597613481736">Meyers 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597613481736">Sternheimer 2011</xref>). Celebrity becomes the text through which we reaffirm dominant ideas about the “right” way to live, even if the celebrity provides us with a negative example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160597613481736">Rojek 2001</xref>). These negative examples usually come in the form of recognized social problems. Celebrity gossip blogs reiterate problems whose construction originates elsewhere—Perez Hilton and his readers did not invent the idea that regular drug use is the disease of addiction for which enforced sobriety is the cure. But Perez Hilton and his readers reinforce these ideas and negotiate with them, using celebrity as the basis to discuss broader issues related to the body and health.</p>
<p>A recent <italic>New York Times</italic> article “A Gossip Bad Boy Tries to Be Nice” explains that Perez Hilton is on a “redemption tour” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597613481736">Holson 2012</xref>). He has resolved to be nicer to celebrities because of his interest in getting “physically and mentally healthier”; he is in therapy, has lost 80 pounds, and has stopped drinking alcohol. He recently started a spin-off website called Fit Perez focused on “fitness, health and wellness + celebrities”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0160597613481736">8</xref></sup> where his stories reaffirm the importance of fitness, losing weight, not smoking, and staying sober. These articles are the “softer” edge to what Perez Hilton still excoriates on his regular site where the spectacle of celebrity drug use is highlighted for entertainment, even as the language of “health” is used to explain its significance. Celebrity gossip blogs such a Perez Hilton’s are important arenas for a critical sociological analysis; they are widely read, interactive sites where dominant cultural beliefs about the body, health, illness, and punishment are reiterated, negotiated, and reinforced.</p>
