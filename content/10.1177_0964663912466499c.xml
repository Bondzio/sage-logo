<p>In his book <italic>This Side of Silence: Human Rights, Torture, and the Recognition of Cruelty</italic>, Tobias Kelly addresses the complexities in legally recognizing and prohibiting torture. To fight against the stereotype that torture occurs in illiberal places, this book investigates the modern legal practices of defining, recognizing, monitoring, and prosecuting torture in the United Kingdom. Kelly examines how torture has been defined through judicial decisions in discrete spheres of law that are not consistent with one another in identifying torture. His key question is: what type of survivor and perpetrator does the legal category of torture allow us to recognise? This book moves beyond the familiar debate in anthropology regarding the limitations of human rights as a universal construct, to show the gap between the spirit of the law and how law is instituted in practice. The unfortunate conclusion is that even though international, regional and national bodies have legal conventions that protect individual dignity, rarely are the personal details of torture recognised in the technical processes of evaluating, measuring and calculating torture.</p>
<p>Over an introduction, six chapters and conclusion, Kelly covers two broad themes that analyse torture as a legal category: assessment and judicial recognition. Kelly interweaves these two themes throughout the book. He begins in chapter one by explaining that to understand how torture is assessed, we must first understand how the accepted definition of torture has been shaped. It is a modern definition that really took form in the 1970s, coming out of law and medicine. Amnesty International spearheaded the campaign against torture as an act that was universally recognisable. This campaign mobilised transnational advocacy networks that went beyond lobbying states and politicians to appealing to general citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912466499c">Keck and Sikkink, 1998</xref>). Victims were framed as heroic, while medical experts pathologised torture. In 1975, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution-condemning torture. The United Kingdom made torture a criminal offense in 1984.</p>
<p>Torture was legally prohibited; however, the established definition of torture was left vague and the processes meant to assess it leave much room for interpretation within the courtroom. For example, the crux of an asylum case is that the asylum seeker suffered and should be protected from future harm. Asylum cases are civil cases, but as Kelly demonstrates in chapter two, the standards of proof differ in ways that keep torture from being an easily recognisable experience. Typically, in civil cases, the judge rules on what evidence can be presented. Thus, if evidence is presented, its factuality is not questioned unless by counter evidence. In asylum cases, the rules of evidence are not as strict and every fact that is presented is called into question. This is particularly true of medicolegal reports. In his second chapter, Kelly demonstrates the difference between a clinical diagnosis and legal proof. He reveals the tension between medical and legal objectivity. Clinicians approach diagnosis as incomplete and subject to revision, whereas lawyers seek definitive assertions of facts. The medicolegal reports force clinicians to move between ‘medical and legal modes of causation’ by fitting the patient’s complex, subjective experience into sequelae set by impartial standards that are recognised by legal actors. Kelly describes this as a clash of epistomologies, ‘[l]egal regimes face different ways of knowing, built on different methodological assumptions, theoretical foundations, and political commitments…’ (p. 15). Through the Istanbul Protocol scale, clinicians try to adapt to the rigid legal categories by merging the technical with their commitments of compassion to their patients’ traumatic-lived experiences. Nevertheless, it is assessed by the judges on different parameters of objectivity and is treated like all the evidence presented – approached with doubt.</p>
<p>As much as doctors attempt to maintain the asylum seeker’s experience in the medicolegal reports, Kelly demonstrates that asylum cases rarely focus on the individual. He documents an appeal hearing during which the plaintiff did not even get to speak and the evidence was scrutinised for consistency rather than taken as an individual’s life story (p. 58–65). The final chapter argues that the procedures for monitoring torture also obscure individual action and experience. It demonstrates how transnational and regional monitoring organisations use measurement and assessment techniques to identify statistical trends, which thus abstract and generalise abuses. The particulars of context, history and actors are stripped from such reports in order to project an unambiguous likeliness of torture that must be prevented. By analyzing these assessment techniques, Kelly substantiates one of his main arguments. The technical processes for assessing if torture occurred, attempt to measure something that is immeasurable, human suffering and pain.</p>
<p>It would, however, be a mistake to discount the underlying political intentions of judicial recognition of torture. Kelly demonstrates this in a more subtle way through analyzing different types of court cases, asylum cases in chapter one, future risk in deportation cases in chapter four and prosecution cases in chapter five. Comparing civil cases to criminal cases may seem like comparing apples and oranges, yet Kelly’s analysis reveals that the different procedures in these cases contribute to the overall shortfall in combating torture. For instance, in prosecution cases the standards of proof are stricter than asylum cases, and thus the facticity of evidence presented is not perpetually unstable. Rather, the way the torture cases are prosecuted very much depend on which laws apply and provide the best chance for successful prosecution. The UK courts were limited to the charges of torture and hostage-taking in the case against the Afghani commander, Zardad. Under the Geneva Convention Act, UK courts cannot extradite foreign officials for anything less than torture. In the case of the British Army in Basra, the courts had more leeway on what charges they could use to prosecute the soldier, Paine, and his superior, Mendonca. Torture was an available charge, but rather, the court chose the lesser charges of inhuman treatment, assault and negligence. This prosecutorial strategy was taken to assure conviction. Therefore, what may have seemed like similar acts were being prosecuted differently by UK courts. What differed in these cases were the men’s nationalities and the wartime situations. The legal distinction between torture and inhuman treatment is one of the intents. In Zardad’s case, the prosecution had to prove that he purposely caused cruel and unusual punishment. The case became a ‘violent man in a lawless place’ (p. 140). The case against the Paine and Mendonca, on the other hand, focused on the degree to which they deviated from official protocol; right and wrong were not presented for judicial consideration. The central argument of this chapter is that the ways in which torture is criminalised and prosecuted under English law are inconsistent depending on jurisdiction, war and nationality of the defendant. Attributing culpability is an uneven process that seemingly eschews politics for the law, but is informed by geopolitical hierarchy and has political implications nonetheless.</p>
<p>The other form of judicial recognition that Kelly analyses in chapter four is the future risk of torture in deportation cases. Similar to the realm of finance, risk is seen as ‘taming the future’ (p. 101); however, it is not seen as assessing uncertainty and trying to control it in positive terms. Rather, the future is seen in negative terms, how the British state can avoid complicity in future harm rather than stopping it. Judicial assessment of risk, Kelly claims, is framed by considering the likelihood of a narrow set of wrongs that may occur rather than considering the greater good (p. 118). Kelly asserts that judges do this through prognosis. Like diviners judges assess the future as a ‘domain of finite possibilities’ that are based on particular considerations and perspectives from the past and present (p. 114). Judges’ ability to assess future risk of torture is influenced by a juridical sensibility that favours the patterns and predictability of law. Nevertheless, the sources favoured by judges provide insight into the political aspects of recognizing torture. Judges tend to prioritise diplomatic expertise rather than scholarly expertise. Diplomats give assurances by emphasizing the democratic intents of the countries in question, whereas scholars provide more critical, complex views of the track record of countries in doubt, which focus on the gap between intentionality and actuality. Judges need to assert certainty in order to resolve the question of future risk. ‘The assessment of future risk of torture produces a picture of politics as formal, pragmatic, and transparent, which puts to one side the possibility of temporal conflicts, breaks, and countercurrents’ (p. 117). The unfortunate reality is if the judge is mistaken, the only recourse is a fresh claim – a claim that will be considered not in a deportation case, either as an asylum case or a prosecution case, which have different shortcomings in securing against torture.</p>
<p>In their critical overview article on anthropological literature on human rights <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912466499c">Jean-Klein and Riles (2005)</xref> challenge us to consider not how anthropology can offer something relevant to the issue of human rights, but how human rights can extend anthropological knowledge in new directions. Kelly’s book succeeds in doing this by demonstrating that legal recognition of torture creates ‘broad spaces of unknowability between the general and the specific, the principle and the practice’ (p. 118). This book reveals the logic that underpins the sociohistorical context of torture as a legal category, and how this logic affects and is affected by technical processes. Taken as a whole, his analysis demonstrates how we have yet to accomplish protection against torture because the inability to recognise it is through the expert knowledge practices that were set to combat it.</p>
<p>I recommend this book for the classroom, particularly courses that are topically focused on human rights, law and society as well as legal anthropology. It is a productive read for both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The theoretical arguments emerge out of the case studies making them comprehensive and accessible. It nicely demonstrates the social role of law, particularly the interplay between the sociohistorical processes that inform legislation and how legal and juridical practices shape public attitudes of what counts as human rights violations. Kelly pushes the reader to consider how laws and the way they are practiced provide insight into our view of ourselves and others. The uneven way by which the torture is recognised, prosecuted and monitored allows the United Kingdom to maintain boundaries on who and what is civilised. This book shows how degrees of complicity become necessary to maintain these boundaries despite the universal prohibition against torture.</p>
