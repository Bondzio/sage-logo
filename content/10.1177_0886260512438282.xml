<abstract>
<p>Femicide, the murder of females (most often at the hands of males), is an understudied area in homicide research. Furthermore, femicide perpetrated by females has been all but ignored. One reason this may be is because of the rarity of homicide victimization perpetrated by females. Rather, most homicide incidents consist of a male offender and a male victim. When a homicide does involve a female, either as a victim or as an offender, the other party implicated is generally a male. The primary goal of the proposed study is to provide an in-depth, albeit exploratory, examination of female-perpetrated femicide. Using homicide data taken from the Dallas Homicide Unit, 403 cases of femicide will be analyzed, with special attention devoted to comparing female-perpetrated femicide incidents (<italic>n</italic> = 39) against male-perpetrated femicide incidents (<italic>n</italic> = 364). Specifically, the current study will explore the similarities and differences in sociodemographic characteristics of victims and suspects, offense characteristics, and offense circumstances. Contrary to what was expected, results, at first glance, seem to suggest an overwhelming similarity between femicide suspects and victims, irrespective of gender. However, when the relationship between victim and suspect is considered, distinct differences appear. Implications from these findings as well as limitations and suggestions for further research are discussed.</p>

<title>Femicide Victimization</title>
<p>Within the body of literature that labels the killing of women as femicide, the majority of studies have been devoted to the discussion of male-perpetrated femicide (Aziz-Baumgartner, McKeown, Melvin, Dang, &amp; Reed, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438282">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438282">Dawson &amp; Gartner, 1998</xref>; Dixon &amp; Browne, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye, Hosein, Waltermaurer, Blaney, &amp; Wilt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438282">Frye &amp; Wilt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438282">Glass, Laughon, Rutto, Bevacqua, &amp; Campbell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512438282">McFarlane et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438282">Smith, Moracco, &amp; Butts, 1998</xref>). As such, research that has focused on the characteristics of female-perpetrated femicide is rare, but a few studies have provided information regarding the distinguishing characteristics of various forms of femicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438282">Glass, Koziol-McLain, Campbell, &amp; Block, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>). Together, this body of knowledge suggests that femicide is a phenomenon with several distinctive victim, offender, and event characteristics.</p>

<title>Victim–Offender Relationship</title>
<p>Historically, research on female homicide victimization has primarily focused on intimate partner femicide perpetrated by men (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438282">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438282">Dawson &amp; Gartner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438282">Smith et al., 1998</xref>). Intimate partner killings do account for a significant portion of femicide cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>); however, female homicide victimization also occurs outside the context of an intimate relationship. In one study, acquaintance and familial killings constituted 63.8% of all nonintimate femicides committed in North Carolina between 1991 and 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>). Taken together, intimate partner, acquaintance, and familial femicides accounted for the vast majority (81.9%) of femicides in North Carolina. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al.’s (1998)</xref> findings suggest that, even outside the intimate partner context, femicide rarely occurs between strangers as most femicide victims know their killer.</p>

<sec id="section3-0886260512438282">
<title>Victim–Offender Characteristics</title>
<p>Across studies, femicide victims appear to vary in age, race, educational attainment, and employment status. Some research suggests that femicide victims are primarily young women in their 20s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512438282">Azziz-Baumgartner, McKeown, Melvin, Dang, &amp; Reed, 2011</xref>) to mid-30s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438282">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512438282">McFarlane et al., 1999</xref>). Other research suggests differential rates of female homicide victimization at various stages of the life course, with higher rates for women under 35 and above 65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>). The ages of femicide victims also appear to vary across victim–offender relationship categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438282">Dawson &amp; Gartner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>). According to the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos’ (1999)</xref> analysis of Australian femicides, victims of intimate partner femicides tend to be younger than those victims killed by family members or strangers. Their analysis revealed that victims in marital relationships were significantly older than those in common-law and dating relationships. Finally, victims’ age appears to vary by race, with White victims being older than minority victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512438282">Azziz-Baumgartner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Femicide, like homicide more generally, is an overwhelmingly intraracial event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438282">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512438282">Morton, Runyan, Moracco, &amp; Butts, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438282">Smith et al., 1998</xref>). Female homicide victimization disproportionately affects minority women, with research indicating that racial minorities are often overrepresented as femicide victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512438282">Azziz-Baumgartner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438282">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512438282">Taylor &amp; Nabors, 2009</xref>). In addition, it has been suggested that a victim’s race may be related to the type of femicide to which she falls victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>). For instance, one study found that stranger killings were significantly more common among White women than Black women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye and her colleagues (2005)</xref> also found racial differences among femicide types. Specifically, the researchers discovered that Asian women were far more likely to fall victim to intimate partner homicide, whereas Black women were more likely to be murdered by a nonintimate offender. While Black women may be less likely to be killed at the hands of an intimate than a nonintimate, Black women are disproportionately represented among victims of intimate partner femicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512438282">Azziz-Baumgartner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438282">Glass et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512438282">McFarlane et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438282">Smith et al., 1998</xref>). Put simply, minority women are at significantly greater risk of female homicide victimization than their White counterparts, overall.</p>
<p>Rates of femicide victimization appear to vary by education levels and employment status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438282">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438282">Dawson &amp; Gartner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438282">Frye &amp; Wilt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438282">Glass et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512438282">Morton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438282">Smith et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512438282">Taylor &amp; Nabors, 2009</xref>). Generally speaking, employment and higher levels of education are associated with lower rates of femicide victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438282">Frye &amp; Wilt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438282">Glass et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512438282">Morton et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>). It should be noted, however, that a few studies have found contradictory results. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438282">Campbell and colleagues (2003)</xref> found that women in the workforce accounted for 65.9% of intimate partner femicide victims (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512438282">McFarlane et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Research indicates that femicide victims and offenders often share similar educational backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512438282">Morton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>); however, recent intimate partner femicide research suggests that femicide victimization risk may vary according to certain educational disparities between victims and their killers. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512438282">Taylor and Nabors (2009)</xref> discovered that women with higher levels of education than their intimates were almost 10 times more likely to become victims of intimate partner femicide than women with lower or similar levels of education as their partners. Despite the variety of findings, overall, the literature indicates that lower levels of employment and education are risk factors for femicide victimization and perpetration.</p>

<sec id="section4-0886260512438282">
<title>Event Characteristics</title>
<p>As indicated in the literature, femicides often occur in private dwellings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>) although some women are at higher risk of victimization in the home than others. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco and her colleagues (1998)</xref> found that women above the age of 55 were more than five times as likely to be murdered in their homes than younger women. An intimate relationship between the victim and her killer also greatly increases the likelihood of femicide occurring at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438282">Smith et al., 1998</xref>). To illustrate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos’ (1999)</xref> findings suggest that homicide victimization in the home is the most significant factor associated with intimate partner femicide. Similarly, 80% of the intimate partner femicides studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438282">Dawson and Gartner (1998)</xref> occurred in private dwellings.</p>
<p>The method of murder appears to vary slightly in the literature. In terms of gun usage, a number of studies suggest that firearms are used in more than half of femicide cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438282">Glass et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438282">Smith et al., 1998</xref>), while others suggest that guns are involved less frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>). Similarly, the percentage of victims killed by knives and other stabbing weapons varies between 12% and 32% across some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438282">Smith et al., 1998</xref>). As with event location, weapon choice fluctuates dependent on victim–offender characteristics. To illustrate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al.’s (1998)</xref> analysis revealed that method varied with victim age. Women under 55 were more than twice more likely to be killed with a firearm than older women. In contrast, women above 55 were more likely to be beaten to death.</p>
<p>In addition to age, some research suggests that firearm involvement is especially common in femicides where the victim and offender share an intimate relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438282">Dawson &amp; Gartner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438282">Glass et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512438282">Morton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438282">Smith et al., 1998</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512438282">Morton and her colleagues’ (1998)</xref> analysis of intimate partner murder–suicides in North Carolina between 1988 and 1992 revealed that 96% of the cases of successful murder–suicides involved the use of firearms. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos (1999)</xref> found that stabbings were the most common method of female homicide victimization when committed in the context of an intimate partner relationship.</p>
<p>Substance abuse, especially among femicide perpetrators, plays a role in the lethal victimization of women. For instance, 60% of the offenders from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438282">Glass and her colleagues’ (2004)</xref> study of female-perpetrated intimate partner homicides were reported to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the day of the murder. In contrast, 40% of victims appeared to have histories of substance abuse. These findings are supported by other research that indicates a higher incidence of substance abuse among femicide offenders than victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512438282">Morton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438282">Smith et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize, femicide appears to be a complex phenomenon, the circumstances of which vary across a number of key victim and offender characteristics. Overall, the literature reveals that femicide victims and their killers typically know one another, are of the same race, are undereducated and underemployed, and often live together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>). However, because femicide research has generally disregarded the role that women play as perpetrators of femicide, the similarities or differences between femicidal acts committed by men and women have yet to be examined in depth. What little is known suggests that female-perpetrated femicides are significantly different from femicides committed by men, at least with regard to the relationships between victims and offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886260512438282">
<title>Female-Perpetrated Femicide</title>
<p>As noted previously, femicide researchers have overwhelmingly ignored female-perpetrated killings in their analyses. Of the few studies that include data on female offenders, the characteristics of female-perpetrated femicidal acts are given little more than passing mention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>; for an exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438282">Glass et al., 2004</xref>). The same appears to be true of research on female homicide perpetration. With few exceptions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438282">Goetting, 1988b</xref>), the potentially unique characteristics of female-perpetrated killings of women are lost in the aggregate analyses of female homicide offending more generally. Despite the paucity of research devoted to the killing of women by other women, the literature does provide a foundation from which to approach the study of female-perpetrated femicide.</p>
<p>Drawing from the aforementioned literature, the typical female homicide offender is an undereducated and unemployed minority (however, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512438282">Jurik &amp; Winn, 1990</xref>) between 25 and 44 years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438282">Goetting, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512438282">1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512438282">Mann, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512438282">McClain, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512438282">Shipley &amp; Arrigo, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260512438282">Wilbanks, 1983</xref>).

<p>In her examination of 15 acts of female-on-female homicide in Detroit between 1982 and 1983, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438282">Goetting (1988b)</xref> observed a number of differences between the characteristics of female-perpetrated murders of men and women. Whereas evidence suggested victim precipitation in 56% of the incidents in the greater sample from which these cases originated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438282">Goetting, 1988a</xref>), only 20% of the female homicide victimizations appeared to be victim precipitated. The researcher posited that victim precipitation occurred far less frequently because of the number of victims who were children. In fact, while the average age of victims in the greater study was around 36 years, the average age of female victims was just above 21 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438282">Goetting, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512438282">1988b</xref>). Despite these differences, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438282">Goetting (1988b)</xref> concluded that, with the notable exception that the typical victim is a child, the women who killed women in Detroit were no different from the women who killed men. In contrast, others have argued that the typical female-on-female killing was committed against an acquaintance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512438282">Shipley &amp; Arrigo, 2004b</xref>). Notwithstanding the differences in victim and event characteristics across studies, female homicide offenders appear to share many characteristics, irrespective of the gender of their victims.</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>As highlighted above much of the research attention has been devoted to the study of femicide within the confines of intimate heterosexual relationships. The current exploratory study expands on previous research by providing an in-depth examination of male- and female-perpetrated femicides in the urban South. Specifically, this study will examine female homicide victimizations that occurred within the city of Dallas, Texas over a 17-year time frame (1981-1997). While doing so, we will explore three specific comparisons between male and female femicide suspects: victim demographic characteristics, suspect demographic characteristics, and contextual factors of the incident. Based on the research literature, three hypotheses were developed. First, we expect that female homicide victims who are killed by female suspects will differ significantly from female homicide victims who are killed by male suspects. In our second hypothesis, we propose that femicide suspect characteristics will also differ significantly by gender. Finally, we predict that the homicide incident will be contextually different for femicide victims dependent on femicide suspect gender. Because of the limited research in this area, it is difficult to predict exactly what those differences will be. Therefore, all three hypotheses remain exploratory or nondirectional hypotheses.</p>

<title>Dallas Homicide Data Set</title>
<p>Electronic homicide investigation files that were created and maintained by the Dallas Police Department’s (DPD) Homicide Unit were the primary source of data for the present study. As part of a larger research project aimed at exploring homicide in Dallas, data were collected on all homicide incidents reported to the DPD over a 17-year period (January 1981 through December 1997). The initial data set included 4,508 homicide incidents reported to the DPD, which contained information about the incident (i.e., primary cause of death, motive, victim–suspect relationship, location where homicide occurred, and time of day, day of week, and month in which homicide occurred), victim(s) (i.e., age at time of death, gender, race, alcohol/drug use at time of death, criminal history, and probation/parole status), suspects(s) (i.e., age at time of offense, gender, race, alcohol/drug use at time of death, criminal history, and probation/parole status), and case status (i.e., case cleared by arrest).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260512438282">
<title>Female Homicide Victimization Data set</title>
<p>Of the 4,508 homicide incidents occurring within the city of Dallas between 1981 and 1997, 460 homicides (10.2%) were identified as involving female homicide victims. Further examination revealed that in 57 cases there were either multiple homicide victims and/or multiple homicide suspects. These cases were excluded and, as such, the sample includes only incidents where there was one female homicide victim and one suspect (female or male; <italic>N</italic> = 403).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886260512438282">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>For this study, two sets of variables were taken from the DPD’s Homicide Unit’s electronic files. The first set of variables reflected the demographic characteristics of the victim and the suspect involved in each homicide incident, including age (years), gender (male, female), race (Asian, Black, Hispanic, or White), and criminal history (yes, no).</p>
<p>The second set of variables included descriptions of the homicide incident such as alcohol and drug use at time of incident (yes, no), location (private residence, business, other), relationship between victim and suspect (acquaintance, familial, intimate, stranger, or unknown), suspect motive (accident, criminal, dispute, sexual, or other), primary method by which victim was killed (firearm, knife, blunt force trauma, or asphyxiation), and whether or not the homicidal incident ended with the suspect committing suicide (yes, no).</p>
<p>When victim, suspect, and offense characteristics are examined, a fairly stable pattern emerges. On average, femicide victims were in their early 30s (<italic>M</italic> = 32.4 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 17.413; range 0-94 years of age) and of minority status (55.3% were Black, 14.9% were Hispanic, and 2.0% were Asian). Very few of the victims had a criminal history (8.7%). The majority of victims (75.4%) had some type of relationship (acquaintance, intimate, or familial) with their murderer. Less than one quarter of victims were involved with drugs (19.1%) or alcohol (24.6%) during the time of the homicide incident. The largest percentages of femicides appeared to stem from a dispute or altercation (62.7%), or were committed during the commission of another crime (17.1%). The primary method of death was by a firearm (61.0%). The majority of femicide cases occurred at a private residence (66.0%).</p>
<p>It is important to point out that femicides that occurred in the city of Dallas appear to be somewhat unique when compared to state and national data for the same time period (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512438282">Table 1</xref>). In particular, female homicide victims in the city of Dallas were more likely to be Black (55.3% vs. 30.6% of Texas femicide victims and 37.1% of U.S. femicide victims). Similarly, femicide suspects in Dallas were more likely to be Black (60.0% compared to 34.6% of femicide suspects in Texas and 42.0% of femicide suspects in the United States.) compared to their state and national counterparts. Female homicide victims in Dallas were also twice as likely to be killed by a stranger (15.9% vs. 7.8% of Texas femicide victims and 8.3% of U.S. femicide victims) and three times as likely to die from blunt force trauma (12.7% vs. 4.9% of femicide victims in Texas and 5.9% of femicide victims in the United States) than their female counterparts in Texas or the United States.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Differences in factors associated with femicide were examined. Independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests and chi-square statistics were used to test statistical significance. To control for the increased Type I error associated with running multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni correction, which adjusts alpha levels based on the number of comparisons being made, is used to adjust reported significance levels.

<p>On the whole, femicide victims were predominately non-White (84.6% of FPF victims and 70.9% of MPF victims). Femicide victims were also unlikely to have a criminal history (only 12.8% of FPF victims and 8.2% of MPF victims had an officially recorded criminal incident). No statistically significant differences were found related to age. MPF victims were generally in their early 30s (<italic>M</italic> = 32.9 years) while FPF victims were in their late 20s (<italic>M</italic> = 27.6 years).</p>
<p>Similar to the results examining victim characteristics by suspect gender, no statistically significant differences were found between female and male perpetrated femicide suspects. Like their victims, the majority of femicide suspects were of minority status (79.5% of FPF suspects and 75.6% of MPF suspects), had clean criminal records (only 15.4% of FPF suspects and 16.5% of MPF suspects had an officially recorded criminal incident), and were relatively young (median age for male suspects was 32.0 years and the median age for female suspects was 26.6 years).</p>
<p>An interesting pattern emerged when the relationship between the suspect and victim was examined. FPF suspects were more likely to be an acquaintance of the victim (46.2%) than were MPF suspects (25.0%). MPF suspects, on the other hand, were more likely to have an intimate relationship with their victim (37.4% compared with 23.1% of FPF suspects), or not know their victim (17.3%) than were FPF suspects (2.6%). These results were statistically significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 10.972, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .007).</p>

<p>In terms of alcohol and drug use, no statistically significant differences were found across victims and suspects, regardless of suspect gender. Similar and relatively small proportions of each group were recorded as having used alcohol (less than 30%) and/or drugs (less than 20%) prior to the femicide incident.</p>
<p>Motive, as indicated in the police report, was also examined. Female perpetrated femicides were significantly more likely to involve a dispute (70.3% of FPFs compared with 61.8% of MPFs) or family violence (21.6% of FPFs compared with 6.5% of MPFs). On the other hand, male perpetrated femicides were significantly more likely to be crime related (18.3% of MPFs compared with 5.4% of FPFs), or sexual (11.2% of MPFs compared with 0% of FPFs). These differences were statistically significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 17.393, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .006).</p>
<p>During the time period studied, most femicide victims were killed with a firearm; 63.2% of FPF incidents and 60.8% of MPF incidents. While homicide/suicide incidents were relatively rare in the total sample (25 cases representing only 6.2% of all femicide incidents), all of these cases involved a male suspect. Further analysis revealed that these cases were mostly likely to involve a homicide stemming from a dispute (80% compared to 62.7% of nonfemicide/suicides; χ<sup>2</sup> = 14.425, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and where the victim and suspect were, or had been, in an intimate relationship (84% compared to 32.8% of all nonhomicide/suicides; χ<sup>2</sup> = 27.082, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The majority of femicide/suicides also involved older victims (<italic>M</italic> = 42.08, <italic>SD</italic> = 23.112) and suspects (<italic>M</italic> = 43.25, <italic>SD</italic> = 20.42) than nonfemicide/suicide victims (<italic>M</italic> = 31.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 16.808, <italic>t</italic> = 9.608, <italic>p</italic> = &lt; .01) and suspects (<italic>M</italic> = 30.72, <italic>SD</italic> = 16.803, <italic>t</italic> = 16.633, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Finally, 95.8% of femicide/suicides were committed with firearms compared to 58.8% of femicides not involving the suicide of the suspect (χ<sup>2</sup> = 13.515, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>Finally, case status was examined. The majority of cases (92.6%) were cleared by the Dallas Police Department for femicides occurring between 1981 and 1997, with no statistically significant differences found between cases involving male suspects (92.9%) or female suspects (89.7%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the current exploratory study was to examine potential differences between female- and male-perpetrated femicides. Existing research has highlighted a number of characteristics unique to intimate partner femicide; however, to our knowledge, no studies exist comparing female homicide victimization by offender gender. What little literature exists on FPF suggests that risk factors for intimate partner femicide are similar across offender gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438282">Glass et al., 2004</xref>), but not much is known about how femicide, as a whole, is similar or dissimilar across offender gender. To explore this question, we examined all single suspect–single victim femicides occurring in Dallas, Texas between 1981 and 1997. Again, we hypothesized that marked differences between victim, suspect, and contextual circumstances would exist among male- and female-perpetrated femicide.</p>
<p>Contrary to what was expected, the results, at first glance, seem to suggest more similarities than differences between femicide suspect and victims, irrespective of suspect gender. Similar to previous femicide research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>), the demographic profiles of female victims and their killers are remarkably similar in terms of race, age, and criminal history, regardless of suspect gender. Furthermore, for the most part contextual differences related to the femicidal incident (i.e., victim and suspect substance use, location, method, and case status) were not found. There were, however, a few telling differences discovered that indicate that suspect gender is an important consideration in the study of female homicide victimization.</p>
<p>The first, and most profound, difference had to do with the relationship between the femicide victim and suspect. In cases of female-perpetrated femicide, the victim and suspect were more likely to know one another (as an acquaintance, family member, or intimate partner) than in cases of male-perpetrated femicide. Our finding that almost half of FPF cases involved acquaintances was also similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512438282">Hirschinger and colleagues’ (2003)</xref> study of female on female violence, which reported that 56% of victims reported being acquaintances or neighbors of their assailants. Similarly, in her study of Black female homicide offenders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512438282">McClain (1981)</xref> found that 33.3% of offenders had murdered acquaintances although she argued that many of those murders were motivated by a dispute involving a male intimate. Careful analysis of the police narrative in cases of acquaintance FPF in our study revealed that a substantial number of these acts took place in a bar or party setting. A smaller proportion was related to retaliation or an argument pertaining to a third party (i.e., “fighting over a man that both of them were dating”). It should be noted, however, that the majority of acquaintance FPF police narratives were rather brief (i.e., “suspect shot complainant during an argument”) making it impossible to determine any further underlying motives for the femicidal act.</p>
<p>Stranger femicides comprise a relatively small (15.9%) but unique category of femicide that is also dependent on the gender of the suspect. Male-perpetrated homicides were almost seven times as likely to involve a suspect unknown to the victim (stranger femicides) than were female-perpetrated femicides. Further analysis revealed that of the 63 cases of stranger MPF, nearly equal parts were crime related (i.e., drug or gang related) or sexually motivated. In comparison, there was only one case of stranger FPF. According to the police narrative for this case, the female victim was shot during the commission of a home burglary by the female suspect making the incident crime related. Interestingly, this case seems to be somewhat of an anomaly considering female property offenders operating independently are relatively rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512438282">Fortune, Vega, &amp; Silverman, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Important differences were also detected related to motive. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512438282">McLain’s (1981)</xref> female homicide study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco and colleagues’ (1998)</xref> discussion of nonintimate partner femicides, the majority of cases in our study were dispute-oriented. This was the case, regardless of suspect gender. One major distinguishing factor between male- and female-perpetrated femicides was found regarding criminal involvement. Male suspects were almost 3.5 times more likely than females to have committed a femicide that was connected to the commission of another crime (e.g., burglary, robbery, and/or sexual assault). This finding may be an artifact of the research design employed in the current study. The exclusion of multiple victims and multiple suspects may have reduced the number of crime-related femicides, especially for FPF as research indicates that when women are criminally involved in general, their contribution is often as an accessory to a male partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512438282">Alarid, Marquart, Burton, Cullen, &amp; Cuvelier, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Femicides that involved the subsequent suicide of the suspect were found to be unique to male-perpetrated femicide only. In all 25 cases of femicide/suicide, the suspect was male and 10 years older than male femicide suspect in general. Similar to research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512438282">Morton et al. (1998)</xref>, the majority of femicide/suicides involved the killing of an older than average intimate partner with a firearm following a dispute. Although research has demonstrated that suicide threats often precede female-perpetrated intimate partner femicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438282">Glass et al., 2004</xref>), the data here suggest that women who kill their female intimates are not at risk of suicide. This finding may be indicative of gender differences in the experience and expression of emotion or patterns of abuse between males and females.</p>
<p>Somewhat unexpected, differences in weaponry were not found. This finding seems, at first glance, counterintuitive as one might expect that female offenders, as compared to males, would be more likely to capitalize on the equalizing power of firearms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512438282">Mann, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512438282">Shipley &amp; Arrigo, 2004b</xref>). In fact, 63.2% of female suspects and 60.8% of male suspects used firearms in the femicide incident at hand. Female homicide offenders’ use of firearms is well documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512438282">Johnson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512438282">Jurik &amp; Winn, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512438282">Mann, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512438282">Shipley &amp; Arrigo, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260512438282">Weisheit, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260512438282">Wilbanks, 1983</xref>), and other femicide studies have reported similar incidence of firearm usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Some femicide research has revealed an interesting connection between victim–offender age and relationship, with a number of findings suggesting that victims and perpetrators of intimate partner femicide are younger than those of other femicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>). This study found similar results. When the relationship between victim and suspect was taken into consideration, age affects appeared (when victim–suspect relationship is not factored in, there are no statistically significant differences in age, again highlighting the utility of taking into consideration the femicidal context). In domestic relationships involving FPF, the average age of the victim was 12.4 years compared to the average MPF victim age of 30.71 years (<italic>t</italic> = 2.437, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Careful analyses of police narratives reveal that in the majority of these cases, domestic relationships involve a familial relationship generally between a mother (offender) and a child (victim). These findings were consistent with previous research indicating that when women kill their offspring, they are most likely to kill younger rather than older children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512438282">Boudreaux &amp; Lord, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512438282">Palermo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438282">Porter &amp; Gavin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The dominating theme in this study appeared to be that suspect gender matters most within the context of the victim–offender relationship. This coincides with the general body of homicide literature, which has found that the interaction between victim–offender relationship and various demographic and contextual variables is an important consideration in explaining homicides (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512438282">Decker, 1996</xref>). We would argue the same holds true for the study of femicide. Overall, male- and female-perpetrated femicides appear to be remarkably similar, until victim–offender relationship is considered. When relationship is assessed, distinct differences between female and male-perpetrated femicide appear. This represents a first step in the study of female-perpetrated femicide; therefore, existing support for these findings is largely unavailable within the femicide literature. Nonetheless, there are dissimilarities in the contextual and event characteristics between the male- and female-perpetrated femicides examined here (including age, motive, and femicide/suicide) that indicate that offender gender is salient to the study of femicide, especially when victim–offender relationship is taken into consideration.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>While this study has provided insight into the similarities and differences between the characteristics of female- and male-perpetrated femicides and the overall influence of victim–offender relationship, there are a number of limitations that should be noted. First, the reliance on official data in and of itself is problematic. Limitations associated with reliance on official data, including inaccuracy, underreporting, and missing information, have been well documented elsewhere (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438282">Mosher, Miethe, &amp; Phillips, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512438282">Reidel, 1999</xref>). These limitations, however, are generally counterbalanced by the breadth and depth of information obtained in police homicide records, compared to other types of homicide data available (i.e., mortality data and court records).</p>
<p>Case in point, the data set used for this study is unique in that it essentially provides a multifarious case study of the homicide problem in one major urban area in the South. There are few such data sets known to be in existence, most of which focus on homicide in the Northeastern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512438282">Cheatwood &amp; Block, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438282">Pizarro &amp; McGloin, 2006</xref>; Sobol, 1997) or Midwestern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438282">Block &amp; Christakos, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512438282">Watkins &amp; Decker, 2007</xref>) sections of the nation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438282">Brewer &amp; Paulsen, 1999</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438282">Martinez, 2003</xref> for data sets from Southern cities). Similarly, when femicide has been studied, analyses have largely focused on male-perpetrated femicides (Aziz-Baumgartner et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438282">Dawson &amp; Gartner, 1998</xref>; Dixon &amp; Browne, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438282">Frye &amp; Wilt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438282">Glass et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512438282">McFarlane et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438282">Smith et al., 1998</xref>) occurring in the Northeast (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438282">Brewer &amp; Paulsen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438282">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref> for femicide studies including Southern cities). Although a number of these studies have used large, multifaceted data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438282">Dawson &amp; Gartner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438282">Frye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438282">Moracco et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438282">Mouzos, 1999</xref>), cases of female-perpetrated femicide are either excluded from analysis or are only passively mentioned. As such, this article adds to the current homicide literature not only through its examination of sex-specific variation in femicide offending but also through its description of femicide in the urban South. Furthermore, our study suggests that homicides involving female victims in the city of Dallas were contextually different during the time period studied than elsewhere in the state and nation. Such differences point to the importance of conducting homicide studies at the city level.</p>
<p>That being said, we would be remiss to ignore the fact that the data set used for the current study is plagued by several missing variables that may better elucidate the differences between male and female-perpetrated femicide, including key demographic characteristics (i.e., education, employment status, socioeconomic status), case outcomes (i.e., which suspects were guilty), and victimization histories. Research has found that female criminal involvement, as victims and offenders, is likely to follow a history of abuse (physical and sexual) at the hands of family members as a child and by intimate partners as an adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512438282">McClain 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512438282">1982</xref>). In-depth interviews with femicide offenders, family members of the victims, and eye witnesses to the homicidal act would help to triangulate the potential differences in femicide by offender gender.</p>
<p>The current study also suffers from a relatively small sample size. Although the numbers of female femicide perpetrators have increased over the past two decades, the overall base rate remains moderately low. As such, collecting large samples is somewhat difficult, even in larger metropolitan areas like Dallas. Another difficulty faced with a small sample size relates to the sensitivity of statistical analyses and the types of analyses that can be performed.</p>
<p>As an exploratory look at female-perpetrated femicide in the urban South, the overall sample may not be generalizable to other female-perpetrated femicides. The racial composition of this sample is unique in that it is predominately non-White (less than one quarter of victims and offenders were White). Thus, although the issue of generalizability of the findings perhaps is raised by the current sample (mostly Non-Whites from the South), the current study adds to the limited existing literature exploring femicide homicide victim and offender characteristics in a population that has previously been unstudied. Data from several geographic regions should also be collected and analyzed for any potentially significant characteristic variance. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438282">Campbell et al.’s (2003)</xref> study used data from 10 cities, the researchers did not elucidate whether or not the characteristics of femicidies from each city were similar or dissimilar.</p>
<p>Finally, future studies should expand the current focus to include cases with multiple victims. Careful analysis of the data set revealed that in cases of multiple victims and/or suspects, the majority of variables (particularly related to the homicidal incident) were missing. As such, any meaningful comparison between female and male perpetrated femicide looking at single compared to multiple victims and/or suspects would be difficult. Subsequently, cases involving multiple victims/and or suspects were excluded from the current study. This is unfortunate and a limitation of the current study as research has indicated that males are more likely than females to kill more than one individual, a potential key difference between the samples of interest. As such, multiple-victim femicides may vary dramatically from single-victim femicides, both in terms of context and victim–offender characteristics. Multiple-victim events may be indicative of a markedly different social context (i.e., drug or gang related) from the single-victim events studied here. Researchers have identified that the presence and participation of witnesses is common to female-female violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512438282">Hirschinger et al., 2003</xref>); however, it is unknown whether multiple-victim femicides are similar or dissimilar to these nonlethal cases. The effect of offender gender on these contextual factors is also an important variable for future study.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512438282">Peterson (1999)</xref>, in her work on female-perpetrated intimate homicide argues that “understanding the conditions that explain why women commit far fewer homicides could provide insight into why men commit far more” (p. 30). We believe the same argument applies to the study of femicide. Are female-perpetrated acts of femicide contextually similar to male-perpetrated acts of femicide? Our exploratory study suggests that FPF is, in fact, different than MPF. Factors such as age, victim–offender relationship, and motive and their interaction with the gender of the offender profoundly influence the femicidal act. Further research, however, is needed before definitive conclusions can be made. Future studies need to account for offender gender within the context of femicide making it possible to advance the overall understanding as to why women continue to be victimized, by both men and women.</p>
