<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study is to describe the development and implementation of a new diabetes prevention intervention that combines the benefits of family support with the group office model. Intensive lifestyle modification can effectively delay the onset of type 2 diabetes, yet health providers are challenged in translating these results to their patients. The group outpatient visit model can provide a means to address prevention issues in a financially sustainable manner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721712461533">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Materials from the Diabetes Prevention Program and a previously developed group office visit program were combined to create the Families United/Familias Unidas curriculum. The session content utilized a multiculturally tailored approach designed to help participants decrease portion size, decrease carbohydrate intake, increase physical activity, and increase resiliency. Adults aged 18 to 70 were recruited who had any diabetes risk factors but did not have diabetes. Eligible participants enlisted a support person, aged 14 to 70, to join them in the 6-month group office visit intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721712461533">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty-nine pairs (n = 58) of primary participants plus support persons were recruited. Participants’ average age was 45; 74% were female; 56.9% identified themselves as white and 37.9% as Hispanic/Latino. Over one-third had 4 or more diabetes risk factors. Twelve family group office visits were delivered over 6 months. The attendance rate for those who attended at least one session was 72%.</p>

<sec id="section4-0145721712461533">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Group office visits can provide a new sustainable model for diabetes prevention and are a natural fit for primary care physicians in collaboration with other health care professionals, such as dieticians or diabetes educators.</p>

<body>
<p>Largely fueled by the obesity epidemic, type 2 diabetes represents a worldwide public health problem. In 2010, an estimated 285 million (6.4%) of the world’s population over 20 years old had diabetes, and this number is expected to reach 439 million (7.7%) by 2030.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712461533">1</xref></sup> In the United States, 25.8 million people (11.3% of the population) have diabetes, and certain racial/ethnic groups bear a greater burden of disease than others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712461533">2</xref></sup> African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanic/Latinos have higher diabetes-related death rates than non-Hispanic whites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712461533">3</xref></sup> The prevalence of diabetes among Mexican Americans is approximately 1.7 times higher than that of white non-Hispanics of a similar age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712461533">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712461533">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712461533">5</xref></sup> Effective, culturally appropriate interventions that can be adapted to the needs of multiple at-risk populations are critically needed to address these disparate disease outcomes.</p>
<p>While improved interventions aimed at diabetes control are vital, identifying persons at risk and preventing diabetes is the optimal solution. Prediabetes or impaired glucose tolerance affects an estimated 79 million people in the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712461533">2</xref></sup> and obesity, another major diabetes risk factor, affects 72 million, or one-third, of US adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712461533">6</xref></sup> People with prediabetes may have up to 20 times higher risk of developing diabetes than those with normal hemoglobin A1C values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712461533">7</xref></sup> Prediabetes is also one of several indicators of metabolic syndrome, along with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and increased adiposity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712461533">8</xref></sup> Ideally, interventions are necessary to prevent disease progression as early as possible to not only prevent diabetes but to avoid cardiovascular disease as well.</p>
<p>Lifestyle modification can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes up to 58%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712461533">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712461533"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712461533">11</xref></sup> The challenge lies in translating these lifestyle interventions to community and clinical settings in a cost-effective and sustainable manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712461533">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712461533"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712461533"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712461533"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712461533">16</xref></sup> Clinic-based interventions have the potential to be financially sustainable because they can be reimbursed by insurers, but prevention/lifestyle change is difficult to address in the busy clinical practice setting due to limited provider time, provider training, and other issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712461533">17</xref></sup> Group outpatient visit models were developed to address these barriers. Group visits can increase provider involvement in health education, enhance chronic disease management, and focus more attention on psychosocial determinants of health while addressing goals for physician productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712461533">18</xref></sup> Group office visits are increasing in popularity and are currently being promoted and studied by the American Academy of Family Physicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712461533">19</xref></sup> Typically, group office visits combine an individual medical assessment performed by a physician with a patient education program. Such visits have been used for well-child checks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712461533">20</xref></sup> coronary artery disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712461533">21</xref></sup> and diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712461533">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712461533"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712461533"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712461533">25</xref></sup> This model is economically feasible because physicians can see the same number of patients in an hour as they would in routine office visits and can bill the visit to insurers in the standard manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712461533">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712461533">26</xref></sup> This model also has a positive effect on patient and provider satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721712461533">27</xref></sup> Existing studies have shown some impact on hospital/emergency department utilization and process of care indicators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721712461533">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712461533">28</xref></sup> However, the group office visit model has not been well studied for adult disease prevention.</p>
<p>In addition, family member involvement has not been routinely included or studied in group diabetes prevention models. In cross-sectional diabetes studies, social support has been associated with better glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712461533">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712461533">30</xref></sup> Most research suggests that social support is positively linked to general health status and lifestyle change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721712461533">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721712461533">32</xref></sup> However, to date, no studies have examined the impact of social support on maintaining lifestyle change in a group office visit setting.</p>
<p>This article describes the development and implementation of a new diabetes prevention intervention that combines the benefits of family support with the group office model in a primary care setting. Based on previous work in cultural competence in the context of diabetes care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145721712461533">33</xref></sup> the group office visits in this study utilized a highly adaptable approach focusing on eliciting patients’ views of their disease, helping them identify their health goals, and assisting them in choosing appropriate lifestyle changes. We combined teaching materials from the Diabetes Prevention Program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712461533">34</xref></sup> (DPP) and a previously developed and implemented group office visit program. This article describes the curriculum and its implementation as measured by participant recruitment and retention. Clinical outcomes will be described in a subsequent article.</p>

<title>Group Office Visit Content Development</title>
<p>An ethnically diverse team—composed of 2 faculty family medicine physicians with previous expertise in diabetes care and group office visits, an expert in psychology, an expert in nutritional science, and a registered dietician—developed culturally appropriate lesson plans for the didactic portions of the group office visits. Materials from the DPP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712461533">34</xref></sup> and our previous group office visit program were combined to finalize the curriculum. The previous group office visit program focused on overweight children and their parents and was designed to help them make better choices regarding eating and increasing physical activity. All aspects of the project were approved by the University of Arizona Human Subjects Protection Program.</p>

<title>The Families United/Familias Unidas Curriculum</title>
<p>Similar to the DPP, the Families United/Familias Unidas program emphasized nutrition and physical activity. However, in contrast to the DPP’s 16 individualized sessions delivered over 24 weeks, Families United consisted of 12 group visits every 2 weeks over 6 months. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712461533">Table 1</xref> displays content for each group visit.</p>

<p>Families United emphasized a reduction in portion size and carbohydrates with the specific goals of educating participants about the sugar content of beverages and encouraging them to choose healthier alternatives, with water being the best choice. Reducing dietary fat was also addressed with a focus on reducing consumption of fast foods. Facilitators avoided labeling choices as good or bad, or healthy or unhealthy, but instead provided factual knowledge to assist participants in their decision making.</p>
<p>Participants also performed 15 minutes of physical activity at each session. Activities chosen required no special equipment and could be performed easily at home (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712461533">Table 1</xref>). Walking was emphasized the most. In the second session, participants received a pedometer and were instructed on its use. They were asked to keep a pedometer log, and at the beginning of each subsequent session, they shared with the group their daily average steps.</p>
<p>A key component of the patient-centered, multiculturally tailored Families United approach was to elicit participants’ explanatory models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721712461533">35</xref></sup> regarding their diabetes risk. This approach does not require prior knowledge about distinct ethnic or racial populations, and it can be applied regardless of the ethnic/racial composition of the group. At the first session, participants were invited to share their beliefs and feelings about their personal risk of diabetes, as well as experiences with diabetes in their families. The goals of 2.5 hours of physical activity and 7% weight loss from the DPP were shared with participants, and they were asked to set health goals that were meaningful for them.</p>
<p>Sessions were grounded in a cognitive-behavioral approach aimed at increasing participants’ resiliency skills. The concept of resilience or flexible thinking has been used in a variety of contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145721712461533">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145721712461533">37</xref></sup> and was a successful component of the children’s group office visit program. This approach involved teaching participants to recognize the link between stressful events and their beliefs, emotional responses based on these beliefs, and subsequent behaviors. This framework was applied to assist participants in understanding their behaviors around eating and physical activity.</p>
<p>Most important, each session utilized interactive learning strategies. Group members practiced mindful eating using a raisin, and they measured the fat content of various fast foods using shortening. In several sessions, they completed worksheets on physical activity planning, problem solving, goal setting, and other topics. This process was designed to reinforce and individualize participants’ plans for lifestyle change while allowing them to gain ideas and support from other group participants. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712461533">Table 1</xref> displays the active learning components for each session.</p>
<p>Instructor manuals contained detailed instructions regarding the educational content of each family group office visit as well as a set of PowerPoint slides. Participant manuals contained handouts specific to each session, homework assignments, and exercise instructions. (Copies of all program materials are publically available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fcm.arizona.edu/famunited">http://www.fcm.arizona.edu/famunited</ext-link>.) Booster sessions were conducted at 3 and 6 months after completion of the 12 core sessions. The content for these sessions is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712461533">Table 1</xref> and was developed with input from facilitators and participants.</p>

<sec id="section8-0145721712461533">
<title>Group Office Visit Format</title>
<p>Twelve 2-hour family group office visits were offered every 2 weeks for 6 months. Groups were offered in the evening and over the noon hour. As with previous groups, 5:00 or 5:30 <sc>pm</sc> was the preferred time for most participants. Groups were limited to 10 or fewer participants (5 pairs of participants and support persons). The format for each session was adapted from the cooperative health care clinic model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145721712461533">38</xref></sup> The group office visits were designed so that they could be conducted using the same staff required in a routine one-on-one medical visit (eg, a physician and an assistant). The assistant in Families United was a registered dietician. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721712461533">Table 2</xref> provides an example of the format of the family group office visit using “Session 3: Thinking Styles.”</p>

<p>Participants weighed themselves at the start of each session. The group facilitator reviewed the prior session’s materials and participants’ pedometer logs. Their individual average steps were documented on a poster on the meeting room wall, which included their prior pedometer log averages, thus allowing participants to track their progress.</p>
<p>The physician facilitating the group performed individual medical assessments lasting approximately 5 minutes and completed a progress note. At each visit, the physician inquired about participants’ physical activity, dietary changes, consumption of sweetened beverages, television/computer time, and stress management. The physical exam included blood pressure measurement and assessment of heart and lungs. Concurrent to physician assessments, the dietician facilitated a general discussion with the remaining group members, focused on successes and barriers to lifestyle change. Once physical assessments were complete, the dietician and the physician cofacilitated the group discussion on the main session topic. After this discussion, the group spent 15 minutes performing one of the physical activities shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712461533">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>All primary participants were required to identify a household or family member to accompany them to the family group office visits. These individuals had to be 14 to 70 years old. Unlike the primary participants, these individuals could have diabetes, and they did not need to have diabetes risk factors to be eligible. Each pair of participants was also asked to invite other family household members to participate in the group visits. Early in the enrollment process, it was noted that requiring a family member to attend was limiting participants’ eligibility. Therefore, the original study protocol was modified to allow inclusion of friends as support persons.</p>
<p>Community and clinic-based recruitment strategies were employed. Community recruitment included newspaper advertisement and posters and pamphlets in community settings (eg, public libraries, YMCAs, swap meets, family-oriented festivals). Clinic-based recruitment included posters and pamphlets in physicians’ offices and 2 affiliated hospitals, presentations at physician faculty meetings, and e-mails to physicians asking them to refer patients. All recruitment materials were in English, with the exception of the study title, “Families United/Familias Unidas,” which was designed to be welcoming to multiple ethnicities in this Southwestern community. Letters were also sent to patients who attended 2 large family-medicine clinics. Clinic staff identified patients with the following diagnoses and International Classification of Diseases–9 codes from billing records: benign hypertension (401.1), hyperlipidemia (272.4), hypertension (401.9), obesity (278.00), pure hypercholesterolemia (272.0), abnormal glucose (790.29), morbid obesity (278.01), pure hypertriglyceridemia (272.1), and impaired fasting glucose (790.21). According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10064 patients were identified as potentially eligible primary participants from the 2 clinics.</p>

<p>Twenty-nine pairs of primary participants plus accompanying family members/friends were recruited to the study between September 2009 and August 2010 for a total of 58 participants. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721712461533">Figure 1</xref> summarizes the enrollment process. Fourteen of the pairs were married/intimate partners; 10 pairs were friends; 3 pairs were mothers/daughters; and 2 pairs were adult siblings. Only one additional household member (outside the 29 pairs) was recruited, bringing the total number of participants to 59. Of note, many households contained children younger than 14 who were ineligible for the study. The group of 19 eligible household members who did not participate consisted primarily of husbands and older teenage children.</p>

<title>Study Retention</title>
<p>Fourteen participants (7 pairs) attended the baseline consenting and data collection visit but never came to any of the group office visits. Reasons for nonattendance included family issues, separation, moving, and too much study-related paperwork. These individuals were significantly younger than those that attended at least 1 group office visit (37.0 ± 7.9 vs 47.9 ± 12.2 years, <italic>P</italic> = .001). There were no significant differences by race/ethnicity or income, but these individuals were also more likely to have a lower educational level (<italic>P</italic> = .046) and be on Medicaid (<italic>P</italic> = .002).</p>

<title>Attendance</title>
<p>Forty-five participants came to at least 1 group visit. They were distributed across 6 groups with an average size of 7 participants. The average overall attendance rate for these participants was 72% (range = 8.3% to 100%). Five participants started group office visits but did not continue. Reasons included pregnancy, other health issues, moving out of the area, family health issues, and changes in work status. Thirty-five percent of participants who completed the group visit intervention were Hispanic/Latino, and a majority of these (64.2%) were Mexican American. The program completion rate for Hispanics/Latinos was 100% for those that came to at least 1 session.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We successfully developed and implemented a family/friend group office visit program for diabetes prevention that included materials from the DPP with a novel emphasis on resiliency. This pilot study is the first that we are aware of that focused on group office visits for diabetes prevention. Group visits are ideal for health promotion and disease prevention. They provide a mechanism for providers to allot time for patient education. Most important, they allow an opportunity to address psychosocial determinants of health,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712461533">18</xref></sup> an integral step to promoting lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>Over one-third of the study participants were of Hispanic/Latino background. Hispanics/Latinos, especially Mexican Americans, have higher rates of diabetes, diabetes complications, and diabetes-related deaths compared to non-Hispanic whites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712461533">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712461533">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145721712461533">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145721712461533">42</xref></sup> Given this higher disease burden, recruitment of these at-risk individuals was a major study aim. The DPP was effective across all racial/ethnic groups,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712461533">9</xref></sup> but relatively few studies have specifically examined translating DPP prevention to Hispanic/Latino populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145721712461533">43</xref></sup> The Families United study population had a proportion of Hispanics/Latinos close to the city population demographics (41.6%) and higher than the county (31.6%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0145721712461533">44</xref></sup> or clinic (24%) populations.</p>
<p>Similar to the findings of Hispanic/Latino-focused community-based interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145721712461533">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145721712461533">46</xref></sup> the attendance and retention rates for Families United were high. Families United utilized a patient-centered approach that focused on eliciting participants’ explanatory models of disease causation, explaining the biomedical model of diabetes/diabetes prevention, and then helping participants set meaningful goals. This approach is powerful in that it is applicable regardless of the racial/ethnic composition of the group. The completion rate for the Hispanics/Latinos was 100% for those that attended at least 1 session, thereby supporting the acceptability of this intervention and group visits for this population.</p>
<p>Another major aim of Families United was to examine the effect of social support on diabetes prevention. Social support and social networks have been shown to be important for diabetes management and obesity treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712461533">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721712461533">31</xref></sup> and they have been utilized to deliver diabetes prevention to minority, high-risk groups in community settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712461533">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145721712461533">45</xref></sup> Social support in the context of group office visits has not been well studied. In the current study, primary participants were able to successfully recruit a support person to accompany them, but restricting this person to a family member was challenging; thus, the study protocol was modified to include friends. Support persons had similar diabetes risk factors as the primary participants and thus may also have received benefit from the program beyond merely a supportive role.</p>
<sec id="section16-0145721712461533">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Beyond the recruitment of primary participants and support persons, recruitment of additional household members was not successful. This may have been due to the small average household size (3.2 persons per household), but overall, only 0.5% of eligible other household members were recruited. Many households contained young children, requiring someone to stay home and provide child care. To overcome this issue, young children could be included in the group office visit, which may help parents with child care concerns participate. This approach has had promising results in one school-based diabetes prevention program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145721712461533">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Families United, less than one-fifth of participants enrolled were on Medicaid, and those with Medicaid and lower educational level were more likely to never attend a group office visit. Lower socioeconomic status is associated with higher prevalence of diabetes and diabetes risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0145721712461533">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0145721712461533">49</xref></sup> Reducing disparities requires targeted efforts to produce more rapid improvement in the health of the most disadvantaged, compared to the rest of society.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721712461533">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0145721712461533">50</xref></sup> Future research should emphasize recruiting and retaining these at-risk groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0145721712461533">
<title>Clinical Implications</title>
<p>Based on the study findings, targeting those with obesity (which can be readily obtained from billing information) or those with a family history of diabetes would be effective recruitment strategies. Referral by a primary care physician, either in person or via mail, may have increased potential participants’ awareness of their personal diabetes risk or motivated them toward prevention. The lack of response to newspaper advertisements may be due to declining newspaper readership or to decreased community awareness of risk factors for diabetes, such as obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0145721712461533">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diabetes prevention group office visits could be implemented in a cost-neutral manner. A physician and assistant staffed the group visits, similar to the staffing for regular office visits. The assistant in Families United was a registered dietician; however, group office visits would be an ideal setting for collaboration with a certified diabetes educator, a medical assistant, or a nurse.</p>
<p>The average of 2.6 patients seen per hour in a group office visit is consistent with national averages for family medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0145721712461533">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0145721712461533">53</xref></sup> The visits can be billed as a 99213, which is equivalent to a routine medical visit. Depending on the insurer, it may be possible to bill for the services of a dietician or diabetes educator, thus increasing cost-effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0145721712461533">54</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0145721712461533">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Primary care practices are ideal locations to identify at-risk patients, educate them about their diabetes risk, and help them facilitate lifestyle changes. The costs associated with delivery of group office visits can be borne by insurers and not the patients, eliminating a potential major barrier to diabetes prevention with likely long-term cost savings to those same insurers. Group office visits provide a new sustainable model for diabetes prevention education that is financially viable and is a natural fit for primary care physicians in collaboration with other health care professionals, such as dieticians or diabetes educators.</p>
