<abstract>
<p>Time perspective is a cultural behavioral concept that reflects individuals’ orientations or attitudes toward the past, present, or future. Individuals’ time perspectives influence their choices regarding daily activities. Time perspective is an important consideration when teaching adolescents about the importance of being physically active. However, little is known about the relationship between time perspective and physical activity among adolescents. The purpose of this study was to determine the time perspective of central Appalachian adolescents and explore the relationship between time perspective and physical activity. This study was guided by The theory of planned behavior (TPB). One hundred and ninety-three students completed surveys to examine time perspective and physical activity behaviors. Data were collected in one school. Results of this study can inform school nurses and high school guidance counselors about the importance of promoting a future-oriented time perspective to improve physical activity and educational outcomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Physical inactivity among adolescents is a significant problem that could result in increased incidence of obesity and overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840512456552">Prasad, St. Hilaire, Wong, Peterson, &amp; Loftin, 2009</xref>). Currently, for children and adolescents aged 2–19, the prevalence of obesity is 17% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512456552">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012</xref>). Overweight adolescents are usually overweight as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512456552">Freedman et al., 2005</xref>). They are more likely to develop chronic physical disease, suffer emotional problems, develop a negative self-identity, and have increased health care costs and less likely to continue their education past high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512456552">Finkelstein &amp; Trogdon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512456552">Hawley, Beckman, &amp; Bishop, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840512456552">Neighmond, 2010</xref>). Encouraging adolescents to develop regular physical activity regimens is critical to ensuring they are healthier in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840512456552">Hortz, Stevens, Holden, &amp; Petosa, 2009</xref>). Young people are increasingly sedentary as they enter adolescence and young adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840512456552">Harrell et al., 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512456552">CDC (2011)</xref>, adolescents entering the upper high school grades are at increased risk of decreased physical activity levels.</p>
<p>The lack of physical activity in school has been attributed to implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001. The NCLB Act compels school divisions to emphasize student performance in core subjects (math, reading, and science) while excluding physical education. As a result, resources are geared toward the core areas while physical education opportunities diminish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840512456552">Mears, 2008</xref>). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840512456552">National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE, 2010)</xref>, 65% of high school students do not meet recommendations for daily physical activity. Forty-five states require high school students to take physical education classes in order to graduate. Of those 45 states, 38 require only two credits of physical education to graduate which is equivalent to 2 years of physical education (NASPE, 2010).</p>
<p>According to data from a sample of 9,701 high school students attending public and private schools in the United States, only 15.3% of students met the Healthy People 2020 (HP 2020) health objectives for participation in daily aerobic physical activity (≥ to 60 min per day). A higher percentage of the lower grades (9th and 10th, 18.5% and 15.3%) met the HP 2020 goals for aerobic activity in comparison to the upper grades (11th and 12th, 13.3% and 13.1%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512456552">CDC, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Adolescents in rural areas have unique challenges related to physical activity. The built environment in rural areas inhibit opportunities for physical activity for adolescents, that is, the roads are narrow with few sidewalks and the long distances to school are not favorable for walking or bicycling. Therefore, opportunities for physical activity are limited for rural adolescents if they do not participate in school-sponsored sports. Because physical education is not required in later high school years, opportunities for physical activity must be found outside the school setting. Unfortunately, in rural areas, parks and recreation centers are not readily accessible and transportation to and from these facilities may be limited.</p>
<p>Children and adolescents in rural central Appalachia are more sedentary and have a higher prevalence of obesity than the rest of the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840512456552">Hortz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840512456552">Schoenberg, Hatcher, &amp; Dignan, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840512456552">Pancoska et al. (2009)</xref> reported 50% of adolescents residing in one rural Appalachian region were obese. Obese adolescents are more likely to be depressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059840512456552">Merten, Wickrama, &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>) and anxious. In addition, obese adolescents exhibit poor social functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059840512456552">Swallen, Reither, Haas, &amp; Meier, 2005</xref>) which may hinder public participation in physical activity. Adolescents who do not function well socially may be too shy or too unsure of their ability to participate.</p>
<p>The physical activity practices of adolescents are not well known. In a study of children and adolescents aged 11 to 16, choice of activity promoted participation in physical activity; barriers to participation in physical activity were feelings of incompetence and negative body image perceptions especially among females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059840512456552">Rees et al., 2006</xref>). Goal setting appears to be a successful approach for improving the physical activity levels among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512456552">Fong &amp; Hall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059840512456552">Shilts, Horowitz, &amp; Townsend, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Goal setting is characteristic of a future time perspective. Time perspective is a cultural characteristic that reflects an individual’s attitude toward time. A future orientation has been positively associated with higher socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512456552">Diener, 2000</xref>) and positive health among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059840512456552">Zaleski, Cycon, &amp; Kurc, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840512456552">Luszczynska, Gibbons, Piko, and Tekozel (2004)</xref> reported future orientation was positively associated with physical activity among adolescents in Hungary and Poland. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1059840512456552">
<title>Time Perspective</title>
<p>Time perspective is a personal attitude toward time. Recently, the majority of the literature on time perspective uses the perspectives identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840512456552">Zimbardo and Boyd (2008)</xref>, past-negative, past-positive, present-fatalistic, present-hedonistic, and future time perspectives. The past-negative time perspective is characterized by recalling past events negatively. The past-positive time perspective is characterized by recalling past events optimistically. For example, when a past-negative individual remembers a family picnic, they will remember the bumble bees flying around the food and how hot it was. When a past-positive individual remembers the same picnic, they will remember the coolness of the breeze and how well the food tasted. The present-fatalistic individual believes their future is hopeless and their fate is predestined. The present-hedonistic individual is a risk taker. They enjoy taking risks and act impulsively. The future-oriented individual will act conscientiously, set goals for themselves, and work diligently to accomplish those goals.</p>
<p>Time perspective has been explored in many disciplines for more than a century. Most of the research on time perspective has explored the relationship between time perspective and health behaviors. Evidence suggests time perspective is related to health behaviors. A present orientation has been positively associated with alcohol, drug, and tobacco use among college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512456552">Keough, Zimbardo, &amp; Boyd, 1999</xref>). In another study, adolescents with a future orientation were less likely to abuse alcohol and other substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512456552">Haegerich &amp; Tolan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512456552">Adams and Nettle (2009)</xref> reported a future time perspective was positively associated with increased frequency of physical activity among adults. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840512456552">Crockett, Wienman, Hankins, and Marteau (2009)</xref> recommend incorporating time perspective into current behavioral theories to improve the predictive and explanatory power of the theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059840512456552">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>This study was guided by the theory of planned behavior (TPB), a social behavioral theory used extensively to understand the physical activity behaviors of adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512456552">Ajzen, 1991</xref>; Trinh, Rhodes, &amp; Ryan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059840512456552">2008</xref>). According to the TPB, human behaviors are guided by attitudes toward the behavior, normative beliefs, control beliefs, and intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512456552">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Attitudes toward physical activity are either positive or negative evaluations of physical activity. Normative beliefs or subjective norms are individuals’ perceptions that significant others believe they should be physically active. Control beliefs or perceived behavioral control (PBC) includes individuals’ beliefs in their abilities to be physically active (self-efficacy) and their perceptions about whether or not they will have the opportunity and resources to participate in physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512456552">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010</xref>). Resources for participation in physical activity are an important consideration for adolescents because rural adolescents depend on parents and other family members for transportation and fees associated with participation in physical activity. In particular, when adolescents participate in school-sponsored sports they may pay for transportation and uniforms. Therefore, adolescents may believe they can be physically active, but they may not believe they have opportunities to participate due to finances or lack of family support.</p>
<p>Intention, a significant construct within the TPB, precedes the actual performance of the behavior. Intentions are also influenced by attitudes, normative beliefs, and control beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512456552">Ajzen, 1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512456552">Epel, Bandura, and Zimbardo (1999)</xref> linked the TPB to time perspective. They explored the relationship between time perspective and control beliefs (self-efficacy) among homeless adults. In this study, a future orientation was associated with high levels of self-efficacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512456552">Dombrowski and Luszczynska (2009)</xref> explored the relationship between planning (a characteristic of a future time perspective), intention and physical activity among adolescents aged 13–17. Significant positive relationships were found between intention and physical activity and planning and physical activity. In this study, it was hypothesized that time perspective will influence physical activity behavior through intention, physical activity attitudes, normative beliefs, and PBC.</p>
<sec id="section4-1059840512456552">
<title>Central Appalachia</title>
<p>The literature describes Appalachians as present-fatalistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512456552">Coyne, Demian-Popescu, &amp; Friend, 2006</xref>). Fatalists live in the present. They believe they have no control over their future and are unable to connect today’s actions with future consequences. This time perspective is not favorable to health promotion activities. In the case of physical activity, the results of being physically active may not be readily evident to the individual. When individuals view the world in the present or past perspective, the future is either negative or not well thought-out. Therefore, being physically active to enjoy optimal health in the future is not a consideration.</p>
<p>The role of time perspective on the physical activity behaviors of central Appalachian adolescents is not well understood. It is important to gain an understanding of the factors that influence adolescents’ choice to participate in physical activity and adhere to health promotion practices. Knowledge gained can be used to develop intervention programs aimed at promoting physical activity among rural adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512456552">Chatzisarantis, Hagger, Wang, &amp; Thogersen-Ntoumani, 2009</xref>). The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a relationship between time perspective and physical activity attitudes, intentions, and behaviors among adolescents residing in central Appalachia. It was hypothesized that future-oriented adolescents would have positive attitudes toward physical activity and more frequent physical activity participation. </p>

<sec id="section5-1059840512456552" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study used a descriptive, correlational design. All students in grades 9 through 12 attending a high school in Central Appalachia were invited to participate in this study. The East Tennessee State University Institutional Review Board and school officials of the district where the study was conducted reviewed and approved this study prior to data collection. School officials provided written permission to proceed with passive parental consent.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria included the ability to read and write English and participate in mild to strenuous exercise. Exclusion criteria included students with significant physical disabilities, because activity levels were self-reported, and intellectual disabilities, to the extent students could not read or understand the surveys. A significant physical disability would limit the individual’s ability to participate in physical activities. For example, a student who needs a wheelchair or crutches for ambulation may not be physically able to perform various physical activities at a mild, moderate, or strenuous degree of intensity. Physical activity at varying degrees of intensity is one of the study variables, and study subjects must have the ability to perform the activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059840512456552">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Information letters describing the study were sent home to parents of all students attending the high school (<italic>N </italic>= 280). The information letters included instructions for students who did not want to participate in the study; they were instructed to sign the letter and return it within 2 weeks to the school employee who distributed the letters to them. Students who wanted to participate signed assent forms before completing surveys.</p>
<p>Surveys were completed during March and April of 2011. Students were surveyed during their first block class. Manila envelopes with the appropriate number of surveys, attached coversheets, and directions for completion were given to each first block teacher. Coversheets were numbered beginning with the number one. When students were finished, they placed completed or uncompleted surveys and coversheets in the manila envelope. With the teachers’ assistance, the researcher created a list of student names and corresponding numbers. The researcher returned to the room after a designated time period and collected the envelopes with the surveys. Completion of the survey took 20 min.</p>
<p>On the first day of data collection, only 17 of the 52 senior students were at school. The rest of the senior students were either absent or attending dual enrollment classes off campus.</p>
<p>Therefore, additional data collection was necessary for senior students to obtain a representative sample from this group. This was accomplished by asking the guidance counselor which day and time would be most favorable to survey senior students.</p>
<p>Five weeks after the first survey, the second survey was administered. Five weeks is the time frame in which memory is reduced and individuals are more likely to report actual behaviors rather than prior stated intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512456552">Chatzisarantis et al., 2009</xref>). The second survey included the leisure time exercise questionnaire (LTEQ), a measure of actual physical activity. Students placed their assigned number from the list created by the researcher on the second survey. In this way, data from the first survey regarding intention to participate in physical activity were linked to the second survey, a measure of actual physical activity. The same data collection procedures for the first survey were used to collect data for the second survey. Completion of the second survey took 5 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059840512456552">
<title>Instruments</title>
<sec id="section8-1059840512456552">
<title>Time Perspective</title>
<p>Time perspective was measured using the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI) a 56-item self-report survey consisting of five subscales, past-negative, past-positive, present-hedonistic, present-fatalistic, and future time perspective. Items were scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Subscale means determined orientation toward a specific time perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840512456552">Zimbardo &amp; Boyd, 2008</xref>). In a pilot study with like participants, Cronbach’s α coefficients for the five subscales ranged from .64 to .86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512456552">Gulley, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1059840512456552">
<title>Physical Activity Attitudes</title>
<p>The TPB variables were assessed using survey items identified from the current literature that have been tested by other researchers and demonstrated reliability. The TPB variables included physical activity attitude, subjective norm, PBC, and intention. Physical activity attitude was measured by the mean of the following 6 items: “Being physically active would be . . .,” on a 5-point scale of useful to useless, beneficial to harmful, desirable to undesirable, good to bad, enjoyable to unenjoyable, and interesting to boring. This scale was reported to be reliable (Cronbach’s α .85) among female adolescents ages 13–17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512456552">Baker, Little, &amp; Brownell, 2003</xref>). The α coefficient for this sample was .55.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1059840512456552">
<title>Normative Beliefs</title>
<p>Normative beliefs, the influence of family and friends, was measured by rating 3 items about three caring referents including mother, father, and friends. The items included: (1) “My (caring referent) would approve of my being physically active,” (2) “My (caring referent) thinks I should be physically active,” and (3) “My (caring referent) is-are physically active.” Items were rated by the participants on a scale of 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) to 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>). The mean of the 9 items was the measure of subjective norms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512456552">Baker et al. (2003)</xref> reported a Cronbach’s α of .75 for this scale among adolescent females aged 13 to 17. The α coefficient for this sample was .81.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1059840512456552">
<title>PBC</title>
<p>Four items were used to measure PBC including: (1) “I control whether or not I am physically active on a regular basis.” (2) “If I wanted to, I could easily be physically active on a regular basis.” (3) “Being physically active on a regular basis is entirely up to me.” (4) “Being physically active on a regular basis is possible.” Participants rated responses on a scale of 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) to 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>).</p>
<p>In addition, self-efficacy was measured using the following 4 items: (1) “I believe that I have the ability to be physically active on a regular basis.” (2) “I am confident that I am capable of being physically active on a regular basis.” (3) “I am capable of being physically active on a regular basis.” (4) “I am certain that I can be physically active on a regular basis.” Participants rated the items on a scale of 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) to 1 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512456552">Keats, Culos-Reed, Courneya, and McBride (2007)</xref> reported a Cronbach’s α of .89 for a similar version of this scale among adolescents 15–20 years of age. The mean score of the 8 items determined the measure of PBC. The α coefficient for this sample was .92.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1059840512456552">
<title>Intention</title>
<p>Responses to 3 items determined intention including: (1) “I plan to participate in vigorous physical activities for 15 minutes a time at least three or more times a week during my free time for the next five weeks,” (2) “ I expect I will participate in vigorous physical activities for 15 minutes a time at least three or more times a week during my free time for the next five weeks,” and (3) “I intend to participate in vigorous physical activities for 15 minutes a time at least three or more times a week during my free time for the next five weeks.” Participants rated responses on a scale of 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) to 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>). The mean of the 3 items determined the measure of intention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840512456552">Hagger, Chatzisarantis, Biddle, and Orbell (2001)</xref> used a similar version of this scale. The scale was reliable (Cronbach’s α .70) among adolescents 12–14 years of age. The α coefficient for this sample was .91. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1059840512456552">
<title>Physical Activity</title>
<p>Actual participation in physical activity was assessed using the Godin’s LTEQ. The LTEQ is a 4-item self-reported frequency of mild, moderate, and strenuous exercise behavior along with the frequency with which one engages in regular activity long enough to perspire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840512456552">Godin &amp; Shephard, 1997</xref>). Participation in a school-sponsored sport was determined by the students’ response to the following question, “Do you participate in a school sponsored sport (s)?”</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section15-1059840512456552">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>One hundred and ninety-three students completed surveys (69% response rate). Eight surveys were excluded due to missing data. Data from 185 students were included in this study. Two students chose not to participate in the study. The study sample included students in the 9th (28.1%), 10th (28.6%), 11th (27.0%), and 12th (13.5%) grades. Students ranged in age from 13 to 19; 89 were male and 94 were female. Two surveys had missing gender data. One hundred and fifty-one students reported being Caucasian, 27 reported other, and 7 declined to report. Sixty-three percent participated in a school-sponsored sport and 91% reported they planned to go to college (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512456552">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adolescents living in the rural areas of the Appalachian region have significantly higher incidence of obesity than adolescents in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512456552">Cochran, 2008</xref>). Physical activity is an important contributor to obesity. Appalachian adolescents report less than recommended rates of physical activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840512456552">Hortz et al., 2009</xref>). Understanding the physical activity behaviors of adolescents is critical to providing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing physical activity for this population.</p>
<p>Study participants tended toward hedonism, a perspective not typically conducive to health promotion teaching. For example, hedonists enjoy risk-taking and impulsive behaviors associated with unsafe sexual practices and substance abuse among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840512456552">Zimbardo &amp; Boyd, 2008</xref>). However, significant positive correlations between hedonism and participation in strenuous activity and hedonism and behavioral control were also found. Hedonists have high energy and enjoy being active. They have strong beliefs in their abilities. Interventions must focus on ways to harness hedonistic energy in ways that will promote daily participation in physical activity.</p>
<p>Study results indicate that participants are least likely to be fatalistic, contrary to the current literature describing Appalachians. Female participants were more future oriented than males, consistent with the time perspective literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840512456552">Mello &amp; Worrell, 2006</xref>). Are these findings a reflection of developmental gender differences or do these findings represent a time perspective profile that may change over time?</p>
<p>Study results indicated students not planning to go to college were more fatalistic; students planning to go to college were more future oriented. Guidance counselors could use results of this study to encourage practices that promote future-oriented approaches across the curriculum. To-do lists and goal setting are future-oriented practices that promote student success and positive attitudes toward attending college. In this study, a large percentage (91%) of participants reported planning to go to college.</p>
<p>Study participants reporting no participation in a school-sponsored sport scored higher on the past-negative time perspective scale than participants who were involved in a school-sponsored sport. Participation in school-sponsored sports provides opportunities to develop connections and memorable experiences with friends. Connectedness with parents and other family members is necessary for participation in school-sponsored sports as they often provide transportation and funds needed to participate in practices and games.</p>
<p>The TPB is a behavioral model that is widely used to examine physical activity; however, it has only been used in a few studies exploring physical activity among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059840512456552">Trinh, Rhodes, &amp; Ryan, 2008</xref>). According to the TPB, intention is a significant predictor of performance of a specific behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512456552">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010</xref>). Time perspective is an attitude toward time that also influences specific behaviors. Study results indicated a positive relationship between future time perspective and intention to participate in physical activity. If individuals are future oriented, their attitudes toward physical activity are more likely to be positive and they do intend to be physically active.</p>
<p>In addition, if individuals live in the past or present with little regard to the future their attitudes toward participation in physical activity, as a way of promoting future health, is more likely to be negative. Study results indicated a significant negative relationship between past-negative time perspective and physical activity attitudes. Students scoring higher on the past-negative time perspective tended to score lower on the physical activity attitude scale.</p>
<p>A positive relationship was found between future time perspective and influence of family and friends. A future time perspective is optimistic; reported high influence of family and friends predicts future-oriented adolescents with parents and other family members who are also future oriented.</p>
<p>A positive relationship was found between the past-positive time perspective and the influence of family and friends as well as past-positive time perspective and behavioral control. Past positive individuals are family oriented and have positive memories of past events. These results are a reflection of Appalachian culture characterized by frequent family gatherings for meals, birthdays. or holidays. These events create positive memories for most participants. In addition, positive memories promote social competence which enhances behavioral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512456552">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section18-1059840512456552">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>Study results are not generalizable to other populations. Students who were home schooled or attending an alternative school were not included in the study. The first survey was lengthy and students may have become fatigued during completion of the survey. Surveys were behavioral self-reports which may threaten the validity of study results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512456552">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010</xref>). The low α coefficient for physical activity attitudes could be attributed to decreased variability in the responses. Students may feel it is socially desirable to have positive attitudes toward physical activity and be physically active; therefore, they may have reported what they felt was socially desirable rather than their true attitudes toward physical activity and actual physical activity behavior.</p>

<sec id="section19-1059840512456552">
<title>Implications for School Nursing Practice</title>
<p>Daily physical education benefits students who are past and present-oriented. The physical activity and the time frame is planned for them. Unfortunately, high school students are not required to take physical education every year. School nurses can influence policy regarding daily physical education for students by supporting practices that promote daily physical education for all students. For example, school nurses could express the importance of daily physical activity to physical education teachers.</p>
<p>Increased physical activity significantly improves cognitive function in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059840512456552">Sibley &amp; Etnier, 2003</xref>) and research has demonstrated that increased hours of physical education improves the academic performance of elementary school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059840512456552">Tremarche, Robinson, &amp; Graham, 2007</xref>). School nurses could become an active member of the district School Health Advisory Board and promote daily physical education for all students which may guide policy that includes daily physical education.</p>
<p>Individuals’ time perspective can be modified. For students who are past or present-oriented, there are ways to promote a more future-oriented perspective. School nurses can encourage students’ intentions to participate in daily physical activity by encouraging future-oriented practices such as goal setting and planning optimal times for physical activity. School nurses can provide and encourage students to use exercise diaries to record dates and times they intend to participate in physical activity. This intention to participate in physical activity promotes performance of the behavior and student progress can be tracked with the diaries.</p>
<p>School nurses provide health education and counseling to students, faculty, and parents. Knowledge gained from this study could inform school nurses about the role of time perspective on physical activity behaviors among rural adolescents. Results of this study indicated future-oriented students intend to participate in physical activity; therefore, school nurses should promote future-oriented practices in school by encouraging students to set daily physical activity goals for themselves. In addition, school nurses could provide a newsletter for faculty and parents encouraging them to set daily physical activity goals.</p>
<p>School nurses can also promote positive attitudes toward physical activity. Promoting enjoyable activities such as hiking, hunting, or dancing may be a better way to encourage physical activity among adolescents. To promote behavioral control, school nurses should encourage students to engage in physical activities that they like and feel competent doing.</p>
<p>School nurses promote student learning by promoting healthy practices such as physical activity. School nurses have opportunities to develop a personal connection with students which may enhance student success in reaching health-related goals. Study results indicated a positive correlation between future time perspective and intention to participate in physical activity. The stronger the intention, the more likely the individual was to perform the behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512456552">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section21-1059840512456552">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Obesity is a major health problem among adolescents in rural communities. Interventions aimed at improving the frequency of physical activity behaviors must have a theoretical basis and include cultural considerations. This research has demonstrated relationships between time perspective and TPB constructs among adolescents residing in Central Appalachia. These relationships must be considered when developing and implementing physical activity programs for rural adolescents.</p>
