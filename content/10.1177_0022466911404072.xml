<abstract>
<p>Paraprofessionals are widely employed in response to intervention (RTI) settings to provide instruction to students at-risk for reading disabilities. However, little research has addressed effective and efficient ways to train these paraprofessionals to deliver instruction with high fidelity. In addition, given the limited time and finances available in most districts, training needs to be as efficient as possible. This study assessed the effects of a 5-hour fluency training package on the presentation rates, praise rates, and error correction accuracy of five paraprofessionals providing supplemental reading instruction within an RTI system using a multiple baseline design across participants. Students’ reading accuracy and percentage of intervals with on-task behavior were evaluated. Paraprofessionals generally increased their presentation rates, praise rates, and error correction accuracy. Students’ behaviors were affected less.</p>

<body>
<p>Response to intervention (RTI) is a framework for providing interventions for students at a level of intensity that is appropriate to meet their individual needs. A goal of RTI is to provide early intervention for students who are at risk for academic and behavioral difficulty rather than waiting for students to fail and be provided intervention solely through special education services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022466911404072">Fuchs, Mock, Morgan, &amp; Young, 2003</xref>). RTI typically includes multiple “tiers” of increasingly intensive and/or individualized instruction, ranging from general education classroom instruction, to small group, to individualized instruction. This model often requires additional (or reassigned) staff to provide small group and individualized instruction. To meet this need, paraprofessionals have been employed successfully to provide intervention or support services, particularly in reading (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022466911404072">Gunn, Smolkowski, Biglan, &amp; Black, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466911404072">Lane, Fletcher, Carter, Dejud, &amp; DeLorenzo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022466911404072">Miller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022466911404072">Vadasy, Sanders, &amp; Tudor, 2007</xref>). In these studies, paraprofessionals provided supplemental reading instruction to individuals or small groups of students. To train paraprofessionals, researchers typically provided didactic training and practice with feedback prior to implementation. This training was usually followed by weekly observations and feedback on implementation fidelity. However, the focus of these studies was on the efficacy of the intervention for students; paraprofessional training was an incidental component of the study. None of the studies experimentally evaluated the effects or features of paraprofessional training. This literature has shown research-based interventions <italic>can</italic> be conducted by paraprofessionals with good fidelity and positive student outcomes; however, the researchers provided more training and supervision than would be available in most schools. The positive outcomes obtained in the research may not reflect likely outcomes in nonresearch settings.</p>
<p>Several studies have noted that paraprofessionals rarely receive adequate training (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022466911404072">Downing, Ryndak, &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022466911404072">Pickett, Likins, &amp; Wallace, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022466911404072">Riggs &amp; Mueller, 2001</xref>). Although administrators have expressed that paraprofessional training is a high priority (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022466911404072">Giangreco, Edelman, &amp; Broer, 2003</xref>), limited budgets and time restrict the amount and quality of training for paraprofessionals. Thus, it is important to identify specific efficient professional development practices for paraprofessionals that can produce high fidelity of implementation and positive student outcomes within the resource limitations common in school districts.</p>

<title>Training for Instructional Staff</title>
<p>The literature on paraprofessional training is more focused on implementation of interventions for students, rather than a systematic research base on approaches for effectively training paraprofessionals. Therefore, the search for effective and efficient methods for training paraprofessionals must be broadened to include research on training teachers and staff in clinical settings. Researchers have found that affecting student behavior through staff training in applied settings is not easy. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022466911404072">Yoon, Duncan, Lee, Scarloss, and Shapley (2007)</xref> found that studies in which teachers received at least 14 hours of professional development showed positive effects on student outcomes. Several literature reviews on diverse topics related to training of instructional staff have found that didactic training (e.g., training outside the classroom, and typically not including practice of skills) is the least likely staff development model to result in generalization of teaching skills to the classroom or clinic setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022466911404072">Joyce &amp; Showers, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022466911404072">Noell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022466911404072">Rose &amp; Church, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022466911404072">Scheeler, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022466911404072">Joyce and Showers (2002)</xref> noted, “The gradual addition of the informational, demonstration, and practice training elements does not appear to noticeably affect transfer (effect size of 0.00 for information or theory; theory plus demonstration; and theory, demonstration, and feedback)” (p. 77). Researchers have found that practice of the skills outside the classroom may result in some acquisition of the skill, but trainees typically do not readily apply what has been learned to the classroom setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022466911404072">Kretlow and Bartholomew (2010)</xref> found that studies on coaching teachers in evidence-based practices reported positive effects on teaching skills. Researchers have identified frequent (daily or weekly) performance feedback or peer consultation as the most effective means for increasing generalization of instructional skills to the classroom setting.</p>

<title>Intensive Training Prior to Implementation</title>
<p>Several recent studies have demonstrated that training outside the classroom with sufficient intensity and practice prior to implementing an intervention or assessment may result in adequate acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022466911404072">Iwata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022466911404072">Roscoe &amp; Fisher, 2008</xref>) and maintenance of these skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022466911404072">Lerman, Tetreault, Hovanetz, Strobel, &amp; Garro, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022466911404072">Lerman, Vorndran, Addison, &amp; Kuhn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022466911404072">Moore &amp; Fisher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022466911404072">Slider, Noell, &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>). In some of these studies, the need for individual feedback after initial training was minimal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022466911404072">Roscoe and Fisher (2008)</xref> provided training on a relatively simple skill (conducting preference assessments), so the acquisition of this skill in a brief training format outside the classroom is not surprising. However, in the other studies, participants learned a variety of relatively complex skills that required differential responding to student interactions in different conditions (e.g., functional analysis procedures; time-out) and applied different instructional or behavior management skills (e.g., multiple discrete trial training procedures; providing praise appropriately). In two of these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022466911404072">Iwata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022466911404072">Roscoe &amp; Fisher, 2008</xref>), the skills were adequately acquired in the training setting, but no assessments of the generalization of the skills to the applied settings were conducted. In the other studies, participants in relatively brief, intensive interventions in training settings acquired the skills during training and generalized these skills to the applied setting. Maintenance of these skills up to 6 months after training was demonstrated for most of the participants in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022466911404072">Lerman and colleagues’ (2008)</xref> study.</p>
<p>Although these studies evaluated different training packages and various target skills, they all included features that would likely enhance generalization from the training to the classroom or clinical setting. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022466911404072">Lerman et al. (2008)</xref> included common stimuli in the training setting and classroom setting and provided numerous practice opportunities with performance feedback in the training setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022466911404072">Moore and Fisher (2007)</xref> evaluated the effectiveness of several versions of video modeling and didactic training (reading a manual) on conducting a functional analysis. They found that video modeling that included a more complete set of exemplars was more effective in helping the participants acquire the skills than less complete video models and didactic training. All of the participants in this study demonstrated generalization of these skills to a clinical setting. This set of findings is in contrast to the studies on performance feedback cited above that found that training outside the classroom or clinic typically resulted in lack of generalization or maintenance of performance in the classroom. The studies that include intensive training suggest that with attention to features that may enhance generalization, training outside the classroom can result in generalization and maintenance of skills without daily or weekly performance feedback for most participants.</p>

<title>Fluency Training</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022466911404072">Stokes and Baer (1977)</xref> recommended many strategies for promoting generalization of skills to novel settings and maintenance of those skills over time. One of these strategies was to introduce the skills to natural contingencies of reinforcement. One facet of this strategy is to ensure that the individual is adequately proficient in the skill so that the skill is reinforced in the natural setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022466911404072">White et al., 1988</xref>). For example, if a behavior is performed too slowly or not often enough, it may not produce reinforcement in the natural setting, resulting in poor maintenance. One way to increase the likelihood that a behavior will generalize to a new setting and maintain over time is to ensure that it can be performed fluently (i.e., automatically).</p>
<p>Although training that produces highly accurate performance has been shown to be more effective than training that does not ensure accuracy, accuracy alone does not ensure that skills will be applied to new settings or maintained over time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022466911404072">DiGennaro, Martens, &amp; McIntyre, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022466911404072">Gilbertson, Witt, Singletary, &amp; VanDerHeyden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022466911404072">Hagermoser-Sanetti, Luiselli, &amp; Handler, 2007</xref>). Research conducted with children and adults suggests that additional practice beyond high accuracy (i.e., overlearning) is correlated with improved academic outcomes for students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022466911404072">Brophy &amp; Good, 1986</xref>) and typically enhances generalization of skills to new settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022466911404072">Bucklin, Dickinson, &amp; Brethower, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022466911404072">Evans &amp; Evans, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022466911404072">Johnson &amp; Layng, 1992</xref>) and maintenance of skills over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022466911404072">Binder, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022466911404072">Driskell, Willis, &amp; Cooper, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022466911404072">Ivarie, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022466911404072">Péladeau, Forget, &amp; Gagné, 2003</xref>). Fluency practice (practice in which skills are performed rapidly and smoothly) accomplishes overlearning efficiently and may further enhance performance. Improving the efficiency of training might make it more sustainable in schools.</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that group training outside the implementation setting may be effective for most participants when it includes attention to features that promote generalization and maintenance of skills. Adding fluency practice to group training of teaching skills outside the implementation setting may enhance generalization and maintenance of skills, while being cost-efficient, proactive, and sustainable in school settings. If fluency training of teaching skills were effective for most participants, performance feedback could be added during implementation to strategically target participants’ skills for which generalization or maintenance is problematic. The combination of effective up-front training and limited follow-up might strike a balance between the efficiency of group instruction and the power of individual coaching.</p>

<p>Briskly paced instruction with frequent opportunities for students to make active academic responses has been shown to increase students’ accuracy on academic tasks and on-task behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022466911404072">Carnine, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022466911404072">Darch &amp; Gersten, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022466911404072">Gilbertson, Duhon, Witt, &amp; Dufrene, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022466911404072">Sutherland, Alder, &amp; Gunter, 2003</xref>).

<title>Setting</title>
<p>This study was conducted in two public elementary schools in a rural school district in the West. The district served more than 14,000 students across 23 schools with approximately 30% of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch. The district’s student population was approximately 90.2% Caucasian, 7.6% Hispanic, 0.70% Asian, 0.60% African American, 0.40% Pacific Islander, 0.40% American Indian, and 0.10% unknown.</p>
<p>The district used a three-step process to place third, fourth, and fifth grade students into Tier II reading groups prior to this study. Three times per year, all students were administered the benchmark screenings from the <italic>Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills</italic> (DIBELS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022466911404072">Good &amp; Kaminski, 2002</xref>). If they scored below a threshold (“some risk” or “at risk”) and displayed other difficulties in reading (e.g., low scores on the state reading test or difficulties observed by classroom teachers), an individualized literacy plan was developed. For most students, this plan included Tier II intervention with <italic>Corrective Reading: Decoding</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022466911404072">Engelmann et al., 1999</xref>) as the primary intervention.</p>
<sec id="section11-0022466911404072">
<title>Reading instruction</title>
<p>Paraprofessionals and their students were observed in their classrooms during group instruction. In School 1, eight groups of three to five students participated in reading instruction at the same time in a single room. Each group sat at a small table with chairs, separated from other groups by eight-foot-tall dividers. In School 2, five groups of three to five students participated in reading instruction at the same time, separated from other groups by book shelves about four feet tall. In another classroom, three groups of students received instruction in language arts at the same time, separated by eight-foot-tall dividers.</p>

<p>Paraprofessionals were nominated for participation by a district-level facilitator. Paraprofessionals were included in the study if they (a) taught 5 days per week, (b) were available before or after school for training, and (c) demonstrated a need for training by showing low implementation rates of the reading curriculum in at least two of the following areas during informal and baseline observations:</p>
<list id="list1-0022466911404072" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Accurate presentation rate—10 or fewer presentations per minute</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Error correction accuracy—70% or fewer correct steps of correction procedure</p></list-item></list>
<p>Three paraprofessionals had 5 years of experience as paraprofessionals, one had 3 years of experience, and one was at the end of her 1st year. One of the paraprofessionals with 5 years of experience had 7 additional years of experience as a teacher. They all had taught <italic>Corrective Reading: Decoding</italic> during their entire paraprofessional experience. One paraprofessional had a bachelor’s degree in elementary education, two had attended some college without completing a degree, and two had completed high school. All of the paraprofessionals received their initial training in <italic>Corrective Reading: Decoding</italic> from the school district either individually with a literacy facilitator or in a large group setting at the beginning of the school year (about 5 hours of training). This training included an overview of direct instruction reading curricula, modeling of signals, letter–sound pronunciations, and specific training in each curriculum. The specific program training included the rationale for the curriculum, overview of the curriculum components, and training in conducting placement testing. For <italic>Corrective Reading: Decoding</italic>, no instructional practice was provided in the initial training.</p>

<title>Students</title>
<p>We collected data on one student from each paraprofessional’s group. We initially selected potential students based on DIBELS oral reading fluency scores, choosing one or two students with lower scores than the others in their group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022466911404072">Table 1</xref>). We then observed the groups and confirmed our choices based on the students making more word reading errors and showing more off-task behavior than other students. One target student (Claire) was chosen based on lower word reading accuracy but did not have higher off-task behavior. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022466911404072">Table 1</xref> presents the relevant demographic information for the students.

<title>Trainer</title>
<p>The first author provided fluency training to paraprofessionals. The trainer had taught direct instruction reading curricula to a wide variety of students, including those with disabilities for 6 years, taught a university class on direct instruction reading and supervised university practicum students and paraprofessionals who were learning to implement direct instruction reading curricula.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0022466911404072">
<title>Materials: Reading Curriculum</title>
<p>Paraprofessionals implemented Level B1 and/or B2 of <italic>Corrective Reading: Decoding</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022466911404072">Engelmann et al., 1999</xref>) across the district. Each level of the curriculum consists of 65 lessons with scripts for teacher presentations, student reading books, and student workbooks for written work. These programs feature scripted lessons including carefully designed and sequenced activities on letter and word discrimination, common word endings, sounds for combinations of letters, reading connected text, and answering literal and inferential comprehension questions. Paraprofessionals modeled new responses, signaled for group unison responses, corrected errors, and provided praise for accurate reading and attending. Reading fluency was monitored weekly throughout the program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0022466911404072">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Observers coded students’ word reading accuracy live daily during the word attack (i.e., single word reading) portion of the lesson (approximately 5 minutes), while video recording the session. For all other measures (paraprofessionals’ presentation rate, praise rate, and error correction accuracy and students’ on-task behavior), observers recorded data from video recordings of the sessions.</p>
<sec id="section19-0022466911404072">
<title>Paraprofessionals’ presentation rate</title>
<p>Presentation rate was a measure of the number of correct presentations of opportunities for students to respond. A presentation for group responding was counted correct if the paraprofessional used a clear cue, pause, and signal (clearly audible or visible) and appropriate wording of the instruction or direction (i.e., did not vary from the script in a way that changed what the students should do, omit an instruction for the students that could cause an error, or include spurious prompts such as additional scaffolding not included in the script). Individual turns and pauses when the paraprofessional answered students’ questions or explained the meaning of a word were not counted in the rate measure. Accurate presentations were counted as events during an observation period (e.g., 5 minutes), minus the time for individual turns, and presented as a rate of accurate presentations per minute. The target presentation rate for classroom teaching was 15 or more presentations per minute. This target was set based on recommendations by several authorities on direct instruction implementation (K. Engelmann, personal communication, January 6, 2009; R. Harris, personal communication, January 2, 2009; C. Schneider, personal communication, January 1, 2009).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0022466911404072">
<title>Paraprofessionals’ praise rate</title>
<p>Praise statements were defined as positive statements made by the paraprofessional and directed to one or more students contingent on a social, behavioral, or academic response. Praise was counted if it was general (“You did it!” or simply “Yes”) or specific (“Wow, you read those words just right!” or “Yes, the word is . . .”). Praise statements were counted as events during an observation period (e.g., 5 minutes) and presented as the rate of praise per minute (minus individual turns as described above). The target criterion for praise rate during classroom observations was four or more praise statements per minute (based on C. Schneider, personal communication, January 1, 2009).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0022466911404072">
<title>Paraprofessionals’ error correction accuracy</title>
<p>Accurate error corrections were defined as sequences in which a student made an academic error and the paraprofessional (a) stopped before presenting another item (stop), (b) said the correct answer just before asking students to read the word again (model), (c) asked the student or students to say the missed word (test), (d) asked the student or students to spell the missed word (spell), (e) asked the student or students to read the word again (test 2), and (f) provided opportunity for one or more responses on other items, then asked the student or students to read the missed word again (retest). Error correction accuracy was measured as the percentage of the six steps that were completed accurately for each student error that the paraprofessional attempted to correct. If observers noted an error that the paraprofessional did not correct, these data were coded separately so that error correction accuracy was not confounded with poor error detection.</p>
<p>The number of student errors varied greatly across sessions, and in some sessions there were very few. When reporting the data, each data point included at least five error correction attempts to reduce variability that would be introduced by data points based on few opportunities to correct errors. If the paraprofessional corrected fewer than five errors in a session, the data from this session were combined with the data from subsequent sessions until there were at least five error corrections. The data point was then calculated by adding the total number of correct steps and dividing that by the number of possible steps. However, data from sessions immediately before a phase change were not combined with data from sessions after the phase change, even if they included fewer than five error corrections. The target criterion for percentage accuracy on error corrections was 95% of error correction steps completed accurately (adapted from K. Engelmann, personal communication, January 6, 2009, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022466911404072">Lignugaris/Kraft &amp; Marchand-Martella, 1993</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0022466911404072">
<title>Students’ on-task behavior</title>
<p>The target student in each group was observed to estimate how much time he or she participated in academic tasks. This behavior was measured using whole interval recording with 10-second intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022466911404072">Kazdin, 1982</xref>) for approximately 5 minutes. We defined on-task behavior to capture behavior that was consistent with rules observed in the groups, such as “sitting tall,” answering on signal, and following directions. On-task behavior was defined as the student answering with an academic response less than 3 seconds after the teacher signaled for a response (i.e., minor signal errors because of early or late responses were not counted as off task, but nonresponses were) while the student was seated (i.e., bottom and/or legs in contact with the chair) with all four legs of the chair touching the floor in the instructional group. Behaviors such as making audible comments that did not pertain to the task, looking away from the task for 3 seconds or more, answering 3 seconds before or after the teacher’s signal, failing to follow a teacher direction within 3 seconds, leaving one’s chair (e.g., walking around, jumping), covering one’s mouth or face so that responses could not be heard, and hitting or audibly tapping the table or chair were not counted as on-task behavior. This measure was quantified as the percentage of whole intervals observed with on-task behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0022466911404072">
<title>Students’ word reading accuracy: percentage of first-time correct</title>
<p>Correct, incorrect, and no responses were recorded for each academic item the first time it was presented during that day’s session. When the teacher modeled a word, another student answered before the teacher presented a word, or the student’s mouth was not visible to the observers, the observers did not code the answer for accuracy. <italic>Correct responses</italic> were counted as answers that matched the teacher’s presentation book. <italic>Incorrect responses</italic> were recorded if the response was different than in the teacher’s presentation book, even if the student self-corrected after giving an incorrect response. <italic>No responses</italic> were counted if the student did not respond within 1 second of the teacher’s signal. Percentage of first-time correct was quantified as the number of correct responses divided by the total number of first-time responses (correct, incorrect, and no response).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0022466911404072">
<title>Reliability of dependent measures</title>
<p>At least 30% of observations across all phases were independently coded by a second observer. For each measure based on event recording (i.e., presentation rate and praise rate), proportional agreement was determined for each 10-second interval by dividing the smaller number of observations by the larger number of observations. Proportional agreement for the session was then calculated by averaging the agreements across intervals. For the other measures, percentage of exact agreement on each component (i.e., steps in error corrections, intervals of on-task behavior, or corrects for word-reading accuracy) was used. Percentage agreement was calculated as agreements divided by agreements plus disagreements.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0022466911404072">
<title>Design and Procedure</title>
<p>We used a multiple baseline across participants design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022466911404072">Kazdin, 1982</xref>) to evaluate the research questions in this study. In baseline phases, we observed the paraprofessionals and students in their classrooms without changes in existing procedures. When baseline data showed a stable or downward trend in presentation rate and praise rate for most participants, one participant began the fluency training phase. In one case, two paraprofessionals at one site started fluency training simultaneously because of staff scheduling constraints. Fluency training continued for five sessions. After fluency training ended, maintenance observations began. Maintenance observations continued until a participant’s presentation and/or praise rate decreased below the target criterion for 2 or 3 days with a downward or flat trend. Individualized performance feedback sessions were provided as needed, and these results are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022466911404072">O’Keeffe, 2009</xref>). Across legs of the multiple baseline, we attempted to introduce fluency training in the later legs after an effect had been seen in a previous leg and while the later baselines were flat or decreasing, but time constraints resulted in the introduction of fluency training on at least one occasion when a participant’s praise rate had increased at baseline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0022466911404072">
<title>Independent Variable: Paraprofessional Fluency Training</title>
<p>The trainer and research assistant conducted fluency training with small groups (9–13) of paraprofessionals and literacy facilitators 1 hour daily for 5 days. Skills included presentations, praise, and error corrections. We conducted daily classroom observations concurrently with this training. During fluency training, the trainer presented the rationale for the skill to be taught, modeled the skill, provided practice in role-playing situations with simplified scripts and focusing on one skill at a time, and provided positive and corrective verbal feedback. For example, when training on presentation rate was presented, the trainer first described the rationale for increasing accurate presentations (i.e., increases opportunities to respond and student on-task behavior, decreases student errors). The trainer demonstrated presentation skills, such as focusing students on an item, providing adequate think time, and providing a clear signal for students to respond. During this presentation, two or three paraprofessionals acted as students and made errors as indicated in the practice materials while the other participants observed. The trainer also presented nonexamples of presentation skills to help participants discriminate the target skills. After these demonstrations, the paraprofessionals divided into groups of three to five individuals, practiced accurate presentations, and received feedback from peers and the trainers. At the end of this practice time, paraprofessionals set a timer and practiced presenting items quickly, while a peer counted the number of accurate presentations in 2 minutes. Paraprofessionals practiced the skills to a fluency goal that was set about 20% higher than what was required in the classroom to increase the likelihood that the skills would generalize to the classroom. The trainer pointed out the goal of this training was not necessarily to present all items very fast but to be able to adjust one’s presentation rate to meet students’ needs (i.e., slow down and speed up depending on students’ responses). The paraprofessionals graphed their performance after each round of fluency practice. The trainer and research assistant gave positive and corrective feedback and answered questions.</p>
<p>Training sessions ended with a training probe. In all training probes, we provided paraprofessionals with a <italic>Corrective Decoding</italic> script from the lesson that they had most recently taught. Paraprofessionals were asked to teach as they would teach in class. Other paraprofessionals acted as students, with word lists indicating where to make errors (to provide opportunities for error corrections). Data were recorded for 2 minutes using the same criteria as listed above.</p>

<title>Interobserver Agreement</title>
<p>Interobserver agreement was assessed for 32% of sessions for presentation rate, praise rate, and error corrections, 34% of sessions for student on-task behavior, and 47% of sessions for student reading accuracy. Proportional agreement averaged 93.04% for presentation rate (range = 76.36–100.00) and 93.62% for praise rate (range = 78.47–100.00). The mean exact agreement for error correction steps was 95.99% (range = 83.33–100.00), 87.62% (range = 41.67–100.00) for student on-task behavior, 90.07% (range = 64.58–100.00) for student reading accuracy.</p>

<title>Treatment Fidelity: Fluency Training</title>
<p>The research assistant assessed treatment fidelity during 73% of fluency training sessions. The trainer completed 88% of the steps during these sessions, including three sessions when one paraprofessional could not complete the training probe because of illness. When those sessions were removed from the calculation, treatment fidelity reached an average of 95%. If a step was missed (typically intentionally skipped because of time constraints), the trainer completed that step during the next training session. Interobserver agreement was assessed on 73% of fidelity sessions (i.e., 53% of all fluency training sessions); it averaged 99%.</p>

The mean presentation rate was 7.97 for Ms. Allen, 0.35 for Ms. Dean, and 0.03 for Ms. Jones. Ms. Lewis presented a mean of 12.11 items correctly per minute during baseline, with a flat slope and high variability (range = 6.13–18.25) near the target criterion line.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fluency training on paraprofessionals’ presentation rate, praise rate, and error correction accuracy within an RTI system. A secondary purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of this fluency training on the students’ on-task and word reading accuracy. In general, paraprofessionals increased their praise rates and error correction accuracy with fluency training. For paraprofessionals with low baseline presentation rates, training resulted in higher rates of accurate presentations. For three students, on-task behavior increased in level (Luke and Todd) or decreased in variability (Claire) during paraprofessionals’ fluency training. Student reading accuracy remained relatively high throughout the study for most students, showing little effect of the training.</p>
<p>Conclusions from this study are tempered by the limited experimental control demonstrated for paraprofessionals’ presentation rates because not all paraprofessionals had low presentation rates during baseline and Ms. Allen’s baseline rates increased over time. Although all paraprofessionals improved their skills in providing reading support for these students, only Ms. Tate maintained all skills after fluency training was completed, avoiding the need for performance feedback. Ms. Tate presented items correctly at a high rate during baseline (typically above the classroom criterion), which may have helped her acquire the other skills more quickly and maintain them after fluency training ended. Also, she was the only paraprofessional to end the study with all skills above the classroom criterion on 3 consecutive days. Future research with larger groups may determine whether mastery of certain prerequisite skills prior to the study enables some paraprofessionals to benefit differentially from this type of training. If so, researchers could improve this training to better meet the needs of individuals with lower prerequisite skills. Also, resources might be allotted to provide group training to all, with the awareness that some may need more individualized follow-up training.</p>
<p>Paraprofessionals’ prior experience may interact with systematic training in instructional skills. Paraprofessionals with extensive experience may have long histories of practicing skills that are incompatible with those being trained. These paraprofessionals may require more or qualitatively different training to achieve accuracy, generalization, and maintenance. On the other side of the continuum, paraprofessionals with little experience and weak prerequisite skills may also respond differently to training. Future research could explore interactions between prior teaching experience and training to help guide choices about the nature, intensity, and extent of paraprofessional training.</p>
<p>Programs with different instructional characteristics may differ in training requirements. The <italic>Corrective Reading</italic> program used in this research is relatively complex, highly specified by scripts, and demanding of precise teaching behaviors. The results of this study may not generalize to reading programs with more or less complexity or to programs that are not scripted. When paraprofessionals use reading curriculum with less explicit instructions than that provided in <italic>Corrective Reading</italic>, they may require different kinds of training. The teaching skills required in teaching <italic>Corrective Reading</italic> are fairly complex, so we would anticipate that the effects of this training may generalize to less complex programs, to other scripted programs, and to other direct instruction programs.</p>
<p>Students’ on-task behaviors and first-time word reading accuracy were not substantially affected by the paraprofessionals’ changes in instructional delivery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022466911404072">Yoon and colleagues (2007)</xref> found that studies in which teachers received professional development for at least 14 hours showed positive effects on student outcomes. In this study, 5 hours of fluency training in instructional skills was provided for paraprofessionals. The training may not have been sufficiently extensive to change paraprofessionals’ skills in ways that would result in improved student outcomes. The feature of fluency practice would be expected to increase the amount of practice achieved per hour of training, so a simple comparison of hours of training may not be easily interpreted. Reading accuracy remained relatively high across the study for most students. This high accuracy in spite of relatively low instructional skills in baseline suggests that students may have been placed low in the program given their skills. If this was the case, their performance may have been less affected by factors such as presentation and praise rate. Student on-task behavior also appeared to be relatively insensitive to the changes in instructional delivery seen in this study. Future research could explore the features of the independent variable and measures that promote changes in important student behaviors such as word reading accuracy and on-task behavior.</p>
<p>Fluency training included multiple components such as rationale for specific behaviors, modeling, accuracy practice, fluency practice, training probes, and feedback on training performance. In addition, multiple skills were taught during the training. We do not know which components of the training were effective or ineffective. Future research would be needed to compare components and composites to determine the most effective and efficient delivery of this type of training. Also, the results suggest that although the paraprofessionals made some improvements, most paraprofessionals did not meet the criterion of 3 consecutive days with presentation and praise rates above the classroom criteria before training ended. Better generalization and maintenance of skills may have occurred with more hours of this type of training (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022466911404072">Lerman et al., 2008</xref>), a wider range of examples in modeling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022466911404072">Moore &amp; Fisher, 2007</xref>), or training to some mastery criterion (although the appropriate criterion would need to be determined as well). These aspects of the training warrant more research.</p>
<p>Finding efficient and effective means for promoting accurate delivery of research-based instruction is critical to ensuring that RTI is an effective system for intervening with students at risk for academic failure and identifying students with learning disabilities. The results of this study suggest that fluency training for paraprofessionals is a potential means to increase the efficacy and efficiency of professional development. Five hours of training resulted in increased praise and error correction accuracy. However, effects on students were more subtle or unclear. Future research could determine if more training or changes in measurement methods could enhance the effects or ability to detect effects. Administrators who would be responsible for continuing the use of this training in the future rated the feasibility highly. In addition, participants rated the training as acceptable and useful to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022466911404072">O’Keeffe, 2009</xref>). This study suggests a practical approach to improving professional development for paraprofessionals working with students at risk for reading disabilities within an RTI system.</p>
