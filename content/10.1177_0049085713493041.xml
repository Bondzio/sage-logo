<abstract>
<p>Corporate hospitals are becoming a significant presence within the ‘health care’ industry in India. There is strong advocacy and promotion by the industry, and the government, of the idea that health care infrastructure should not just be viewed as a social good but also as a viable economic venture with productivity. Yet, the discourse on privatisation, on the public–private divide in health systems does not pay attention to the spread of corporate sector activities and corporate financing in health care; to the increasing commercialisation of health services. This brief note highlights some recent trends and features of the hospitals sector of the ‘health care industry’ in India. There is a need to document and analyse the practices and behaviour of the hospital industry, and examine the impact of these changes for the public health systems, for policy and planning in public health, from a critical public health perspective.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>…I believe that a detailed history of a variety of aspects of the (pharmaceutical) industry will do something to add to the understanding of an industry which enters the lives of most of us in a uniquely powerful way. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0049085713493041">Liebenau, 1987</xref>: viii)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Liebenau (1987), in his treatise of the pharmaceutical industry, drew attention to the lack of studies of this industry despite its importance to modern medicine and the vital need to do so. This study detailed the interaction of science, technology and commerce, by examining relationships among industrialists, scientists, doctors and patients in the evolution and growth of the pharmaceutical industry. The objective in prefacing this article with these lines is to similarly draw attention to the emerging ‘health care’ industry in India, a sector that ‘enters the lives of most of us in a uniquely powerful way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0049085713493041">Liebenau, 1987</xref>); yet is not getting the critical attention it should.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need to document and analyse the transformations in the private health care sector over the past two decades and the implications of such changes for the overall health care system. The discourse on privatisation, on the public–private divide in health systems does not pay attention to the interactions of medical care and commerce, to the spread of corporate sector activities and corporate financing in health care; to the extent and pattern of commercialisation of health services; and to the interactions of the public and the private in this process. In other words, to that component where there is production of health services as a commercial activity and for purposes of profit. Corporate medical care providers are present not only in the major metropolitan cities, but there are also regional networks, and they are providing a range of medical services, including certain kinds of education and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049085713493041">Chakravarthi, 2010</xref>: 3). They are becoming a significant presence within the health care system. This brief note highlights some recent trends and features of the hospitals sector of the ‘health care industry’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0049085713493041">1</xref></sup> in India.</p>

<sec id="section2-0049085713493041">
<title>Health Care as ‘a Big Business Opportunity’ and an Engine of Growth</title>
<p>According to the President and CEO, GE Healthcare India, ‘India is the first country to have a large number of multinational health care providers. There are seven–eight very active MNCs. It opens a whole host of opportunities for us. I see the health care sector as one of the biggest business opportunities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049085713493041">Bose, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Increasingly over the past decade, there is strong advocacy and promotion by the industry of the idea that ‘Health care infrastructure should not just be viewed as a social good but also as a viable economic venture with productivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0049085713493041">FICCI, 2008</xref>). The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) projects health care sector as one with immense importance for the national economy, due to its rising contribution to GDP and the potential to be an engine of growth for the nation as it can create ‘70 to 80 million jobs in the next 10 years…’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049085713493041">Bakshi et al., 2010</xref>). The CII National Healthcare Division, comprising hospitals, diagnostic centres, and medical equipment companies, regularly organises the India Health Summit since 2002 to promote private investment in the health care sector and lobby for concessions and favourable policies (<uri>http://www.cii.in/CouncilsandCommittees-Healthcare</uri>).</p>
<p>One of the demands of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) Health Services Division is that the government should attract private health care investment to supplement the public funding deficit in health care allocations, by giving various fiscal and non-fiscal incentives. Some of the proposals of the industry are as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0049085713493041">FICCI, 2008</xref>):
<list id="list1-0049085713493041" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Recognise the role of private health care providers in creating affordable, accessible and quality health care infrastructure through sensitisation of the decision makers by providing appropriate information through dialogue.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Facilitate Public–Private Partnership (PPP) projects for building health infrastructure through healthy dialogue between the public and the private sector and extensive stakeholder consultation by involving the civil society organisations, NGOs and the Government to leverage each other’s strengths.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Target 2 beds per thousand, by the year 2025.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The private sector should be encouraged and incentivised to make the required amount of investment particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and in those states lagging behind in the development of the health sector.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Policy changes in line with the current market realities related to medical education—allow private players to enter medical education and allow a financially viable and realistic fee structure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Medical education should be made transparent and freed from regulations for quick expansion. Non-viable norms like each medical college owning a 500-bed hospital should be done away with and be replaced by utilising the 300-bed District hospitals for teaching purposes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The non-viable concept of free treatment by the private sector in lieu of incentives should be replaced with third-party payment by the government or insurance system.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>PPPs are being viewed as having potential to create ‘an enormous market with a reliable, multi-year revenue stream for private investors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049085713493041">CII, 2011</xref>). In fact the industry views the scenario thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>The first wave of healthcare provision in India was the government run healthcare network. The influx of the private players defined the second wave. Now a discerning and interconnected nation demands a new incarnation: Healthcare 3.0, which will transform the ground rules of healthcare…Healthcare 3.0 will ordain that revenues are linked to patient satisfaction…Seamless public-private partnerships will be the backbone of the new dispensation, emerging as fundamental to growth. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049085713493041">Bakshi et al., 2010</xref>: v)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section3-0049085713493041">
<title>Infusion of Private Equity</title>
<p>The health care industry is reported to be ‘flush with private equity (PE) funds’. According to business reports, there has been an increase of PE funding in health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049085713493041">Dutta, 2008</xref>). Health care companies are reported to prefer PE fund over raising capital through public offers or debt. The investment of PE funds was reported to be taking place not just for established hospital chains in urban areas but also for hospitals in Tier II and Tier III cities, rural and semi-urban areas, diagnostic centres and medical equipment. For instance, New York–based Acumen Fund and Hindustan Latex Ltd (HLL, a government enterprise) had formed a joint venture (JV) called Life Spring Hospitals, which was creating a chain of small hospitals (20–25 beds), in UP to provide maternal and child health care services for the lower middle income group in semi-urban areas. ICICI Venture, which floated I-Ven Medicare in mid-2007, had invested in not-so-renowned names in health care. It invested $36 million in Sahyadri Hospital, Pune; $24 million in Vikram Hospital, Mysore; $16.25 million in Medica Synergy, Kolkata; and $10.25 million in RG Stone, New Delhi. PE firms were also reported to be investing in independent diagnostic centres. For example, ICICI Venture had invested ₹35 crore in Metropolis Health Services in 2006. Venture Capital firm Sequoia Capital India had invested $10 million in Dr Lal PathLabs.</p>

<sec id="section4-0049085713493041">
<title>Role of the International Finance Corporation</title>
<p>The International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank group has also been providing loans for the expansion of the private providers into new markets. At the IFC’s International Private Health Conference in May 2011 it was stated by one IFC functionary that ‘Health care has become a major global industry, growing faster than GDP in most countries…as the world recovers from the international financial crisis, the expansion of the private health sector continues rapidly across emerging markets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0049085713493041">IFC, 2011a</xref>). IFC is the world’s largest multilateral investor in the private health care sector in emerging markets. As of May 2009, it had invested about $200 million in the private health care sector in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0049085713493041">IFC, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0049085713493041">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since 2002, IFC has extended loans to Apollo twice, as well as to other hospitals such as Max, Rockland, Artemis and Duncan-Gleneagles (in 1997) (from <uri>www.ifc.org</uri>). In June 2009, IFC provided loans amounting to $50 million to Apollo Hospitals Enterprises Limited (AHEL) to expand its Apollo Reach network, specifically to set up smaller hospitals in the next three years in semi-urban and rural areas, in Tier II cities, to provide ‘affordable health care’ to low-income populations in these areas, using cross-subsidisation between ‘high-income and low-income consumers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0049085713493041">IFC, 2009</xref>). IFC is promoting this activity of AHEL as an ‘innovative and inclusive business model’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0049085713493041">3</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-0049085713493041">
<title>The Apollo Reach ‘Business Model’: ‘Affordable Corporate Care for Rural and Semi-urban Areas’</title>
<p>This section looks briefly at the activities of AHEL as a representative corporate entity in the health care sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049085713493041">Chakravarthi, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As of March 2011, Apollo had 54 hospitals with a capacity of over 8,700 beds, across 22 cities of Ahmedabad, Aragonda, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar, Bilaspur, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Indore, Kakinada, Karimnagar, Karur, Kolkata, Ludhiana, Madurai, Mysore, Noida, Pune, Raichur, Ranchi, Ranipet and Vishakapatnam; and one each in Dhaka and Mauritius. In the past, it primarily focussed on the southern region and expanded to other markets only through partnerships/joint ventures. It was now planning to add 2,200 beds by 2014, in different regions in the following manner: Expansion in existing projects in Hyderabad, Chennai and Bilaspur; Reach hospitals in Ayanambakkam, Nasik, Karaikudi, Nellore and Trichy; super specialty hospitals in Vizag, Belapur, Mumbai, Secunderabad and Hyderguda. In addition, through joint ventures and associates in Thane (super specialty), Bangalore (expansion), and New Delhi (expansion), to take the bed strength to 438 at a cost of ₹246 crores. AHEL is also reported to be setting up paediatric hospitals, four in India and one in Nigeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049085713493041">IBEF, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the year ending March 2011, the gross revenue of the company had increased to ₹2,353.3 crores, registering a growth of 27 per cent over the previous year. The profit after tax for the year increased by 20 per cent to ₹181.7 crores, compared to ₹152 crores in the previous year. Total number of employees for the group increased from 26,659 in March 2010 to 30,640 as of March 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049085713493041">AHEL, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The Apollo Group describes itself as an ‘integrated health care organisation’ with owned and managed tertiary care hospitals, diagnostic clinics, dispensing pharmacies and neighbourhood primary care clinics providing clinical and diagnostic services. Apollo Health and Lifestyle (AHLL), founded in 2002, has been establishing a large network of The Apollo Clinics across the country with over 50 clinics operational all over India. As a part of the Apollo group’s objective to expand its operations, a number of similar clinics will be set up overseas as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049085713493041">AHEL, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The lack of hospitals and medical facilities outside metropolitan cities and urban centres, and the availability of government health insurance programmes such as Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), Aarogyasri, etc., is being exploited by corporate hospitals such as Apollo to set up what has been termed as REACH Hospitals. As part of the plan to expand and penetrate different, underserved markets, Apollo Reach hospitals are being set up since 2008 in Tier II and Tier III cities, with 100–200 beds, in the name of taking ‘high-quality health care closer to the masses so that patients in these locations do not have to travel to Tier I cities for comprehensive medical treatments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049085713493041">AHEL, 2011</xref>). As of 2011, such hospitals had already been set up in places like Bhubaneswar, Kakinada, Karimnagar, Karaikudi, Karur and other places. Low cost is being projected as a key feature of Apollo Reach hospitals. Treatments in the Apollo Reach model are reported to cost 20–30 per cent less than at other hospitals in the Apollo network and other major hospitals. Each Apollo Reach hospital is reported to have 150 beds, 40 intensive care unit beds, and five operation theatres. The range of services provided covers cardiac, oncology, radiology, neurosurgery and other specialisations; video endoscopy, blood bank, check-up, radiology, complete lab, dental, ear, nose and throat (ENT), and eye care services.</p>
<p>To address the problem of getting medical personnel for semi-urban and rural areas, Apollo is reported to be offering ‘a fast-track career which gives doctors more responsibility and faster promotions to their hospitals in urban areas if they work for a few years in a Reach hospital’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0049085713493041">IFC, 2011b</xref>). Apollo Reach hospitals are reported to be treating both low and high-income patients. Using the higher fees paid by more affluent patients helps make the hospitals profitable for the parent company as well as using cross-subsidisation between high-income and low-income consumers. The RSBY is another source of revenue for these hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0049085713493041">IFC, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, in May 2012 the Bangalore-based Narayana Hruyadalaya reported plans of investing nearly ₹5,000 crore on setting up a chain of 100 low-cost specialty hospitals and at least three more health cities in the country. These hospitals were to come up in cities with a population of between 5 and 10 lakhs. Nine such projects were to be made operational over the next year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0049085713493041">Pandit, 2012</xref>). The first such hospital was being built in Mysore. Apart from its Health City in Bangalore, this group had set up a health city in Ahmedabad, which was to also have a medical college, nursing and paramedical training institutions. Two more ‘health cities’ were to be set up in Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, respectively.</p>

<sec id="section6-0049085713493041">
<title>Personal Loans for Hospitalisation Costs</title>
<p>Recently, the Tata Group announced that it would fund hospital costs for needy patients, through its financial company Tata Capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0049085713493041">Unnikrishnan, 2010</xref>). Tata Capital, which currently offers housing finance, personal loans and other retail lending, will finance patients for non-emergency treatments, including knee replacements, dental care, maternity care and orthopaedic surgery at concessional rates. The lending rate will be in the range of 5 to 11 per cent, according to ‘the nature of treatment and the credit profile of the patient’. The company plans to mainly target middle and lower middle class patients who need treatment, but are unable to afford it immediately due to financial constraints.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0049085713493041">
<title>Favourable Policy Environment</title>
<p>In this era of neoliberal policies, it is not just the industry that is projecting ‘growth’ in the health care markets and ‘exploiting the huge opportunities’. The Indian government is also promoting India as a ‘favourable destination for investment in health care’, which is an area for potential growth. According to the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), ‘India is one of the world’s most lucrative health care markets and is expanding rapidly...’ IBEF engaged market research company Ernst &amp; Young to prepare a report on the health care sector. Citing business reports, IBEF states that huge private sector investments will significantly contribute to the development of the hospital industry, comprising around 80 per cent of the total market (<uri>www.ibef.org</uri>). Much of this growth is attributed to increase in number of hospitals in Tier II and Tier III cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0049085713493041">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>There has always been a large private sector in health care in India, comprising largely individual practitioners, charitable hospitals, and doctor-owned nursing homes. Health sector reforms of the 1990s specifically promoted the role of the private sector as a partner and a remedy for all the problems of the public sector. However, no regulations were instituted. Accordingly, there has been an unregulated growth of institutions in the private sector. There is further shift of late—from involving private sector through PPPs to more direct involvement as providers by bringing in market mechanisms, whereby the government ‘purchases’ medical care services from multiple providers in regional networks. The High Level Expert Group (HLEG) on Universal Health Coverage for India, constituted by the Planning Commission in October 2010, while suggesting that general taxation should be the principal source of health care financing and no fees of any kind for medical care services, recommended ‘purchase’ of all health care services on a competing basis from contracted-in private providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0049085713493041">GoI, 2011</xref>). According to the HLEG, the government will be the guarantor and enabler, but not necessarily the only provider of health care and related services.</p>
<p>The health chapter in the 12th Five-year Plan thus proposes a ‘new strategy’ as part of a longer term reform of the system over the next decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049085713493041">GoI, 2012</xref>). According to this Plan, the health system will continue to have a mix of public and private service providers and the two will need to coordinate for delivery of a continuum of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049085713493041">GoI, 2012</xref>: Sec. 20.19). That given the reality of public–private providers, they can be a network of public and private providers to attain universal coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049085713493041">GoI, 2012</xref>: Sec. 20.42, 20.43, 20.44). It is suggested that various options of financing and organisation should be explored by states and they be encouraged and financed to run one to three pilots to test out the models. ‘The pilots could explore different models for providing universal access to an Essential Health Package (EHP) including…a combination of public and private facility networks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049085713493041">GoI, 2012</xref>: Sec. 20.48). ‘In areas where both public and private contracted in providers co-exist, patients shall have a choice in selecting their provider. Networks of such integrated facilities at different levels will be encouraged to provide a continuum of care…’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049085713493041">GoI, 2012</xref>: Sec. 20.46). There is also the proposal of granting financial and administrative autonomy to public facilities, encouraging them to raise their own resources, and more direct privatisation measures to set up facilities to provide medical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049085713493041">GoI, 2012</xref>: Sec. 20.57, 20.58).</p>
<p>Thus, we see that instead of asking why the government health system is so weak and ineffective, and why there is such a vast private sector, the Planning Commission serves it as a fait accompli and proposes to ‘strengthen’ the public health system for universal health coverage by accommodation of the private sector within the health system rather than explore other options. While the induction of the private sector into the health care system has thus been legitimised, yet these documents remain silent on the diverse nature of the private providers, the growing presence and influence of corporate providers, on the experiences of other countries with corporate presence, and on how exactly they are going to be regulated.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that the corporate sector and the policy-makers are speaking in the same language.</p>

<sec id="section8-0049085713493041">
<title>Issues and Concerns</title>
<p>In his study of the pharmaceutical industry, Liebenau remarks that ‘it was important to be able to show what the characteristics of the industry are and therefore, why certain behaviours might be expected’. He points out that one should not be shocked by the fact that the industry indulged in market manipulation, price fixing, dumping, and other kinds of unethical medical and business practices; it has not acted differently from other industries operating in similar markets. That was the behaviour of large and powerful industries, especially those which operate internationally and wield professional, economic and political power. The significant difference, according to him, is that ‘this industry associates itself with the high standards of the healing arts…they claimed to have high standards and a moralistic stance higher than other industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0049085713493041">Liebenau, 1987</xref>: vii–viii).</p>
<p>Such an analysis of the pharmaceutical industry holds great relevance today for the ‘health care industry’. In India, currently we see that the ‘the business of medicine has been rendered a highly desirable arena for the presence of capitalist institutions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0049085713493041">McKinlay, 1978</xref>). Analysing the phenomenon of entry of financial and industrial capital in medicine and health care in the US, McKinlay observed that
<disp-quote>
<p>the industrial and financial capital institutions in medical care impose the same logic (profitability through expansion) on this field that they have been doing in other sectors of the economy since around the turn of the twentieth century. Their presence has ramifications at all levels. Among other things, it fosters fetishization of illness through an increased and intensified sales effort. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0049085713493041">McKinlay, 1978</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A significant aspect of this growth of the ‘health care industry’ in India is the spread of the activities of the corporate hospitals to semi-urban and rural areas, a process which is being facilitated through policy measures such as public–private partnerships, as well as by powerful institutions such as the International Finance Corporation and development partners. We find rapid developments occurring in the private medical care sector, such as the expansion to smaller towns and rural areas, forming referral networks, setting up primary care clinics for out-patient needs and consultations, attracting doctors towards such arrangements, getting into PPPs through insurance schemes, financing individuals for hospitalisation, etc.</p>
<p>The health care industry, specifically the hospital sector within this health care industry, is adopting a moralistic stance and talks of working towards universal, affordable and high quality health care to the millions of Indians who are deprived of such services. This, the industry insiders say, is possible through business and market mechanisms. Plans are being made along these lines for expansion, penetrating new markets, targeting new segments, training and attracting medical professionals, etc. However, the actual goals of the industry, clearly those of commerce, profits and expansions, bear no relation to these moral proclamations of service provision and are, in reality, a total antithesis of the vision and provision of health care as a public good and public service to be provided through a comprehensive, universal, health care system. Is this the path towards a health system for ‘universal health care’ or towards the entrenchment of a ‘health care industry’? Is it possible to align the activities of such an industry to meet the objectives of comprehensive, universal, equitable health care?</p>
<p>In addressing and resolving such questions, it is useful to make a distinction between ‘health care’ and ‘medical care’, even though there is an apparent overlap between the two; and even though much of the discourse on health care and health systems is actually about provision of medical care services. It is an accepted fact that health is more than absence of illness. Health care is that part of a system which deals with prevention of illness, protection from illness and promotion of health in populations. Health care is about paying attention to availability of sufficient food, clean water, shelter, and hygienic living and working conditions, and clean environments, in short to all aspects conducive to maintaining a healthy life. Provision of medical care to sick individuals is essential as a preventive measure for spread of infectious diseases as well for provision of cure and relief from pain and support to disabled and chronically ill individuals. However, provision of timely medical care although necessary and critical, is only a part of a larger health care system whose objectives are to make provisions to prevent illnesses and diseases in a population and keep people healthy. So far, many countries across the world, including India, have developed health care and medical care systems in a highly planned and organised way, as a welfare measure and a matter of right of citizens. Provision of medical care has been viewed and undertaken as a part of the larger health policy and planning process, and has largely been provided through non-profit mechanisms. In this framework, hospitals are responsible for various kinds of preventive and promotive activities, along with curative work.</p>
<p>However, the rising ‘health care industry’ is only about providing medical care of various kinds as a business venture—from consultations to diagnosis to therapy and treatment, and screening for early detection of certain illnesses. In this light, it should be viewed and treated as a service sector, as the hospitals sector of the economy, and not be conflated with health care and health care systems. However, given the importance of medical care for public health systems, and given the experiences of commercialisation of medical care in countries such as the USA, the behaviour and activities of such a ‘health care industry’ in India should be a subject of concern for public health, and cannot be left to the industry, management and business experts. The impact of these changes for public health systems, for policy and planning, and research in public health needs to be documented and analysed from a critical public health perspective. There is substantial documentation and experiences to show that corporations come with vast resources and power to influence pricing of services and nature of technologies used, to advertise and package and sell services, create and sell new demands, and finally to influence overall policy decisions.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need to document and analyse the practices and behaviour of the hospital industry and examine the effectiveness of such reform mechanisms to deliver on the promise of universal, affordable, quality health care; in short, to study the impact of these developments on the public health system. Some of the specific issues that need attention from a public health perspective are as follows: Is it possible to regulate size/capacity, and geographical spread of such a system? Is it possible to impose controls on costs of the services offered and on income maximisation (profits)? Should there be partnership with the corporate sector in the PPPs? Other issues of transparency and information sharing arise, as the corporate sector is completely secretive in the name of business interests. One needs to also look at impact on availability of doctors and nurses, on medical practice in general and ethical practice, in particular. Lastly, given the international political economy of health care and the kind of private equity inflow from foreign investors, could this become a medium for entry of foreign multinational health care companies and insurers into the Indian ‘market for health care’?</p>

The hospitals sector is reported to form the major segment of this industry; and hence the term health care industry is often used while talking about corporate and other big private hospitals. There is a tendency by the industry to include government health institutions as part of this ‘health care industry’.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0049085713493041"><label>2.</label><p>IFC promotes private sector investment through direct and indirect investment, extending loans, informing government policy, as well by providing support and technical assistance for private sector growth through its institutions. In 2003 IFC along with UK’s DFiD established DevCo to support IFC’s work to increase private sector participation in infrastructure. In addition to DFiD, other donors include the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Austrian Development Agency (ADA), and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA). The Public–Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) is another such fund set up by IFC with the same objectives, and is supported by DFiD, AusAID, USAID, World Bank, and bilateral donor agencies of Canada, and several European countries.</p></fn>
