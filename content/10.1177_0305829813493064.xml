<p>In the contemporary world, we find ourselves increasingly surrounded by prominent material forces: climate change-fuelled storms, a ubiquitous computational infrastructure, the rapid dispersion of viral epidemics, the renewed importance of the body, and the steady march of the sciences into the inner realms of subjectivity. Everywhere we look, the social world is intermingling with the material world in complex and diverse ways. The wager of the 2012 <italic>Millennium</italic> conference was that the discipline of International Relations could profitably contribute to and benefit from the rethinking of materiality in world politics, building on recent philosophical works.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0305829813493064">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question broached variously by each of the contributions to this special issue is: how does matter matter? That is to say, in what ways does a focus on materiality contribute to ethical considerations, to generating understanding, and to producing causal explanations? Whereas the most common approach in IR has been to see material things as forming an inert backdrop for the play of social forces, this issue seeks to foreground these elements.</p>
<p>In doing so, the materialist position is led to ask critical questions about rational actors, agency in a physical world, the role of affect in decision-making, the biopolitical shaping of bodies, the perils and promises of material technology, the resurgence of historical materialism, and the looming environmental catastrophe. A large number of critical writers in International Relations have been discussing these topics for some time, yet the common materialist basis to them has gone largely unacknowledged. The purpose of this issue is therefore, in part, to solidify this important shift and to push its critical edges further.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from a wide variety of disciplines – feminism, actor-network theory, sociology, and historical materialism – the contributions to this issue all provide important insights into how the practices of world politics are shaped and determined by material forces as well as social forces.</p>
<p>With the exciting set of contributions brought together here, we hope this issue will spark interest and open up new research paths for scholars of IR.</p>
