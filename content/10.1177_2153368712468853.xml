<p>With the heralded election of the first African American President, Barack Obama, headlines declare that we are now in a postracial society. Finally, despite hundreds of years of repressing African Americans, the United States has transcended race. The innate goodness of U.S. citizens has resolutely triumphed as the United States has inevitably manifested Martin Luther King’s dream of having people judged not by the color of their skin but by “the content of their character.”</p>
<p>In support of this triumphant conclusion, the mass media publishes study after study that finds that African Americans have substantially and significantly progressed. According to these studies, African American achievements have diminished the racial divide in education, employment, wages, home ownership, and in health. These well-documented achievements are prima fascie evidence that the racial barriers designed to oppress African Americans are being dismantled. African Americans are finally harvesting the fruits of their hard work. Indeed, there is now serious debate in this postracial United States that government policies should no longer target race but rather focus on class inequalities.</p>
<p>Into this foray steps Professor Becky Pettit a Professor of Sociology at the University of Washington. With surgical artistry, she calmly steps back from these headlines and asks whether the data truly support such promising conclusions of racial progress. And, her answer is “no.”</p>
<p>But, how could Professor Pettit make such a declaration when even the U.S. government has presented data that delineate across the board substantial African American gains? Professor Pettit points out that nearly all the research that reveals racial progress is based on data collected from surveys gathered from households, which, by definition, excludes those in prison. Two primary data sources often analyzed are the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey. Professor Pettit persuasively argues that these data sets overstate the progress that African American males have made because they do not include Black men who are currently incarcerated and are disproportionately the least skilled. In essence, excluding imprisoned African American men is the equivalent of deleting every student who scored below a 70 on an exam and then declaring that everyone passed!</p>
<p>As of 2009, over 800,000 African American males were held in custody in state or federal prison, or in local jails. And, although African American men are approximately 6% of the U.S. population, they account for over 42% of those incarcerated. Professor Pettit cites other disturbing statistics that demonstrate the degree to which the carceral state has deleteriously impacted African American men. For example, “Five percent of white and 28 percent of black men born between 1975 and 1979 spent at least a year in prison before reaching age thirty-five. The risks of spending time in prison for this birth cohort were significantly higher among high school dropouts: 28 percent of white and 68 percent of black dropouts had spent at least a year in prison by 2009” (p. 18). In fact, she states that “Spending time in prison has become more common than completing a four-year college degree or military service among young black men. And, young black, male high school dropouts are more likely to spend at least a year in prison than they are to get married” (p. 18).</p>
<p>The thrust of Professor Pettit’s analysis is how the mass incarceration of African American men has skewed the data that are the basis for declaring a postracial America. This is most demonstratively shown in Professor Pettit’s analysis of the rate of high school dropouts. “Among young black men, including inmates implies a nationwide high school dropout rate more than 40 percent higher than conventional estimates suggest and no improvement in the black-white gap in high school graduation rates since the early 1990s. In 2008, during what has become known as the “Great Recession,” Black male dropouts were <italic>more</italic> likely to be in prison or jail than to be employed” (emphasis in original; p. 102). She additionally finds that including incarcerated African American men attenuates the degree to which there is racial progress in relation to rates of employment, the Black–White wage gap, and the degree to which African American men vote. In the end, her clear-minded, succinctly written manuscript concludes that the acclaimed racial progress is more myth than reality.</p>
<p>This book is also notable because it examines how the mass incarceration of Black men destabilizes communities, has deleterious health consequences (the possible spread of communicable diseases [e.g., AIDS, Hepatitis C]), and its toxic effects on the families left behind. This must read book is a welcomed addition to the debate over racial progress and the toxic effects of the massive incarceration of African American men.</p>
