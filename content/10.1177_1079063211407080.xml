<abstract>
<p>Data from the Estimate of Risk of Adolescent Sexual Offense Recidivism (ERASOR; Worling &amp; Curwen) were collected for a sample of 191 adolescent males who had offended sexually. Adolescents were aged 12 to 19 years (<italic>M</italic> = 15.34; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.53) at the time of their participation in a comprehensive assessment. The ERASOR was completed by 1 of 22 clinicians immediately following each assessment. Forty-five adolescents were independently rated by pairs of clinicians, and significant interrater agreement was found for the ERASOR risk factors, the clinical judgment ratings (<italic>low, moderate</italic>, or <italic>high</italic>), and a total score. Recidivism data (criminal charges) were subsequently collected from three sources that spanned a follow-up period between 0.1 and 7.9 years (<italic>M</italic> = 3.66; <italic>SD</italic> = 2.08). Overall, 9.4% (18 of 191) of the adolescents were charged with a subsequent sexual offense over this time period. A shorter follow-up interval of up to 2.5 years (<italic>M</italic> = 1.4; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.71) was also examined. Recidivism data for the shorter follow-up interval were available for a subgroup of 70 adolescents, with a comparable recidivism rate of 8.6% (6 of 70). Clinical judgment ratings, the total score, and the sum of risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic> were significantly predictive of sexual reoffending for the short follow-up period. The total score and the sum of risk factors were predictive of sexual reoffending over the entire follow-up interval. These results add to the emerging research supporting the reliability and validity of structured risk assessment tools for adolescent sexual recidivism.</p>

<p>Adolescents who offend sexually are a heterogeneous population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1079063211407080">Worling, 2001</xref>), and they present with unique strengths, needs, and risks. Although it was once thought that most adolescents who offended sexually would be at a high risk of reoffending sexually, it has been demonstrated that most adolescents who have offended sexually will not be detected and charged for subsequent sexual offenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1079063211407080">Reitzel &amp; Carbonell, 2006</xref>)—even up to 20 years following detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211407080">Worling, Litteljohn, &amp; Bookalam, 2010</xref>). Of course, there are a number of adolescents who do, in fact, present an elevated risk of reoffending sexually, and it would be ideal to be able to identify those adolescents most at risk. Indeed, an estimate of the risk of a sexual reoffense would be very useful for a number of issues such as allocating valuable treatment resources, planning treatment intensity, outlining community supervision strategies, or timing family reunification efforts. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1079063211407080">Andrews and Bonta (1994)</xref>, therapeutic interventions for those involved with the criminal justice system should be provided to individuals who present the highest risk of reoffending, and treatment should be delivered so that dynamic risk factors are directly targeted.</p>
<p>Most of the research regarding sexual recidivism risk assessment is based on work with adult males who have offended sexually. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1079063211407080">Hanson and Morton-Bourgon (2009)</xref> recently conducted a meta-analysis of the accuracy of risk assessment tools with more than 45,000 predominantly adult males who had offended sexually. Most of the 118 investigations were based on retrospective file review, and the strongest predictive accuracy was found for actuarial scales (<italic>d</italic> = .67). An effect size of this magnitude corresponds to an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of approximately 0.68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211407080">Rice &amp; Harris, 2005</xref>). For those unfamiliar with AUC values, an AUC of 0.68 means that there is a 68% chance that a randomly selected recidivist will have a higher score on the test relative to a randomly selected nonrecidivist. There are several actuarial risk-assessment tools developed for adults who have sexually offended, and the Static-99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063211407080">Hanson &amp; Thornton, 2000</xref>) is the most widely used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211407080">McGrath, Cumming, Burchard, Zeoli, &amp; Ellerby, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1079063211407080">Hanson and Morton-Bourgon (2009)</xref> found that the mean predictive accuracy of the Static-99 was approximately equivalent to an AUC of 0.68.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211407080">McGrath et al. (2010)</xref> pointed out that research regarding the predictive validity of risk-assessment tools with adolescents who have offended sexually is still in the early stages. They noted that, in 2002, only about two fifths of programs in the United States for adolescents who offended sexually used one or more of the more popular risk-assessment tools. By 2009, however, approximately 80% of treatment programs were using one or more of following three risk-assessment tools: the Juvenile Sex Offender Assessment Protocol–II (J-SOAP-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063211407080">Prentky &amp; Righthand, 2003</xref>), the Estimate of Risk of Adolescent Sexual Offense Recidivism (ERASOR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063211407080">Worling &amp; Curwen, 2001</xref>), and the Juvenile Sexual Offense Recidivism Risk Assessment Tool (JSORRAT-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063211407080">Epperson, Ralston, Fowers, &amp; DeWitt, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211407080">McGrath et al. (2010)</xref> commented that this increase is accounted for by the dramatic increase in the use of the ERASOR and the J-SOAP-II. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211407080">McGrath et al. (2010)</xref>, the use of the ERASOR has increased by almost 150% between 2002 and 2009.</p>
<p>The ERASOR was designed as a structured checklist to guide professional judgment of the risk of a sexual reoffense for youth aged 12 to 18 years. The development of the ERASOR was outlined in our previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211407080">Worling, 2004</xref>) where we also provided preliminary psychometric data regarding reliability and validity. The ERASOR contains 25 risk factors: 9 static risk factors related to historical criminal sexual behaviors and 16 dynamic risk factors related to current sexual, familial, environmental, affective, and interpersonal functioning. The ERASOR is a single-scale checklist with 25 risk factors that fall under five categories: (a) sexual interests, attitudes, and behaviors, (b) historical sexual assaults, (c) psychosocial functioning, (d) family/environmental functioning, and (e) treatment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063211407080">Table 1</xref> for a list of ERASOR risk factors).</p>

<p>In their meta-analysis of the accuracy of risk assessment tools for sexual offense recidivism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1079063211407080">Hanson and Morton-Bourgon (2009)</xref> found that an ERASOR score (i.e., a simple tally of risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic>) was moderately predictive of sexual recidivism (approximate AUC of 0.66). This was based on a synthesis of the results from three investigations whereby students made ratings based on archival file data. Looking at the studies individually, two of the investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1079063211407080">McCoy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1079063211407080">Morton, 2003</xref>) found nonsignificant AUCs for an ERASOR total score, whereas the third author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1079063211407080">Skowron, 2004</xref>) found that the sum of ERASOR ratings rated as <italic>present</italic> was significantly predictive of sexual recidivism (AUC = 0.71; <italic>SE</italic> = 0.05). In a subsequent investigation with the ERASOR, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211407080">Viljoen, Elkovitch, Scalora, and Ullman (2009)</xref> conducted a retrospective investigation of the predictive accuracy of several risk-assessment tools with a sample of 193 adolescent males in residential treatment (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063211407080">Viljoen et al., 2008</xref>). Coding risk assessments using archival file data, and using a mean follow-up period of 7.24 years, they found that the clinical judgment rating (i.e., <italic>low, moderate</italic>, or <italic>high</italic>) from the ERASOR yielded the highest AUC (0.64) relative to the other tools. In a similar investigation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063211407080">Rajlic and Gretton (2010)</xref> examined ERASOR ratings made by graduate and undergraduate students using archival file material regarding 268 adolescents involved in a provincial treatment service. They found that, with a mean follow-up period of approximately 6.5 years, both the clinical judgment rating and the ERASOR total score were significantly predictive of sexual recidivism. Researchers have also found significant levels of interrater agreement for an ERASOR total score, the clinical judgment rating, and the majority of the individual risk factors on the ERASOR (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1079063211407080">Skowron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211407080">Viljoen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211407080">Worling, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the <italic>prospective</italic> validity of the ERASOR. Most of the existing research regarding the validity of risk-assessment tools for sexual recidivism—with both adolescents and adults—is retrospective. In other words, risk-assessment instruments are typically scored using archival file information, years after individuals have been assessed. One of the most serious threats to the validity of retrospective research of this nature is that file coders are dependent on the dated information that is in the file. It is often the case that the archival files that are being coded were created long before the risk-assessment instrument. Therefore, assessment and referral information is not necessarily recorded with the risk factors and, more importantly, the specific coding instructions in mind. Although this can be particularly problematic for dynamic risk factors based on psychological constructs such as sexual arousal or aggression, retrospective file coding can still be problematic for the most straightforward static risk factors. For example, if it is not known that a past sexual offense against a stranger is important to consider, then the exact nature of the relationship between the individual who offended and the individual who was victimized may not always be made explicit in the archival file materials. The first author participated as the second rater in a retrospective file-review study of the ERASOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1079063211407080">Morton, 2003</xref>), and it was very often necessary to arbitrarily rate a number of risk factors as <italic>not present</italic>, simply because there was no mention of the risk factor in the file. Although a file-coding process like this would result in a high level of interrater agreement, it is obviously a poor way to test the predictive validity of a risk-assessment tool as it was designed. In addition to conducting a prospective follow-up investigation of the validity of the ERASOR, we thought that it would be important to examine the validity of risk assessments completed by a group of clinicians who conduct risk assessments rather than study risk ratings made by 2 or 3 undergraduate or graduate students.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>ERASOR ratings were available for 191 adolescent males who were assessed between January of 2001 and October of 2007 at five agencies in southern Ontario, Canada. Although the ERASOR was designed to assist with risk assessments for both males and females, only five adolescent females were assessed at these agencies during this follow-up period. Given that meaningful comparisons between males and females could not be made, females were excluded from the present investigation. Ten of the 191 adolescents were in custody settings at the time of the assessment; the remainder were assessed at one of the five community-based agencies. These five agencies are those in the area that use the ERASOR and provide specialized services to adolescents who have offended sexually. The adolescents were between 12 and 19 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 15.34; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.53) at the time of the assessment, and all were convicted of and/or acknowledged criminal sexual behavior(s). The adolescents were assessed by one of 22 clinicians (including the first author), and each assessment involved a combination of clinical interviews, psychological testing, document reviews, and interviews with adult respondents such as parents and/or caregivers, child welfare workers, treatment providers, or probation officers. ERASOR ratings were made by clinicians immediately following comprehensive assessments, and all clinicians received at least 1 day of training from the first author regarding the development and use of the ERASOR. The mean number of ERASOR ratings completed by the clinicians in this investigation was 7.70 (<italic>SD</italic> = 14.95).</p>
<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063211407080">Table 1</xref>, most of the adolescents in the present study offended against younger children (individuals who were 4 or more years younger than the adolescent and below the age of 12) who were known to them. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063211407080">Table 1</xref>, it is also readily apparent that approximately half of the sample offended sexually against multiple victims, and almost a third of the participants had received prior sanctions from an adult for a previous sexual crime. The characteristics of this sample are similar to those observed in our earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211407080">Worling, 2004</xref>) investigation.</p>
<p>For 45 adolescents in this sample, independent ERASOR ratings were available from pairs of clinicians who worked jointly to complete the comprehensive assessments. These data were used to examine levels of interrater agreement. As in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211407080">Worling, 2004</xref>)—a study that was also based on real-time clinical assessments—therapist pairs did not consistently have access to identical information. It is not uncommon for one therapist on a team to interview the adolescent and the other therapist to interview parents, for example. In many cases, both therapists would have been present for at least some of the interviews with the adolescents and collateral sources, but this was not always the case.</p>
<p>With an order from a youth court judge, we obtained recidivism data from three sources: a national database of youth and adult criminal charges maintained by the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC), a provincial (Ontario) database of criminal charges for youth aged 12 to 17, and a provincial (Ontario) database of adult (age 18 and above) criminal charges. There were significant inconsistencies in the provincial database of youth charges; therefore, we were unable to use this data source.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1079063211407080">1</xref></sup> We also collected reports to treatment agencies from child welfare and/or probation when an adolescent had been charged with a subsequent sexual offense. Typically, referral sources would contact the original agencies for further treatment, a reassessment, or suggestions for additional resources when clients had been charged with subsequent sexual crimes. Unfortunately, the timing of the charges for new sexual offenses was not available; rather, we were only informed whether adolescents had been charged with a subsequent sexual crime during the follow-up period. In addition, reports to treatment agencies regarding nonsexual recidivism were not routinely collected. To examine sexual recidivism, therefore, we used two official sources of recidivism data (i.e., a national database of adult and youth charges and a provincial database of adult charges) and reports to agencies regarding new criminal charges. To examine nonsexual recidivism, we relied on the two official data sources. The total follow-up period for the present study ranged from 0.1 to 7.9 years with a mean of 3.66 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.08). Approval for this investigation was obtained from the Research Ethics Board at Thistletown Regional Centre, Ontario Ministry of Children and Youth Services.</p>

<p>The percentage-endorsement pattern for each of the ERASOR risk factors is displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063211407080">Table 1</xref>. For subsequent statistical analyses, scores for the ERASOR risk factors were assigned for individual risk factors as follows: <italic>present</italic> = 2, <italic>partially/possibly present</italic> = 1, <italic>not present/missing</italic> = 0. An ERASOR total score was also computed, and this was the sum of scores across all 25 items.</p>
<p>Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated using a one-way random effects model with absolute agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063211407080">Shrout &amp; Fleiss, 1979</xref>) to examine levels of interrater agreement for the 45 youth who were assessed by pairs of clinicians.

The single-measure ICC values for the total score, the clinical judgment rating, and the individual risk factors are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1079063211407080">Table 2</xref>. Note that there was significant interrater agreement for the clinical judgment rating, the total score, and for the individual risk factors on the ERASOR.

Therefore, we calculated the simple sum of risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic>, and there was significant interrater agreement for this score as well.</p>

<title>Prospective Predictive Validity: Sexual Recidivism</title>
<p>Of the 191 adolescents followed in this study, 18 (9.4%) were charged with a sexual reoffense during the approximately 3.66-year mean follow-up period. The national database of youth and adult criminal charges identified six of the sexual recidivists; the provincial database of adult criminal charges added six further sexual recidivists that were missed in the national database; reports to agencies from probation and/or child welfare identified the remaining six sexual recidivists who were charged with further sexual crimes and who were missed in both official data sources.</p>
<p>The clinical judgment ratings (<italic>high, moderate</italic>, or <italic>low</italic>) from the ERASOR were not significantly related to sexual recidivism over this follow-up period, AUC = 0.61 (95% confidence interval [CI] [.48, .74]), <italic>p</italic> = .13; however, the ERASOR total score was significantly predictive of sexual reoffending, AUC = 0.72 (95% CI [.61, .83]), <italic>p</italic> = .002, as was the simple sum of risk factors rated <italic>present</italic>, AUC = 0.73 (95% CI [.63, .84]), <italic>p</italic> = .001. The AUC values for the ERASOR total score and the sum of risk factors rated <italic>present</italic> were not significantly different, <italic>z</italic> = .50, <italic>p</italic> = .615.</p>
<p>Given that arithmetic scores outperformed structured clinical judgments over the course of the total follow-up period, we examined the predictive efficiency of possible cutoff scores. Of course, using cutoff scores based on the distribution of values in the present sample would lead to artificially inflated estimates of predictive accuracy; therefore, we extracted scores from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211407080">Worling, 2004</xref>) of 136 adolescents who had offended sexually—the majority (67%) of whom were residents of a specialized treatment program in Minnesota. Using one standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic>) above the mean to establish a cutoff score for <italic>high</italic> risk (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1079063211407080">Babchishin &amp; Hanson, 2009</xref>), we found that those in the 2004 study with an ERASOR total score of 34 or greater were above one <italic>SD</italic> (i.e., above the 84th percentile). We used the 50th percentile to differentiate <italic>low</italic> from <italic>moderate</italic> risk, as using 1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean would result in an inordinate number of adolescents rated as <italic>moderate</italic>. Given the relatively low base rates of sexual recidivism (based on criminal charges) for adolescents who have offended sexually, we believe that a <italic>low</italic> risk designation should be expected in more than 16% of cases.</p>
<p>We then applied these cutoff scores to the present sample to determine whether they had any predictive utility. Specifically, a total score from 0 to 25 was deemed <italic>low</italic>, a score between 26 and 33 was categorized as <italic>moderate</italic>, and a total score of 34 or greater was considered <italic>high</italic>. When these scores were applied to the present sample, 61.8% (118 of 191) of the participants were placed in the <italic>low</italic> group, 30.4% (58 of 191) were <italic>moderate</italic>, and 7.9% (15 of 191) were categorized as <italic>high</italic>. The sexual recidivism rates for the three groups were as follows: <italic>low</italic> 5.9% (7 of 118), <italic>moderate</italic> 12.1% (7 of 58), and <italic>high</italic> 26.7% (4 of 15). The use of these cutoff scores was significantly predictive of sexual reoffending in the present sample of 191 adolescents, AUC = 0.65 (95% CI [.51, .80]), <italic>p</italic> = .04.</p>
<p>We then repeated this analysis of the utility of cutoff scores using the simple sum of risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic>. From the data in our 2004 study, it was found that those with 10 or fewer risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic> were below the 51st percentile, and those with 15 or more risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic> were above 1 <italic>SD</italic>. With respect to the sum of risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic>, we examined the predictive accuracy of the following cutoff scores: <italic>low</italic> (0-10), <italic>moderat</italic>e (11-14), and <italic>high</italic> (15 and above). Of the 191 adolescents in the current sample, 51.3% (98 of 191) were categorized as <italic>low</italic>, 31.9% (61 of 191) were <italic>moderate</italic>, and 16.8% (32 of 191) were <italic>high</italic>. The sexual reoffense rates for the three groups were as follows: 4.1% (4 of 98) of the <italic>low</italic> group, 9.8% (6 of 61) of those categorized as <italic>moderate</italic>, and 25% (8 of 32) of those in the <italic>high</italic> group. Using these cutoff scores, the sum of risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic> was also significantly predictive of sexual reoffending in the present sample, AUC = 0.71 (95% CI [.60, .83]), <italic>p</italic> = .003. There was no significant difference between the sum of risk factors rated <italic>present</italic> and the ERASOR total score with respect to predictive efficiency, <italic>z</italic> = .–1.50, <italic>p</italic> = .135.</p>
<p>Given that the ERASOR was intended to assist in the estimation of short-term risk (i.e., up to 2 years), we also examined sexual recidivism predictions based on a shorter follow-up period. Although it would have been informative to use the entire sample and examine a fixed follow-up period, such as 2 years, we did not have the dates of the new sexual offenses from the reports to treatment agencies from probation/child welfare. Therefore, we looked instead at available ERASOR and recidivism data for those adolescents who were followed up for up to 2.5 years. Any shorter follow-up interval would have resulted in too few sexual recidivists to permit meaningful analyses. This resulted in a subgroup of 70 adolescents who were followed up for between 0.1 and 2.5 years (<italic>M</italic> = 1.4, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.71). The remaining 121 of the 191 adolescents were followed up for between 2.6 and 7.9 years. The sexual recidivism rate of 8.6% (6 of 70) for those in the shorter term follow-up period was comparable to that found with the full sample (i.e., 9.2%). Using this briefer time frame, clinical judgment ratings were significantly predictive of sexual recidivism, AUC = 0.82 (95% CI [.69, 96]), as was both the total score, AUC = 0.93 (95% CI [.86, .99]), and the sum of risk factors rated <italic>present</italic>, AUC = 0.90 (95% CI [.81, .99]). There were no significant differences among these three estimates of risk for the truncated follow-up period, all <italic>z</italic>s &lt; 1.94, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .05. We found that predictions based on the shorter mean follow-up period of 1.4 years were significantly more accurate than predications based on the overall mean follow-up interval of 3.66 years with respect to the clinical judgment ratings, the total score, and the simple sum of risk factors rated <italic>present</italic>, all <italic>z</italic>s &gt; 4.4, all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .0001.</p>
<p>Using the shorter follow-up interval, we then examined the utility of the cutoff scores derived from the 2004 study. For the ERASOR total score, 61% of the adolescents (43 of 70) were classified as <italic>low</italic>, 35% (25 of 70) were <italic>moderate</italic>, and 3% (2 of 70) were placed in the <italic>high</italic> group. The sexual recidivism rates for the three groups were as follows: 0% (0 of 43) for the <italic>low</italic> group, 20% (5 of 25) for the <italic>moderate</italic> group, and 50% (1 of 2) of those in the <italic>high</italic> group. The use of these cutoff scores for the ERASOR total score was significantly related to recidivism status for this briefer follow-up period, AUC = 0.86 (95% CI [.78, .93]), <italic>p</italic> = .004. When we examined cutoff scores for the simple sum of risk factors rated <italic>present</italic>, we found that 53% (37 of 70) adolescents were placed in the <italic>low</italic> group, 34% (24 of 70) were <italic>moderate</italic>, and 13% (9 of 70) were in the <italic>high</italic> group. Sexual recidivism rates for the groups were as follows: 0% (0 of 37) <italic>low</italic>, 8.3% (2 of 24) <italic>moderate</italic>, and 44.4% (4 of 9) <italic>high</italic>. The use of these cutoff scores for the sum of risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic> was significantly predictive of sexual reoffending over the briefer follow-up interval, AUC = 0.89 (95% CI [.79, .99]), <italic>p</italic> = .002. Overall, we found that cutoff scores for the shorter follow-up period were significantly more predictive of sexual recidivism than were cutoff scores for the entire follow-up interval, and this was true for both the total score, <italic>z</italic> = 3.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, and the simple sum of risk factors rated as <italic>present, z</italic> = 4.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001.</p>
<p>Correlations between sexual recidivism and the ERASOR risk factor scores are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1079063211407080">Table 3</xref>. Given that significant correlations were found only for dynamic risk factors, we examined the performance of the static and dynamic risk factors from the ERASOR. As such, we computed a static total score and a dynamic total score (with each factor coded as: <italic>present</italic> = 2, <italic>partially/possibly present</italic> = 1, <italic>not present/unknown</italic> = 0). The internal consistency (α) of the nine static items was .58, <italic>F</italic>(8, 1,700) = 51.65, <italic>p</italic> = .000, and the internal consistency of the dynamic items was .72, <italic>F</italic>(15, 3,023) = 57.38, <italic>p</italic> = .000. The aggregate dynamic total score was significantly predictive of sexual reoffending in the present sample, AUC = 0.72 (95% CI [.61, .83]), <italic>p</italic> = .002, whereas the aggregate static total score was not significantly related to sexual recidivism, AUC = 0.61 (95% CI [.47, .74]), <italic>p</italic> = .140. We also calculated a static and dynamic total score based on the sum of items rated as <italic>present</italic>. As above, the total number of dynamic risk factors was significantly predictive of sexual reoffending, AUC = 0.73 (95% CI [.63, .83]), <italic>p</italic> = .002, whereas the total number of static factors did not predict sexual recidivism, AUC = 0.60 (95% CI [.47, .74]), <italic>p</italic> = .149. There was no significant difference in predictive accuracy between the ERASOR total score and the sum of risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic> for the aggregate dynamic, <italic>z</italic> = 0.58, <italic>p</italic> = .550, or static risk factors, <italic>z</italic> = −0.07, <italic>p</italic> = .932.</p>

<title>Prospective Predictive Validity: Nonsexual Recidivism</title>
<p>Although the ERASOR was designed to assist with the estimation of risk for sexual reoffending, it could be informative to examine the predictive validity of the ERASOR with respect to nonsexual offending as well. This is particularly the case for nonsexual violent offenses, as there may be occasions when sexual crimes are charged or pled as nonsexual violent crimes. To address this, we examined the two official data sources: the federal registry of youth and adult criminal charges and the provincial registry of adult charges. New charges were divided into two categories: nonsexual violent offenses (e.g., physical assault, robbery, assault with a weapon, threatening death) and nonviolent offenses (e.g., possession of illegal drugs, theft, fraud, breach of probation conditions).</p>
<p>Over the course of the overall mean follow-up period of 3.66 years, 13.61% (26 of 191) of the adolescents had charges for nonsexual violent crimes recorded on one or both of the two official databases. Nonsexual violent recidivism was predicted by the ERASOR total score, AUC = 0.65 (95% CI [.53, .76]), <italic>p</italic> = .017, and by the simple sum of risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic>, AUC = 0.64 (95% CI [.52, .76]), <italic>p</italic> = .026, and there was no significant difference in predictive efficiency between these two measures, <italic>z</italic> = −0.66, <italic>p</italic> = .509. The clinical judgment ratings were only marginally predictive of violent, nonsexual reoffending, AUC = 0.61 (95% CI [.50, .73]), <italic>p</italic> = .066. Using the shorter follow-up interval that spanned from 0.1 to 2.5 years (<italic>M</italic> = 1.4), only 3 of the 70 adolescents in that subgroup had officially recorded charges for nonsexual violence. The ERASOR total score, AUC = 0.62 (95% CI [.39, .85]), <italic>p</italic> = .478, the simple sum of risk factors rated <italic>present</italic>, AUC = 0.62 (95% CI [.35, .89]), <italic>p</italic> = .477, and the clinical judgment ratings, AUC = 0.62 (95% CI [.39, .85]), <italic>p</italic> = .468, were unrelated to nonviolent recidivism for this time frame.</p>
<p>Turning to nonviolent reoffending, 18.32% (35 of 191) of the adolescents were charged with new nonviolent crimes during the total follow-up interval. The ERASOR total score, AUC = 0.57 (95% CI [.47, .68]), <italic>p</italic> = .176, the simple sum of risk factors rated <italic>present</italic>, AUC = 0.57 (95% CI [.46, .68]), <italic>p</italic> = .181, and the clinical judgment ratings, AUC = 0.52 (95% CI [.42, .62]), <italic>p</italic> = .729, were unrelated to nonviolent recidivism. Using data from the shorter follow-up interval, 10% (7 of 70) of the adolescents had charges for new nonviolent offenses. As was true for the total follow-up time frame, the ERASOR total score, AUC = 0.65 (95% CI [.42, .89]), <italic>p</italic> = .176, the simple sum of risk factors rated <italic>present</italic>, AUC = 0.65 (95% CI [.41, .90]), <italic>p</italic> = .177, and the clinical judgment ratings, AUC = 0.61 (95% CI [.41, .82]), <italic>p</italic> = .328, were not predictive of subsequent nonviolent crimes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this investigation, 191 adolescent males who had offended sexually were assessed by 1 of 22 clinicians, and the ERASOR was completed immediately following a comprehensive clinical assessment. Recidivism data were subsequently collected from three sources: a national database of youth and adult criminal charges, a provincial database of adult (age 18 and above) criminal charges, and reports to agencies from police, probation, and/or child welfare of new charges for sexual crimes. With a mean follow-up interval of 1.4 years, the clinical judgment rating, the total score, and the sum of risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic> were all significantly predictive of sexual reoffending. Over the entire follow-up period, which averaged 3.66 years, both the total score and the sum of risk factors rated as <italic>present</italic> were also significant predictors of sexual recidivism, status. We also found that cutoff scores, based on the distribution of total scores derived from a different sample of adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211407080">Worling, 2004</xref>), were significantly predictive of sexual reoffending over the course of both follow-up intervals. Overall, however, arithmetic scores (total and cutoff scores) were significantly more predictive over the shorter follow-up period. The fact that more contemporaneous ratings were generally more predictive of subsequent sexual offending suggests that it is important for clinicians to reassess adolescents and that clinical and forensic decisions are likely to be more accurate if they are based on more recent risk assessments.</p>
<p>Using data from the entire follow-up interval, we also found that the ERASOR total score and the simple sum of risk factors rated <italic>present</italic> were significantly predictive of new nonsexual violent crimes. It is important to examine nonsexual violent recidivism as there are likely times when sexual crimes are pled or charged as nonsexual violent crimes. Estimates of risk based on the ERASOR were not, however, related to new <italic>nonviolent</italic> crimes. This is evidence of the discriminant validity of the ERASOR, and it points to the fact that there are different risk factors to consider when predicting sexual versus general criminal recidivism for adolescents.</p>
<p>Unlike most studies of the validity of sexual recidivism risk-assessment tools, the present investigation was a prospective follow-up study of real-time clinical assessments rather than an investigation based on risk instruments being completed after reading dated file material. Furthermore, unlike the typical investigation that is based on ratings being completed by one or two students, we examined risk assessment ratings from a group of 22 masters and doctoral-level clinicians. As such, this study provides evidence of the reliability and validity of the ERASOR in a naturalistic context.</p>
<p>Despite these strengths, however, it is important to stress that there were only 18 adolescents who were detected and charged with subsequent sexual crimes during the entire follow-up period and only 6 adolescents who reoffended sexually during the briefer follow-up interval. Although the AUC is a robust statistic with respect to low base rates, larger samples will doubtlessly lead to more stable results. It is also critical to point out that the sample sizes for both our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211407080">Worling, 2004</xref>) and the current investigation are relatively small; therefore, readers should not resort to applying the cutoff scores that were examined herein. Rather, it will be important to collect larger, more representative samples to determine if cutoff scores such as these can reliably be applied for specific groups. Furthermore, the adolescents in this study were referred to specialized programs for assessment/treatment, and the predictive validity of the ERASOR may be different in other samples of adolescents who offend sexually. Finally, although data were missing for less than 6% of the sample for most risk factors, data regarding parental support were missing for approximately 15% of the cases, and it is unclear how this may have impacted clinical risk judgments.</p>
<p>Clinical judgment ratings (<italic>low, moderate</italic>, or <italic>high</italic>) were significant predictors of future sexual recidivism over a mean follow-up interval of 1.4 years, but they were not predictive over the lengthier mean follow-up period of 3.66 years. This may simply be a result of the fact that, as with most predictions of human behavior, estimates of future behavior are more apt to be accurate as the estimates become more contemporaneous. This is particularly salient for adolescents, given that they are experiencing significant maturational changes. An alternative explanation for this finding is that, for the 70 youth who were followed for the shorter time interval, there were 36% fewer raters involved in the assessments (i.e., 14 vs. 22 clinicians). Furthermore, 58 of the 70 youth in this particular subsample were rated by just seven clinicians. When there are many clinicians—working at a variety of settings—there is likely significant diversity in the meaning of risk categories. In more typical research paradigms, where there are only two or three raters reviewing file material, there is likely a much greater chance that <italic>low, moderate</italic>, and <italic>high</italic> risk will have a similar meaning. Of course, if it is consistently demonstrated in future research that arithmetic scores outperform structured clinical judgment ratings, then it may be necessary to consider using cutoff scores routinely.</p>
<p>Data regarding the five female adolescents were removed as this was too small a sample to permit meaningful comparisons based on gender. Unfortunately, there has not yet been enough research to determine risk factors for sexual recidivism for females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1079063211407080">Cortoni, Hanson, &amp; Coache, 2010</xref>), and it is unclear how useful existing risk-assessment tools may be for females who have offended sexually. There may be unique risk factors for females, and/or the risk factors identified in research with men may operate differentially as a function of gender. It will be important for researchers to identify risk factors for female adolescents who have offended sexually and to examine the reliability and validity of existing risk-assessment tools with female participants.</p>
<p>With a mean follow-up period of 3.66 years, 18 of the 196 adolescents (9.2%) in this study were detected and charged with subsequent sexual crimes. This result is close to the 12.5% sexual reoffense rate for adolescents from a meta-analysis of studies that had an average follow-up interval of approximately 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1079063211407080">Reitzel &amp; Carbonell, 2006</xref>). As we have stressed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211407080">Worling et al., 2010</xref>), it is important to be mindful of the fact that recidivism rates based on criminal charges are dependent on a number of variables, such as the person who was victimized making a disclosure, the disclosure being reported to authorities, the report being investigated by authorities, the police laying a criminal charge of a sexual nature, the charge being entered into a database, and the researcher having access to the database. It is likely that the true reoffense rate is higher than that found in this study, and this is one of the difficulties in studying the validity of risk-assessment tools for sexual recidivism. The fact that only two thirds (12 of 18) of the adolescents who were charged with new sexual reoffenses were captured in official databases raises the concern of researchers relying solely on official data sources. In their long-term follow-up study of adults who had offended sexually, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063211407080">Langevin et al. (2004)</xref> stressed the need to examine multiple sources of data, and they pointed to the fact that the Canadian national database (CPIC) was missing records for almost half of the adult participants in their investigation.</p>
<p>Although we did not have detailed information regarding treatment for the youth in this study, most of the youth in this sample were involved in specialized treatment following their assessments. It is possible that the risk assessment information influenced the outcome, and this is another factor that impacts on the validity of prospective studies of the accuracy of risk-assessment tools. In other words, it is very likely that treatment efforts were intensified for those youth who were rated as high risk, and this likely affected subsequent risk to reoffend. Of course, this would have impacted negatively on the predictive accuracy of the risk assessment—particularly with respect to the dynamic risk factors that would have been targeted in treatment. Adolescents rated as higher risk may have also been subjected to more stringent community supervision, thus limiting their opportunities to reoffend sexually during the short follow-up interval. In future research, it will be important to determine how interventions affect the prospective validity of risk-assessment tools and whether risk assessments are more accurate for those youth who are not provided with supervision or treatment. Given that most of the risk factors on the ERASOR are dynamic, it will also be important to determine whether more contemporaneous risk ratings (such as those completed at the time of treatment discharge) are more predictive than risk ratings assigned at the time of assessment.</p>
<p>In the present study, we found significant interrater agreement for the structured clinical judgment of risk (i.e., <italic>low, moderate</italic>, or <italic>high</italic>), the ERASOR total score, and for all of the individual risk factors. In their retrospective study of the ERASOR based on file review data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211407080">Viljoen et al. (2009)</xref> reported ICC values of .75 for the structured clinical rating and .90 for the total score. In other retrospective investigations based on file review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1079063211407080">Skowron (2004)</xref> reported an ICC of .87 for the ERASOR total score, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1079063211407080">Morton (2003)</xref> found an ICC of .68 for the structured clinical rating and .94 for the ERASOR total score. The research to date suggests, therefore, that there is significant interrater agreement using the ERASOR, and this is true for both prospective follow-up research and for studies based on retrospective file review.</p>
<p>The overall pattern of single-rating ICCs is quite similar to that found in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211407080">Worling, 2004</xref>) where we examined the interrater agreement of 28 clinicians who jointly rated 104 youth immediately following comprehensive clinical assessments. Although the level of interrater agreement was significant for all of the individual risk factors, there were five risk factors with relatively lower (i.e., ICC &lt; .70) levels of interrater agreement in both the present study and the 2004 study: No. 4 Unwillingness to alter deviant sexual interests/attitudes, No. 13 Diverse sexual assault behaviors, No. 18 Recent escalation in anger or negative affect, No. 20 High-stress family environment, No. 22 Parent(s) not supporting sexual offense–specific assessment/treatment, No. 23 Environment supporting opportunities to reoffend sexually. As noted in our earlier (2004) study, it may be necessary to alter the coding instructions for these items to increase interrater agreement or, ultimately, remove these items altogether—particularly if the results of future research indicate that these risk factors are not predictive of sexual recidivism for adolescents. Although these risk factors were described as potentially useful in a narrative review of the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1079063211407080">Worling &amp; Långström, 2006</xref>), they were not related to subsequent sexual recidivism in this particular sample. It is important to keep in mind, of course, that the correlations with sexual recidivism in the present study were based on a small sample of 18 recidivists.</p>
<p>When the correlations between individual ERASOR risk factors and sexual recidivism were examined, we found that five dynamic risk factors were significantly correlated with sexual reoffending: obsessive sexual interests/preoccupation with sexual thoughts, antisocial interpersonal orientation, lack of intimate peer relationships/social isolation, interpersonal aggression, and problematic parent–child relationships/parental rejection. It is interesting that most of the risk factors that are more consistently found in the literature to be predictive of sexual recidivism for adolescents were not found to be predictive in this study. For example, in a recent meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1079063211407080">McCann and Lussier (2008)</xref> found that an increased risk of sexual recidivism for adolescents was associated with static variables such as past sexual offences against a stranger, past sexual offences against a male, and past sexual offences against a child or an adult. These authors stressed, however, that the effect sizes were quite small, as were the samples used to calculate them. In our narrative review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1079063211407080">Worling &amp; Långström, 2006</xref>), we argued that the best supported risk factors included deviant sexual interests, past sexual offenses against multiple victims, past sexual offenses against strangers, prior criminal sanctions for a sexual crime, incomplete sexual offense–specific treatment, and social isolation. Social isolation was the only risk factor in this group of factors to be significantly related to sexual recidivism in the present investigation. Once again, correlations based on such a small sample of recidivists should be considered with caution, and the results might be more meaningful when combined with other findings in a weighted meta-analysis of risk factors. Indeed, one would not typically expect each risk factor from a risk-assessment tool to be correlated with recidivism within a single study. Rather, a significant correlation between recidivism and an estimate based on all of the risk factors reflects the need to consider multiple factors. Our finding that the aggregated dynamic risk factors from the ERASOR outperformed the aggregated static items is consistent with previous research with the J-SOAP-II (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063211407080">Martinez, Flores, &amp; Rosenfeld, 2007</xref>), and it highlights the importance of including dynamic risk factors in risk assessments for sexual recidivism.</p>
<p>Although some researchers have attempted to examine the performance of presumed scale scores from the ERASOR (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1079063211407080">McCoy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063211407080">Rajlic &amp; Gretton, 2010</xref>), it is noted both in the coding manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063211407080">Worling &amp; Curwen, 2001</xref>) and in subsequent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211407080">Worling, 2004</xref>) that the ERASOR is a single-scale checklist with 25 risk factors that fall under five categories: (a) sexual interests, attitudes, and behaviors, (b) historical sexual assaults, (c) psychosocial functioning, (d) family/environmental functioning, and (e) treatment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063211407080">Table 1</xref>). Three of the five ERASOR categories have four or fewer risk factors, and we would have never designed a measure that had so few items in a scale. In 2004, we found that the internal consistency (α) for the total score was .75, <italic>F</italic>(24, 3,216) = 35.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000. In the present investigation, the estimate of internal consistency was .74, <italic>F</italic>(24, 4,699) = 51.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000.</p>
<p>In summary, the results of the present study provide support for the predictive validity of the ERASOR. In conjunction with recent retrospective research with the J-SOAP-II (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1079063211407080">Prentky et al., 2010</xref>) and the JSORRAT-II (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1079063211407080">Epperson &amp; Ralston, 2009</xref>), our results support the notion that the risk of adolescent sexual reoffending can be estimated using structured risk-assessment tools. Of course, it would be ideal for researchers to continue to collect data that will enhance our ability to predict the risk of continued sexual offending by adolescents. It is important to point out, however, that the level of predictive accuracy observed in this study is not dissimilar to that found with actuarial tools developed for adults who have offended sexually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1079063211407080">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the level of predictive accuracy found in the present study is not dissimilar to that observed in studies of general juvenile recidivism. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063211407080">Schwalbe (2007)</xref> conducted a meta-analysis of 28 studies of more than 53,000 male and female juveniles involved in the criminal justice system. With an overall general reoffense rate of 45%, Schwalbe found a weighted mean AUC of 0.64 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.04) for the accuracy of risk-prediction tools for general criminal recidivism.</p>
<p>Of course, as with any tool, there is potential for risk-assessment instruments to be misused. For example, although there is an expectation in some jurisdictions that professionals can somehow make accurate predictions of the potential of a sexual reoffense for an adolescent that goes well into the youth’s adulthood, there are presently no data that could support such a proposition. Likewise, although there is often an expectation that risk assessments should be able to pinpoint the exact probability of a reoffense, the accuracy of current risk-assessment tools for both sexual and nonsexual recidivism—for both adults and adolescents—is such that precise probabilistic estimates that are generalizable across various populations are not yet possible. In addition to advances in risk-assessment research, it might also be prudent, therefore, for professionals in the field to continue to educate consumers of risk assessments about the scientific limitations of these tools. Finally, like most of the available risk-assessment tools, the ERASOR does not presently include protective factors, as there is very little research regarding factors that lead to the cessation of sexual offending behaviors for adolescents. It will be important in future research, therefore, to identify protective factors and determine how best to combine risk and protective factors to enhance judgments of future sexual behavior.</p>

<p>During the follow-up period for this study, Youth Justice Services in Ontario amalgamated service delivery for two age-groups of youth involved in the criminal justice system—those aged 12 to 15 (formerly known as “Phase I”) and those aged 16 to 17 (formerly known as “Phase II”). Recidivism data for both groups were combined during the amalgamation process; however, there were many inconsistencies and irregularities in the provincial youth records as a result. This made it impossible to determine whether some of the charges that were recorded were based on new or historical crimes, and many records were missing.</p>
