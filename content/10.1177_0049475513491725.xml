<abstract>
<p>We conducted a retrospective study of patients with fulminant amoebic colitis (FAC) over a 20 year period in an urban tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. After consideration for inclusion and exclusion criteria 25 cases were identified as FAC with the most common presentations being abdominal pain (84%). Nineteen (76%) underwent laparotomy for peritonitis with evidence of: colonic perforation in 10 (40%); faecal peritonitis in eight (32%); bowel gangrene in one (4%); and intra-abdominal abscess in two (8%). Nine (36%) deaths were recorded in the series – eight (53%) in the operated group and one (16.6%) in the medically-treated group. The optimal outcome can be achieved in FAC with aggressive resuscitation, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, including metronidazole, and total colectomy without anastomosis in patients with peritonitis.</p>

<p><italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> associated infections are an endemic health issue in the developing world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513491725">1</xref></sup> Although most are benign or asymptomatic, the invasive form of disease may rarely present as fulminant amoebic colitis (FAC), a severe necrotizing disease of the colon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513491725">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513491725"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513491725"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513491725"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049475513491725">6</xref></sup> Pakistan, an endemic region for amoebic colitis, is witness to all the various presentations of the disease. The rare presentation of FAC, even in developing countries, often causes delay in diagnosis thus increasing the morbidity and mortality of the disease entity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513491725">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049475513491725">6</xref></sup> This study reviews and analyses our experience in the management of FAC and endeavours to identify the associated clinical presentation, treatment and outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0049475513491725" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods and materials</title>
<p>We performed a retrospective review of cases with FAC presenting to the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, over a 20 year period (January 1989 to December 2009). Patients diagnosed with amoebiasis (614) during this period were evaluated for histological, serological or microscopy evidence of invasive intestinal amoebiasis (61). They were further evaluated for FAC, defined in our study as a case of proven invasive amoebiasis with one or more of the following conditions: intensive care unit or special care unit (ICU/SCU) admission; emergent surgical intervention; or mortality associated with the disease process. Patients with evidence of other co-existent parasitic infections were excluded from the study. After consideration for the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified 25 cases with FAC.</p>
<p>The medical records of these patients were reviewed to collect data which was entered and analysed using SPSS for Windows, Release 16.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences Inc, IL, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0049475513491725" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The study included 25 cases – 14 women (56%) and 11 men (44%). The mean age at presentation was 54.76 years (age range: 18–92 years; SD: 17.33). Abdominal pain and tenderness on examination were the most common presentations (21, 84%). Other presentations included blood diarrhoea (16, 64%) and fever (14, 56%) (Table 1). The mean duration of symptoms at presentation was 9.6 days. Risk factors for increased susceptibility for the fulminant course included: a history of diabetes mellitus (11,44%); poor nutritional status (albumin mean 1.9; SD +/− 0.68); and steroid use (8, 32%).</p>
<sec id="sec4-0049475513491725"><title>Diagnostic tests</title>
<p>All patients underwent an indirect haemagglutination assay (IHA). At a cut-off range of 1:256, 18 (72%) had serology proven invasive amoebiasis with the highest result being 1:8192. Histological diagnosis of the post-operative specimen (15) or tissue biopsy taken during endoscopic evaluation (5), established the diagnosis of amoebic colitis in 16 (64%). Two (8%) had ischaemic colitis and two (8%) had non-specific acute-on-chronic inflammation on histopathology but the diagnosis of amoebic colitis was established on either a positive IHA or faecal parasites in these patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0049475513491725"><title>Treatment and outcome</title>
<p>Nineteen patients (79%) underwent surgical treatment (mean age: 74.2 years), while six (21%) were treated conservatively (mean age: 48.63). The most common indication for surgery was acute abdomen. Perforation of the colon was found in 10 (40%); six (24%) had solitary perforations and four (16%) had multiple perforations observed during surgery. Abdominal abscess was noted in two (8%) and gangrenous bowel and bowel strictures were witnessed in one patient (4%) each (Figure 1). A right hemi-colectomy was performed in 14 (56%) and a subtotal colectomy was performed in one (4%). Four patients underwent exploratory laparotomy without any bowel resection. Postoperative complications occurred in 16 (Table 2).</p>
<p>There were nine deaths in our series (36%). One (16.7%) of the six cases undergoing conservative treatment died. Three of the four (75%) who underwent laparotomy and washout with no resection died. The mortality following colonic resection was seen in five of 14 (35.7%) who underwent right hemicolectomy but not in the patient who underwent subtotal colectomy.</p>
<p>Mean ICU and hospital stay of the patients was 6.7 (SD+/−7.7) and 13.9 (SD+/−11.4) days, respectively.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="sec6-0049475513491725" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Due to the rarity of FAC, the diagnosis is difficult and, at times, only made postoperatively on histopathologic examination. The presence of abdominal pain and tenderness that is rapidly progressing, along with the presence of bloody diarrhoea, should raise considerable suspicion, especially in the Asian subcontinent where the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease is relatively low.</p>
<p>Acute abdomen is the most common reason for surgical intervention as also seen in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513491725">2</xref></sup> The importance of early and aggressive surgical treatment has been emphasized in various studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513491725">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513491725"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513491725"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513491725">5</xref></sup> Despite such intervention, cases series have depicted dismal results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513491725">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513491725">3</xref></sup> The overall mortality rate of our study was 36%. However, the postoperative mortality was slightly higher (42%). Case series published previously have reported mortality rates as high as 89%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513491725">2</xref></sup> in the pre-ICU and broad spectrum antibiotic era. Our study period incorporates cases from the past 20 years in an attempt to shed light on the true mortality rate in the modern era.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049475513491725">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The conservatively managed group in our series did not undergo any surgical intervention as they responded well to the initial medical management. These patients were younger (mean age: 48.6 years) and, thus, better equipped to handle the disease process. The low mortality rate in this group should not be used to advocate conservative management in FAC. In our opinion, these patients were self-selected due to their rapid response to initial treatment and ICU care.

<p>Primary anastomosis was not considered in any case as previous studies have reported a high failure rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049475513491725">6</xref></sup> due to severe inflammation, peritoneal contamination and the colon becoming very friable. A significantly high complication rate was noted in our series. This may be due to the contaminated nature of the procedures undertaken which may have resulted in the high rate of wound infection and abdominal abscess.</p>
<p>The optimal outcome can be achieved in FAC with: aggressive resuscitation; intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, including metronidazole; and subtotal colectomy with ileostomy in patients with peritonitis. Patients who only underwent a peritoneal washout and limited colonic resection had an increased postoperative morbidity and mortality in our series. This could be attributable to ongoing sepsis from the remaining potentially diseased colon.

</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0049475513491725" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Even today, FAC results in significant morbidity and mortality. Surgical intervention remains the standard of care, especially in patients with signs of peritonitis. In our opinion, conservative treatment should only be considered in selective patients who have responded rapidly to the initial medical therapy. Presence of signs of peritonitis should always be considered a red flag and such patients should undergo exploratory laparotomy as an emergency procedure.</p>
