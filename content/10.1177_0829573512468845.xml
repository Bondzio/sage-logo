<abstract>
<p>It is now recognized that there is a very high prevalence of psychological disorders among children and adolescents and relatively few receive psychological treatment. In the current article, we present the argument that levels of distress and dysfunction among young people are substantially underestimated and the prevalence of psychological problems is higher than realized because of a variety of factors. In particular, it is suggested that psychological problems are underestimated due, in part, to the presence of subthreshold conditions that do not meet diagnostic criteria yet involve substantial distress and impairment. In addition, we focus on a subset of children and adolescents who experience profound distress yet keep it hidden or disguised because of a personality style characterized by self-concealment and a tendency to engage in perfectionistic self-presentation. The characteristics of these students who are “flying under the radar” are described with a discussion of associated familial, cultural, and school factors that reduce the likelihood of these students ever seeking help. Given our premise that psychological problems are substantially underestimated, it is apparent that schools have a vitally important role in mental health promotion in terms of the need for proactive system-wide preventive interventions led by school mental health counsellors. Broad programs are needed to bolster levels of resilience and the willingness to seek help among all children and adolescents but especially among those students who would otherwise not be on anyone’s radar screen.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>Il est maintenant reconnu qu’il y a une très haute présence de désordres psychologiques parmi les enfants et les adolescents car relativement peu reçoit un traitement psychologique. Dans l’article présent, nous présentons l’argument que les nivaux de détresse et le dysfonctionnement parmi les jeunes personnes sont substantiellement sous-estimé et la répandu de problèmes psychologiques est plus haute qu’on l’aperçoit basé d’une variété de facteurs. En particulier, il est suggéré que les problèmes psychologiques sous-estiment, en partie, à la présence de conditions infraliminaire qui ne conforme pas aux critères diagnostiques mais implique la détresse et la diminution de capacités. De plus, nous nous concentrons sur un sous-ensemble d’enfants et sur les adolescents qui cachent leurs détresses les plus profondes mais qu’il donnent une impression incorrecte par un style de personnalité caractérisé par la dissimulation de soi-même et une tendance de s’engager dans la présentation de soi-même comme perfectionniste. Les caractéristiques de ces étudiants qui “s’enfuit sous le radar” sont décrites avec une discussion d’associé familial, culturel, et facteurs d’école qui réduisent la probabilité de ces étudiants de ne jamais chercher de l’aide. Donner notre prémisse que les problèmes psychologiques sont largement sous-estimés, il est évident que les écoles ont un rôle extrêmement important dans la promotion de la santé mentale en termes de la nécessité d’un système proactive des interventions préventives menées dans les écoles par des conseillers santé mentale. De vastes programmes sont nécessaires pour soutenir des niveaux de résistance et la complaisance pour chercher l’aide parmi tous les enfants et les adolescents, mais surtout parmi les étudiants qui ont besoin d’aide mais que c’est moins visible.</p>

<body>
<p>Anyone paying close attention to recent epidemiological data must be growing increasingly alarmed by mounting evidence of how just widespread psychological problems seem to be among our younger people. It is now estimated in Canada that at any one time, an estimated 14% of children aged 4 to 17 years (more than 800,000 children in Canada) have clinically important disorders that cause significant distress and impairment at home, at school, and in the community, with anxiety disorders being most prevalent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0829573512468845">Waddell, McEwan, Shepherd, Offord, &amp; Hua, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0829573512468845">Waddell, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0829573512468845">Waddell (2007)</xref>, mental health problems are arguably the leading health problems that Canadian children face after infancy. Fewer than 25% of children with psychological disorders receive specialized treatment. Comorbidity adds to the burden since more than 50% of children with a disorder have two or more disorders at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0829573512468845">Waddell et al., 2005</xref>). According to the Early Years Study 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0829573512468845">McCain, Mustard, &amp; Shanker, 2007</xref>), it is estimated that in Ontario alone the cost of behavioural and mental health problems triggered by problems in early childhood is $30 billion per year.</p>
<p>New data emerging from the United States paint a particularly stark picture. Merikangas and associates have produced several reports based on the results of their heroic epidemiological study. This investigation is the first widespread clinical assessment of a nationally representative sample of adolescents in the United States between the ages of 13 and 18 years old. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0829573512468845">Merikangas et al. (2010)</xref> reported findings for 10,213 adolescents and found that the overall prevalence of disorders meeting their criteria for severe impairment or distress was 22.2% (i.e., 2 out of 9 adolescents). Anxiety disorders were most common (31.9%), followed by behavioural disorders (19.1%), and mood disorders (14.3%). They concluded that these incredibly high numbers point to the urgent need for early prevention and intervention.</p>
<p>Follow-up analyses by this research team confirmed that only a small proportion of adolescents who need some form of intervention actually receive it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0829573512468845">Merikangas et al. (2011)</xref> conducted a more fine-grained analysis based on data from more than 6,000 adolescents and found that only about one third (36.2%) of adolescents with an identifiable mental disorder actually received service for their disorder. More severe forms of disorder were more likely to be addressed by psychological treatments but even among those with severe impairment, only half of the adolescents requiring treatment actually received it. The highest levels of intervention were found for more observable forms of disorder, with 59.8% of adolescents with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder receiving treatment and 45.4% of adolescents with behavioural disorders receiving treatment. In contrast, fewer than one in five adolescents with an anxiety disorder, eating disorder, or substance abuse disorder received any form of treatment. These data accord with accounts and suggestions that internalizing problems (e.g., depression, anxiety), relative to more overt behavioural problems, are much less observable and are much less likely to garner therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>The notion that young people with internalizing symptoms are less likely to receive treatment is in keeping with the findings of a recent study conducted in Ontario involving an analysis of the 370 adolescent suicides that took place between the years 2000 and 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0829573512468845">Soor et al., 2012</xref>). Analyses were based on data obtained from the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario. This study found that the magnitude of the usual gender difference in completed suicides was reduced among younger people, with their being a 2:1 ratio of suicide among males versus females as a result of increased suicide among adolescent females. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of this analysis is that only 66 of the 370 adolescents who took their lives had previously received psychological treatment of any kind. It is likely that a very substantial proportion of the 82.1% of adolescents who killed themselves had a suicide without any apparent warning signs.</p>
<p>Clearly, it is generally recognized that the mental health needs of children and adolescents in Canada and elsewhere are not being met, but it is our view that the needs are actually much greater than imagined. That is, many psychological problems are going undetected and the situation is worse than realized and immediate proactive, pervasive interventions are needed. It is our contention that the widespread prevalence of psychological problems among younger people is underestimated due to several factors. We will focus on two factors: (a) the presence of subthreshold conditions that still warrant intervention and (b) the realization that a significant proportion of distressed children and adolescents have a personality style that is focused on not being publicly identified and recognized for having psychological problems. Clearly, other factors also contribute, such as a tendency to rely on observations provided by teachers who lack training in mental health issues and who must rely on their subjective judgments of who needs help (for a discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0829573512468845">Trudgen &amp; Lawn, 2011</xref>). We begin by briefly discussing the problem of subthreshold conditions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0829573512468845">
<title>The Clinical Significance of Subclinical Levels of Dysfunction</title>
<p>The notion that subthreshold levels of depression have clinical significance was discussed at length by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0829573512468845">Flett, Vredenburg, and Krames (1997)</xref> in their analysis of the continuity of the depression. Flett et al. summarized extensive evidence indicating that people who had symptoms of depression but not enough to warrant a clinical diagnosis still had significant life impairment and a level of suffering that often escalated into major depression. This scenario has clear implications for the level of risk that exists for children and adolescents who have symptoms of distress that may not, at least initially, warrant a clinical diagnosis.</p>
<p>Recent investigations of subclinical conditions in adolescents continue to indicate that, in general, psychological problems that do not meet diagnostic thresholds at present may eventually meet diagnostic criteria and there is ample reason to intervene prior to the escalation into full-blown disorders. Much of this work has been conducted by Peter Lewinsohn and his team of collaborators. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0829573512468845">Klein, Shankman, Lewinsohn, and Seeley (2009)</xref> summarized what is currently known about subthreshold depression. They indicated that the 12-month prevalence of subthreshold depression ranges from 3% to 7%, but the lifetime prevalence may be as high as 26%, with mounting evidence of extensive functional impairment. Their new data analyses of the life courses of 225 adolescents with subthreshold depression (i.e., an episode of 1 week or more of depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure along with at least two other symptoms) showed that 116 (46.5%) had progressed to a state of full-blown depression when reassessed in their early thirties. Overall, it was estimated that two thirds of the 225 participants who had symptoms of subclinical depression during adolescence would have clinical depression at some point during adulthood. Earlier research had already established the clear clinical significance and level of impairment of depressive symptoms that did not meet prescribed diagnostic standards (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0829573512468845">Lewinsohn, Solomon, Seeley, &amp; Zeiss, 2000</xref>). Other work by this team examined the course of a wide variety of subthreshold conditions assessed in adolescents. This 15-year study found that a wide range of subthreshold conditions in adolescents had an increased probability of escalating into a full-blown disorder meeting clinical criteria. Subthreshold conditions that conferred risk included anxiety, depression, substance use disorder, and conduct disorder (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512468845">Shankman et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>While the primary focus of most research on subclinical conditions has been on subclinical depression, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512468845">Shankman et al. (2009)</xref> noted that other types of symptoms are quite prevalent and involve substantial risk of escalation. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0829573512468845">Stice, Marti, Shaw, and Jaconis (2009)</xref> studied 496 adolescent girls and found that about 12% of these girls had some form of eating disorder. They also reported that 0.6%, 6.1%, and 4.6% of the girls, respectively, had subthreshold levels of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Moreover, it was ascertained that subthreshold bulimia nervosa and subthreshold binge eating disorder were clearly associated with elevated treatment, impairment, and distress.</p>
<p>Similarly, research on subclinical attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behaviours also points to the risk inherent in having seemingly milder psychological conditions. A recent Swedish investigation established that subclinical levels of these conditions were precursors for many other psychiatric symptoms as well as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0829573512468845">Malmberg, Edborn, Wargelius, &amp; Larsson, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, the implications of these findings are clear. In addition to children and adolescents who meet symptoms criteria for clinical disorders, there will be a substantial proportion of other students in any elementary school or high school who have some psychological symptoms and these students have a substantial risk of developing a full-blown disorder or disorders as they progress through the school system and they go on to encounter the experiences of adulthood. Thus, epidemiological studies of disorders in children and adolescents need to also consider those who have symptoms but do not currently warrant diagnoses. We now turn to a description and discussion of those seemingly adjusted children and adolescents who are hiding their problems while they attempt to “fly under the radar.”</p>

<title>Disguised Distress: The Roles of Self-Concealment and Perfectionistic Self-Presentation</title>
<p>Research in our laboratories is focusing extensively on those children, adolescents, and emerging adults who are prone to various forms of distress but who also have a personality style characterized by an extreme unwillingness to let others know about their levels of distress. This personality orientation likely plays a central role in conditions referred to as “disguised depression” or “smiling depression” that involve false portrayals of actual levels of distress. This goes beyond depression to include a number of mental health conditions known as “secret illnesses” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0829573512468845">Miller &amp; Jome, 2010</xref>). Some of these distressed younger people seem to be determined to cover up their flaws and mistakes no matter what the cost. They are elevated in levels of trait self-concealment and perfectionistic self-presentation and these personality features make it unlikely that self-disclosures will take place even when experiencing severe psychological pain in the form of psychache. A poignant case example of disguised distress was provided by one of our senior undergraduate students who indicated during an initial meeting that she wanted to study perfectionism in order to try to understand her friend, a third-year undergraduate student who had taken his life without warning the previous summer. When asked what kind of perfectionism her friend had, the thesis student indicated,
<disp-quote>
<p>The worst kind. The kind where the person seems invulnerable and never lets on that there is a problem and never gets help. He had many friends who would have tried to help him right away if only he had just let us know.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The notion of disguised or hidden distress is not new. There are several descriptions of depressed people who are motivated to hide their distress (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0829573512468845">Nicole et al., 2007</xref>) and calls have been issued for diagnostic systems to consider a condition described as disguised depression (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0829573512468845">Stotland, 2010</xref>). Typically, accounts provided by distressed people focus on the theme of covering up one’s upset by hiding behind a mask (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0829573512468845">Allan &amp; Dixon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0829573512468845">Carlen &amp; Bengtsson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0829573512468845">Gammell &amp; Stoppard, 1999</xref>). This condition is particularly evident among younger people because of their elevated sense of self-consciousness and reflects individual differences in the unwillingness to disclose distress (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0829573512468845">Greenland, Scourfield, Maxwell, Prior, &amp; Scourfield, 2009</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0829573512468845">Draucker (2005)</xref> used a qualitative analysis to illustrate the various ways that distressed adolescents seem invulnerable and hide behind a façade. Similarly, adolescent girls with an eating disorder are highly focused on presenting themselves in a positive light, including hiding evidence of negative emotions and emphasizing positive emotional displays that may be true or false (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0829573512468845">Gustafsson, Edlund, Daven, Kjellin, &amp; Norring, 2011</xref>). For instance, a 16-year-old girl named Celia recounted that “You can’t be down one day, you have to be happy all the time and positive and everything. Even if you aren’t feeling happy that day, you still have to run around being positive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0829573512468845">Gustafsson et al., 2011</xref>, p. 106).</p>
<p>We maintain that disguised, hidden distress is much more prevalent among younger people than is realized as a result of concerns about stigma and mounting exposure to life stressors, including pressures to be perfect and life conditions that make it difficult to maintain a positive possible self. At the same time, the increasing use of social media enables many adolescents to maintain superficial attachments to others and keep their true feelings unknown. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0829573512468845">Valkenburg and Peter (2011)</xref>, online communication among young people is highly amenable to self-presentation. Young people who are determined to hide their distress may never be detected if they remained relatively detached from others and they have the requisite social skills to present an idealized image. And even if they are detected, these self-presenters may be superb at manipulating the clinical assessment process. Indeed, we have heard of instances in which a concerned family member took a young person for help, but the child or adolescent was never admitted for treatment because he or she presented as high functioning and no problems warranting intervention were detected by trained mental health workers.</p>
<p>Individual differences in trait self-concealment contribute to these self-presentations. The concept of trait self-concealment was introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0829573512468845">Larson and Chastain (1990)</xref>. The Self-Concealment Scale is a brief measure of trying to hide negative aspects of the self from others. It assesses the extent to which someone is secretive about embarrassing aspects of the self. Elevated levels of self-concealment are associated with perfectionistic self-presentation but not to the extent that these constructs are redundant with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0829573512468845">Hewitt et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, self-concealment seems to mediate the link between maladaptive perfectionism and distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0829573512468845">Kawamura &amp; Frost, 2004</xref>). Importantly, a study of almost 800 students confirmed that self-concealment is linked with negative attitudes towards seeking psychological help (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0829573512468845">Cepeda-Benito &amp; Short, 1998</xref>) and it seems evident that self-concealment includes hiding distress from people who could otherwise be providing assistance.</p>
<p>The concept of perfectionistic self-presentation grew out of observations that some perfectionists are highly defensive and characterized by an obsessive need to seem perfect in public. This perfectionistic self-presentation is a form of impression management that reflects social pressures to be perfect (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0829573512468845">Hewitt et al., 2003</xref>). These same individuals typically see themselves as far from perfect and as not meeting prescribed social expectations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0829573512468845">Mushquash &amp; Sherry, 2012</xref>) so they portray a false self and hide behind a mask by trying to seem exceptionally competent, perhaps even to the point of trying to seem flawless. This need to seem perfect can have many ramifications and ways of being manifested in school contexts. Some students may project an image of invulnerability and act as if mistakes simply do not apply to them. Others may be more debilitated in public performance situations; they may suffer from speech anxiety and will be highly avoidant and distressed when they must speak in class.</p>
<p>Another concern is that students who are preoccupied with needing to seem perfect will not seek help when it is required because the act of seeking help could be regarded as an open admission of failure (for a related discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0829573512468845">Nadler, 1983</xref>). Thus, teachers and counsellors who are in a position to provide help may never realize that help is needed when students are good at maintaining the façade.</p>
<p>The initial empirical work on perfectionistic self-presentation was conducted on adults (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0829573512468845">Hewitt et al., 2003</xref>). The 27-item Perfectionistic Self-Presentation Scale was developed to measure three facets: (a) perfectionistic self-promotion (i.e., actively promoting one’s supposed perfection), (b) nondisplay of imperfections (i.e., concern over behavioral displays of imperfection), and (c) nondisclosure of imperfections (i.e., concern over verbal disclosures of imperfection). Research using this scale suggests these facets predict unique variance in psychological distress when pitted against other personality measures, including measures of trait perfectionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0829573512468845">Hewitt et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0829573512468845">Hewitt et al. (2011)</xref> created a version of this measure that is suitable for use with children and adolescents. The Perfectionistic Self-Presentation Scale—Junior Form (PSPS-JR) is an 18-item scale. It has eight items that tap perfectionistic self-promotion, six items that tap the non-display of imperfections facet, and four items that assess the nondisclosure of imperfections facet. The development of this scale for use with children and adolescents is in keeping with descriptions of some children being high in public self-consciousness and displaying a “false front” that develops in an attempt to compensate for vulnerable self-esteem (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0829573512468845">Elliott, 1982</xref>). Individual differences in this self-presentational style are evident among children in the early elementary school years, thus suggesting that the hiding of distress and despair may occur for some at a relatively young age.</p>
<p>Our ongoing research on the nature of perfectionistic self-presentation is providing a clearer picture of the features of this behavioural style. Those high in perfectionistic self-presentation have feelings of being an impostor. This style is accompanied by profound feelings of shame and the sense that not only is the self deficient in key ways but also other people are currently aware or are about to become aware of these deficiencies. We have also found that while perfectionistic self-presenters may seem calm and invulnerable on the outside in terms of their public persona, they tend to suffer from chronic ruminative thoughts and brooding on the inside. In fact, our work is indicating that the association that is found between trait perfectionism and rumination in early adolescents, among others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0829573512468845">Flett, Coulter, Hewitt, &amp; Nepon, 2011</xref>), is not as strong as the link between perfectionistic self-presentation and rumination. There is a particularly robust association between perfectionistic self-presentation and ruminative brooding in response to negative interpersonal events that involve being emotionally hurt, mistreated, and humiliated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0829573512468845">Nepon, Flett, Hewitt, &amp; Molnar, 2011</xref>). These data suggest that children and youth with high levels of perfectionistic self-presentation have heightened interpersonal sensitivity and a negative cognitive style that may prolong and exacerbate their feelings of distress. But this brooding may not be evident to others when it is hidden behind a façade that is covering up a deepening sense of shame and embarrassment.</p>
<p>A recent investigation of the origins of perfectionistic self-presentation conducted with 178 adolescents established that perfectionistic self-presentation is a reflection of insecure attachment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0829573512468845">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). A key element here was the association detected between fearful attachment and the self-presentation facet tapping the nondisclosure of imperfections. Additional analyses by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0829573512468845">Chen et al. (2012)</xref> showed that adolescents with higher levels of perfectionistic self-presentation also reported lower levels of social connectedness. They also established that the association between fearful attachment and lack of social connectedness was mediated by the nondisclosure of imperfections subscale.</p>
<p>The social disconnection of perfectionistic adolescents is likely due, at least in part, to a proneness to social anxiety. Indeed, as might be expected, empirical work indicates that facets of perfectionistic self-presentation predict unique variance in social anxiety in early adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0829573512468845">Flett, Coulter, &amp; Hewitt, 2012</xref>). Previous research with university students found similarly that perfectionistic self-presentation uniquely predicted social anxiety (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0829573512468845">Hewitt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0829573512468845">Nepon et al., 2011</xref>). This consistent link has important implications for our contention that there are many elementary students and high school students hiding their distress as a reflection of a dysfunctional personality style. Recall that the recent epidemiological study in the United Stated found initially that anxiety disorders constituted the most predominant type of disorder among adolescents (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0829573512468845">Merikangas et al., 2010</xref>). A follow-up study focusing on social phobia found that almost 1 in 10 adolescents suffered from social phobia and only about 10% of those with social phobia received treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0829573512468845">Burstein et al., 2011</xref>). Further evidence of low rates of treatment for adolescents with social anxiety emerged from another recent study; here it was found that only about 1 in 7 high school students suffering from social anxiety obtained treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0829573512468845">Colognori et al., 2012</xref>). Adolescents who are characterized jointly by high levels of public self-consciousness and perfectionistic self-presentation are likely to be very highly focused on controlling overt indicators of their social anxiety so that the symptoms are not visible to other people. When students struggle to control visible signs and indicators of anxiety in social settings, these young people tend to become socially avoidant and isolated, and this likely contributes to the link between perfectionistic self-presentation and low social connectedness in adolescents (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0829573512468845">Chen et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>As reflected by the earlier case example of suicide without warning, one of our primary concerns is the role that perfectionistic self-presentation may play in extreme distress in the form of suicidal thoughts and tendencies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0829573512468845">Friedman (2006)</xref> reported that a significant proportion of adolescents are very secretive and hide mental health problems, and this extends to keeping parents and other people unaware of suicidal acts. This tendency was first identified in research by Apter and King and their associates who described young adolescent soldiers who were seemingly high functioning yet killed themselves without warning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0829573512468845">Apter et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0829573512468845">King &amp; Apter, 1996</xref>). A significant proportion of these young soldiers were deemed to be highly perfectionistic (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0829573512468845">King, Apter, &amp; Zohar, 2007</xref>) but hiding behind a self-presentation of superb achievement in order to reduce the likelihood of drawing attention to their self-perceived limitations and psychological problems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0829573512468845">Sorotzkin (1998)</xref> observed that gifted children and adolescents are often particularly adept at engaging in behaviour that resembles perfectionistic self-presentation because their accomplishments deflect attention towards achievements and away from feelings of inadequacy and noticing self-destructive tendencies.</p>
<p>Although there has not been extensive research thus far on the role of perfectionistic self-presentation in adolescent suicide, one of our new investigations does suggest that there are substantial reasons for concern. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0829573512468845">Roxborough et al. (2012)</xref> conducted a study of children and adolescents who were psychiatric outpatients in Canada. This study included measures of both trait perfectionism and perfectionistic self-presentation. It was found that both perfectionistic self-presentation and socially prescribed perfectionism were associated significantly with a measure of suicide potential. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0829573512468845">Roxborough et al. (2012)</xref> also reported that the association between suicide potential and the need to avoid seeming imperfect was mediated by a history of being bullied and elevated levels of interpersonal hopelessness. Overt acts of bullying are particularly distressing for anyone who is being bullied but this should especially be the case for an already vulnerable adolescent who is highly invested in maintaining a public persona and image indicating that they are flawless, life is perfect, and everything is under control.</p>

<sec id="section3-0829573512468845">
<title>Factors That Contribute to Self-Concealment and Perfectionistic Self-Presentation</title>
<p>Clearly, several factors contribute to elevated levels of self-concealment and perfectionistic self-presentation and the presence of some of these factors in combination with this personality style will further reduce the likelihood of seeking help and being identified as someone who needs help. Contributing factors include concerns about stigma and self-stigma, and being raised in a culture that is less open about mental health issues. For instance, it has been suggested that norms about saving face and other cultural values reduce the likelihood of seeking help for psychological problems in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0829573512468845">Fang, Pieterse, Friedlander, &amp; Cao, 2011</xref>). But it is also important to consider family factors. Research in our laboratory is examining perfectionistic self-presentation in the family. It is often the case that children low in self-disclosure have been raised in a family that is focused on promoting the image of “the perfect family” and any problems are not to be shared with people outside the family. Obviously, school environments can also play a vitally important role in terms of how easy it is easy for children and adolescents to disclose and whether there are rampant concerns about being victimized by peers for “being different” and for being open about adjustment problems.</p>

<title>Implications for Prevention and Early Intervention in Schools</title>
<p>Collectively, the number of young people with identified and unidentified mental health problems vastly outnumbers available supports in all regions of Canada and most areas of the world. So what is to be done? Schools have a vital role to play in improving the emotional and interpersonal lives of children and their families. Accordingly, there is a growing trend towards implementing and evaluating school-wide interventions in an attempt to bolster mental health promotion. While there is strong evidence of the effectiveness of prevention efforts in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0829573512468845">Durlak, Weissberg, Dymnicki, Taylor, &amp; Schellinger, 2011</xref>), several pragmatic problems limit the potential effectiveness of school-based interventions. These were summarized recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0829573512468845">Reinke, Herman, and Ialongo (2012)</xref>. They focused specifically on (a) the lack of necessary infrastructure in schools and school systems; (b) difficulties in recruiting and retaining participants because of the lack of motivation among certain target parents and teachers; and (c) the modest effects when seeking to ameliorate particularly challenging behaviours, often because only one risk factor is addressed when several risk factors should be targeted.</p>
<p>If viewed from a systems perspective, there are several barriers that must be circumvented and ultimately removed in order for system-wide prevention to take place. One obvious limitation is the financial cost involved. The implementation of resilience programs will require a financial commitment at a time when financial resources are already severely stretched. Another complication is the lack of coordination and a shared plan among government ministries that are directly or indirectly responsible for the health and well-being of children and adolescents. School needs must also be acknowledged and taken into account. Here it must be recognized that one barrier that must be addressed is the possible resistance of educators who already feel overwhelmed in terms of levels of burnout and who feel that there already is not enough time in a typical school day to meet curriculum expectations and demands.</p>
<p>These problems notwithstanding, it seems that the mental health problems among our younger people are approaching crisis proportions and there is a growing need for system-wide interventions designed to bolster resilience, emotional self-regulation, and interpersonal skills. Canadian provinces such as Ontario have recognized the broad need to promote resilience; in Ontario, the Ministry of Child and Youth Services identified as one of their primary goals the enhancement of levels of resilience among all children in the province. In Canada, the 2008 National Dialogue on Resilience in Youth provided an initial assessment of what is currently known about resilience and what needs to be done to foster resilience in children and youth in Canada. The participants at this unique meeting put together by the national organization <italic>The Learning Partnership</italic> concluded that resilience must be promoted and developed in order to help young people succeed in school and in life in general but it will require the collective efforts and actions of parents and families, children and youth, schools and school systems, communities and organizations, researchers and researchers-in-training, and policy makers and governments. Moreover, it was noted that two key elements in moving forward are (a) the development of partnerships in the education and social service systems and (b) knowledge mobilization that enables diverse partners to share ideas and learn from each other.</p>
<p>Proactive solutions require the active engagement of school systems, family systems, and the broader community in our efforts to promote resilience. School-based resilience programs and interventions must be developed. These programs should not only be based on traditional means of knowledge translation, knowledge exchange, and knowledge implementation but should also recognize contemporary trends by incorporating and utilizing the various media used in today’s society by today’s children and youth. Most important, from our perspective, prevention efforts must target vulnerability factors, such as perfectionism, self-criticism, and pessimism, and they must find ways to address the needs of young people who tend to suffer in silence. A key message that must be incorporated into prevention efforts is that feeling distressed is something that is common among young people and the young person who is feeling this way is far from alone; that is, many other adolescents are likely feeling the same way but are keeping their distress hidden from others.</p>
<p>A related and vitally important issue is the question of who will offer these essential resilience programs. Standard models and practices of guidance deliver already suffer from a lack of available trained staff. Classroom teachers neither have the necessary training in mental health promotion nor should they be expected to be the prime delivery source. A positive step is the increased mental health promotion role for school nurses in places, such as in Ontario but what is clearly needed is the creation of a new role—the school mental health counsellor/coach, who has not only received professional training as a teacher but who also has extensive training in basic psychological principles and techniques. These mental health counselors can direct and facilitate class discussions designed to enhance mental health literacy and reduce levels of stigma. They can also implement positive interventions designed to promote coping and problem-solving skills as well as emphasize concepts emerging from the growing field of positive psychology (e.g., hope, optimism, self-compassion). Classroom discussions can be supplemented by additional online material and exercises designed to help promote key principles and themes among the students as well as their parents. Proactive prevention should occur at various points across the grade range with age-appropriate prevention efforts because it is likely that brief and time-limited interventions will have limited effectiveness. Still, there is evidence that interventions involving as few as six classroom lessons can reduce mental health stigma while increasing personal levels of functioning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0829573512468845">Naylor, Cowie, Walters, Talamelli, &amp; Dawkins, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>While it is readily apparent that the preventive interventions outlined above will require unprecedented levels of cooperation and commitment, including the allocation of very significant financial resources, it is also evident that the human cost of not addressing the mental health needs of our younger people is simply too heavy a cost to bear. Governments who feel unable to do so because of other financial pressures should recognize that these unprecedented measures to boost mental health will ultimately result in significant savings on the health care front as well, given mounting evidence of the link between psychological problems and physical health problems and the pervasive impacts of promoting wellness (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0829573512468845">Miller, Gilman, &amp; Martens, 2008</xref>). Most important, incorporating a greater focus on mental health promotion into the regular activities of our schools will give our students other valuable ways of learning about people and it will become a form of sensitivity training that fosters a much better understanding of the needs of people with mental health difficulties, including the struggles being faced by many of their peers.</p>
