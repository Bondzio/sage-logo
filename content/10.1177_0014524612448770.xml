<p>This book is a recent addition to the already extensive literature on the subjects of glossolalia and prophecy in New Testament studies. It takes as its focus the key Pauline text of 1 Corinthians and in particular chapter 14 verses 26-40. It seeks to understand the nature of the regulations expressed within these verses and then asks to what extent the regulations may be applied to other New Testament church contexts.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal, the author first of all considers the religious influences upon Christian inspired speech from both Hellenism and Judaism. He concludes that Christian glossolalia was probably unique, that the influence of Hellenistic practices was minimal and that there had been a revival in Jewish expectations concerning the restoration of prophecy during the New Testament period. With this background the study discusses glossolalia and prophecy in the New Testament texts themselves. He concludes that glossolalia existed in congregations outside Corinth (Acts 10.46 and 19.6) and possibly into the second century (Mark’s longer ending - 16.17). It can be classified functionally as ‘different kinds’ of speech, for example praise or prayer and only rarely unlearned human languages (as in Acts 2). The early church’s understanding of prophecy was consistent with Judaism in that it was regarded it as inspired speech for advancing God’s purposes in specific situations.</p>
<p>The heart of the book looks at the regulations in the context of the Corinthian congregational worship practices. There is an interaction with the most recent scholarship, with the author arguing that the injunction pertaining to women remaining silent being an important contextual element. This is because for Paul orderly worship is the key value and norm. The scope of the verses 14.36-40 are subsequently discussed, that is, whether the injunction refers only to tongues or to prophecy or to both, or whether it initiates a wider injunction concerning the silence of women in general. The scope of these regulations is subsequently explored in relation to the churches in Jerusalem, Caesarea, Antioch, Ephesus, Colossae, Rome, Thessalonica and Philippi. The author concludes that the principles of order, decency and edification are applicable beyond the Corinthian church and appear to be operational in these other contexts.</p>
<p>This is an important addition to the literature on the subject of New Testament glossolalia and prophecy. It offers a fresh perspective by taking 1 Corinthians 14.26-40 as a hermeneutical key and reads other passages in relation to it. My only reservation with this approach is that sometimes the evidence for glossolalic and prophetic practices in these other church contexts is rather limited. The author is on more solid ground when focusing on the Corinthian material. There are of course exegetical choices to be made, for example as to whether to follow Thiselton’s understanding of the ‘interpretation’ of glossolalia in Corinth or not. As always, not everyone will follow the various exegetical moves that are made. Nevertheless, this book deserves to be widely read and moves the discussion of the New Testament texts forward, which is to be commended.</p>

<p>This book is a thought-provoking collection of essays towards the goal of understanding that the right of a child to be loved is achieved first through teaching them to how to love others. It is an interesting and timely argument expressed well in several parts of the book though not as successfully developed in later chapters under the legal perspectives section of the volume.</p>
<p>As contributors to this volume are from several disciplines, the theme is interestingly explored from a variety of perspectives with use of history, political science, philosophy, psychology, sociology, statistics, law and theology. The book has an excellent preface by Stephen G. Post, which sets the theme and challenges the reader to really explore the idea of what is the ‘best love’ of the child. Then the editor, Timothy P. Jackson, develops further the theme of the volume working through different kinds of love by way of introducing the book and shedding insight into how the different chapters come together to form this collection.</p>
<p>Some of the chapters are particularly inspiring towards further thought and reflection. Robyn Fivush’s chapter regarding creating best love through shared family stories, though in the social-psychological perspectives part of the volume, could inspire some work in narrative theology. In the historical perspectives section, John Witte Jr. and Heather M. Johnson’s essay on the duties of love looking at the duties of children in the English-language household manual traditions of the fourteenth to nineteenth centuries gives an excellent insight into the historical precedence for a child’s right to love and be loved and towards understanding the ‘vocation of the child.’ This chapter gives the reader a lot to think about when comparing the relevance of the manual tradition’s teaching to modern day children and their current life circumstances.</p>
<p>The Philosophical and Theological Perspectives section of the book is the most clearly connected section to the theme of the volume. All three chapters are well developed and easy to read while still leaving the reader challenged to explore the ideas further. In particular, Martha J. Bunge’s essay regarding the ‘vocation’ of children and parents towards developing the best love for children is the highlight of the volume.</p>
<p>The book overall is a thoroughly interesting collection of essays. It has relevance to several disciplines of study whilst also being a challenge towards all readers to recognise the importance of the child in our midst and their right to be loved and be taught to love others. This book is excellent for further study or personal reflection.</p>

<p>Johnson’s book attempts to encourage a Christian reader to ‘recognize and claim both the violence of their religious past and the peace mandate of Jesus’ (p. 2). Set against the aftermath of the Twin Towers and its consequences for the Christian perception of Islam, it attempts to illustrate through examples Christianity’s own mixed legacy of peace and violence, and to challenge its tendency to overlook this legacy when responding to acts of violence perpetrated against it by other religious groups.</p>
<p>Johnson’s introduction is very promising, and sets its stall out quite nicely. His slightly too easy dismissal of Karl Marx (pp. 10-14) is discomfiting, and his dubious interpretations of certain Gospel passages are not ideal (pp. 24-29), but his general point – that Jesus provides a strong peace mandate, is not one that would be widely denied. There are, however, more significant problems with this book.</p>
<p>The first study is of Thomas Aquinas; like most readers, I had only ever thought of him as a theologian, but Johnson demonstrates that his theology was developed to resolve the Manichean heresy peacefully at a time when the wider church was bent upon bloody violence. Set in the context of such monstrosities as the Albigensian Crusade of 1209 where the people of Beziers and Marmande were slaughtered, Aquinas is presented as a peaceful man desperately striving to end such tragedies through non-violent means. It is therefore something of a shock to find, almost at the end of the chapter, that in the <italic>Summa Theologiae</italic> he explicitly advocates excommunication and death (presumably in that order) for heretics (pp. 65-66). Johnson explains this discrepancy in his conclusion, by saying that he finds it ‘difficult to imagine any public Christian response to violence from the Constantinian era that would not be ambivalent’ (p. 72). I agree with the sentiment, but it comes too late to save the chapter. Other chapters present different problems. The account of Ramon Lull is moderately interesting but is neither poignant nor really insightful. The chapter on Nicholas of Cusa, despite a dramatic and even moving opening, peters out into a long discussion of his theology. The chapter on Herbert of Cherbury describes his relationship to his mother for eleven pages (pp. 164-175).</p>
<p>The last chapter, on Thomas Jefferson, is a considerable improvement. It reads like a good story, and is well connected to the ideology of modern America. The epilogue includes a short account of André Trocmé and his work hiding Jews in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon during the Second World War. Again, it is interesting, even exciting, and feels very relevant. These latter sections benefit from their brevity, with Jefferson receiving only twenty seven pages, and Trocmé, about seven. They also benefit from what the other chapters lack – clear relevance to the stated purpose of the book.</p>
<p>For the most part, this book is a difficult one to recommend. It does not fulfil its own ambitions, and the very long theological discussions offer little reward in terms of insight or relevance. Nonetheless, the book is not without redeeming qualities, and I will not be entirely averse to reading any future monographs by Roger A. Johnson.</p>

<p>Given the attention that has been directed over the past decade to understand areas of confluence and divergence between the teachings of Stoicism and those of early Christianity— especially between Stoic luminaries such as Seneca and Epictetus and the writings contained within the Pauline corpus— there has been a welcome move in recent years to further the discussion by reflecting upon the works of the lesser known, or ‘minor’ Stoics. This volume, number twenty-eight in the <italic>SBL</italic>’s <italic>Writings from the Graeco-Roman World</italic> series, introduces one of their most notable members—Hierocles the Stoic (fl. 2<sup>nd</sup> century CE). Originally written in Italian by Ilaria Ramelli, David Konstan was responsible for translating the study into English, and can take credit for producing the first complete English rendering of Hierocles’ works. Though Konstan suggests (p. vii) that his more literal habit of translation might not match the elegance of Ramelli’s Italian translation, the text is eminently readable and characteristically clear. The study presents the reader with Hierocles’ <italic>Elements of Ethics, On Appropriate Acts</italic>, and several fragments of his writings that have been preserved in the <italic>Suda</italic>; with the Greek text being positioned on pages on the left-hand side and the English translation on the right. Key Greek terms are also helpfully bracketed next to their English equivalents.</p>
<p>Aside from the efforts of translation, a similarly notable and valuable achievement is the study’s detailing, and interaction with, previous scholarly deliberation on Hierocles’ thought. A large introduction (pp. xix-lxxxix) orients readers to the history of the transmission of Hierocles’ works and their interpretation, and extensive commentaries on his <italic>Elements of Ethics</italic> (pp. 35-62) and <italic>On Appropriate Acts</italic> (pp. 97-136) are provided. Throughout the study Ramelli’s concern and ability to place the key themes of Hierocles’ works within the broader context of Stoic/philosophical thought is apparent—especially with regards to the key concepts of <italic>oikeiosis</italic> (appropriation) and <italic>kathekonta</italic> (appropriate acts). Her expertise on the minor Stoics (e.g. see her <italic>Stoici Romani Minori: Testo Greco e Latino a Fronte</italic>) is also ably demonstrated, and her efforts to outline and distil recent advances in Italian scholarship on the minor Stoics, which have largely gone unattended to in English-language scholarship, is invaluable.</p>
<p>Overall, this work represents a notable achievement and will provide its readers with an indispensable resource to help them to better understand later-Stoic thought and the intellectual milieu in which early Christianity found itself.</p>

<p>This tightly edited volume about King David is both a <italic>Festschrift</italic> dedicated to David M. Gunn and a celebration of the 500<sup>th</sup> volume of the series JSOTS and LHBOTS. The articles all look at the portrayal of King David, in the Bible and in later post-biblical reception, in this way honouring Gunn’s own contributions in the areas of narrative criticism and biblical narratology.</p>
<p>The first part explores how the character of David develops throughout 1-2 Samuel. Jan Jaynes Quesada explores what the narratives in which David mourns someone’s death reveal about David’s character. Francis Landy analyzes David’s interaction with the two minor characters Ittai and Zadok. Mary Shields argues that Abigail’s actions resonate with Prov 1:9 and Nabal’s actions bring to mind Prov 9:13-18. David Penchansky adds feelings, actions, and motives to four narratives featuring Michal, David, and Jonathan. Randall C. Bailey uncovers hetero-sexual bias in many biblical interpretations and highlights how a number of texts about David, Saul, and Samuel open up possibilities for queer readings.</p>
<p>The second part looks at the portrayal of David in the Old and New Testament. Walter Brueggemann argues that reading 1 Kings 2:1-4 alongside 2 Kings 25:27-30 highlights the post-exilic views on the future of Davidic kingship. Danna Nolan Fewell suggests that the tragedy in the David narrative in 1-2 Sam enabled the post-exilic community, responsible for its preservation, to deal with its own social and theological trauma. Philip R. Davies proposes a degree of typology between Jesus and David, and between Saul/Paul (NT) and King Saul.</p>
<p>The third part investigates the connections between David and the Psalter. Carole R. Fontaine discusses the portrayal of David as a harper within the context of the Ancient Near East. Robert C. Culley explores one way of reading select individual lament psalms associated with David (Pss 142; 54; 56; 57; 59) in conjunction with narratives of danger and resolve featuring David. R. Christopher Heard highlights that both Ps 51 and 2 Sam 11-12 portray David as confessing his sins towards God whilst ignoring his sins against Uriah and Bathsheba. David J.A. Clines explores different methods for reading, using Ps 23 as a sample. For instance, he argues that the sheep metaphor runs through the entire psalm, with the inevitable result that the sheep ends his life as a sacrifice in the temple (v. 6).</p>
<p>The fourth part studies the portrayal of David in the arts. Yvonne Sherwood analyzes the ways in which the poet Theodore of Beza reformulated the biblical narrative about David and Bathsheba in the style of classical literature. Burke O. Long discusses the homoerotic aspects of Simeon Solomon’s paintings of David and Saul. David Jobling highlights that Bertolt Brecht’s projected play(s) about David portray David from multiple angles and imagine him at different stages in life. J. Cheryl Exum examines the portrayal of David in Children’s Bibles, with focus on the ways in which they depict David’s crimes of adultery and murder. Athalya Brenner retells creatively the story about Michal from five different perspectives (Saul’s, Paltiel’s, Jonathan’s, David’s, and Michal’s).</p>
<p>The fifth part explores the David narrative from a non-Euro-American perspective. Judith E. McKinlay offers a post-colonial reading of Michal in dialogue with Fiona Kidman’s novel <italic>The Book of Secrets</italic> about New Zealand. Jione Havea retells the story of David and Bathsheba in the form of a play, uttered by different voices representing different perspectives.</p>
<p>Taken together, this is an excellent collection of articles essential for anyone interested in the literary persona of King David.</p>

<p>‘The thing about heaven is that heaven is for people who like the sort of things that go on in heaven. Like, well, singing, talking to God, watering pot plants.’ So Edmund Blackadder counselled a dying penitent in the classic eponymous BBC sitcom of the 1980’s. Hopefully, few of us entertain so stereotyped a view of heaven. But we are probably still prone to think of it as a place of eternal bliss and relative stasis, the place we go to when we die, and therefore vastly distinct from our current earthly reality.</p>
<p>Christopher Morse offers a refreshing challenge to this view of heaven. Not just heaven though. His aim is to re-appraise how we understand the Christian gospel message, so often framed largely in terms of life after death. His survey of the biblical material on heaven, and especially of the way it relates to the ‘good news’ preached by Jesus in the Gospels, leads him to suggest that, ‘the heaven heard of in the context of this so-called “good news”…is less about a place we go to than one that comes to us, less about a post-mortem afterlife than about life here and now, and less about a timeless, static state than about a timely taking-place’ (p. 5). Heaven is therefore ‘that which is at hand and coming to pass’; it contrasts with our present world not so much because it is an entirely separate existence but because our present world is ‘that which is passing away’ (p. 6). And if we are inclined to think of the present world as ‘the real world’, then Morse points to heaven as the true reality which is breaking in, overarching and overtaking our present world (p. 36).</p>
<p>Key to Morse’s argument is the Synoptic Jesus’ message of ‘good news’ concerning the coming kingdom, and Morse’s tendency is to equate ‘heaven’ with this specific idea of the coming kingdom. It would be good to see a more careful exploration of this point though. Arguably heaven is not the same as the kingdom which comes from it, and there is a vast scholarly literature on the meaning of ‘kingdom’ which bears witness to the ambiguity inherent in these ideas, but which Morse does not acknowledge. Still, Morse does not claim to be giving us a thorough exploration of the biblical texts, more ‘notes scoring a hearing’ (p. 122), and if we accept it, it leads to a powerful hearing.</p>
<p>Notably, Morse makes the point that death, a fact of our present existence, becomes, not a pre-requisite for entry into heaven, but one of those things which is passing away, replaced by the arriving life from heaven. The raising of Lazarus, so often objected-to as a Johannine conjuring trick with little historical credence, becomes in Morse’s view one of the most potent illustrations of his view of heaven: ‘The “real world” is proclaimed to be one in which there is life currently arriving on the scene, in whatever situation we are facing, that is stronger than any undeniable loss threatening us, including death’ (p. 117).</p>
<p>In addition, Morse peruses theological thinking on heaven from the past century, emphasising ways in which the immediacy of heaven has been explored. Barth and Bonhoeffer loom large. For my money though, it is his exposition of the biblical material which is most immediate and most striking.</p>

<body>
<p>This is a splendid book that offers a judicious reading of five early Christian apologetic texts, each of which Nasrallah dates to the second century, and each of which she reads in the cultural context of the Second Sophistic. Thus she demonstrates with considerable panache the importance of reading these texts (the Acts of the Apostles, Justin’s <italic>Apologies</italic>, Athenagoras’ <italic>Embassy</italic>, Tatian’s <italic>To the Greeks</italic> and Clement of Alexandria’s <italic>Exhortation</italic>) as products of the wider intellectual world in which their early Christian authors lived, not just as products of early Christian discourse. For, as Nasrallah argues, these are texts that are as much a part of cultural and political debates about struggles in the Greek Roman Empire as about Christians versus pagans, or Christians versus imperial Rome. That said, I sometimes wondered quite who were the other readers whom she critiques for trying to read these texts as if they could be understood without reference to that wider world.</p>
<p>However although Nasrallah undoubtedly succeeds in reading her five texts as products of the Greek-speaking Roman Empire, I was less convinced of the extent to which she succeeds in showing how careful attention to the built environment, and especially the monumental architecture and statuary of the Roman Empire, sheds particular light on the particular texts to which most of her book is devoted. Her broader claim, that such archaeological evidence should be taken into account when seeking to interpret texts whose authors lived in a world where architectural artifacts could perhaps speak as eloquently and surely more visibly than literary texts, is certainly well made, and can hardly be rejected. Thus Nasrallah’s juxtaposition of particular material remains with particular literary texts is engaging, and worthy of considered reflection. Yet, to this reviewer at least, the force of these juxtapositions seems better able to give cumulative support to Nasrallah’s thesis that these texts should be read in the light of everything that we know about their contemporary context, including its archaeological as well as its literary remains, than it does to use a discussion of a particular monument or statue to cast light on a particular Christian text; the Christian responses that she maps are as much if not more responses to an empire-wide literary and material manifestation of the cultural claims and assumptions of the wealthy elite (for who else could pay for monumental architecture, and impose it on the communities among whom it was built?), not just to particular statuary and architecture by and through which those claims and assumptions were often expressed.</p>
<p>Such caveats notwithstanding, this is a stimulating monograph that helps bring alive both ancient written texts and also those sculpted in stone. It offers a stimulating discussion of the early Christian texts that she considers, read in the light of the ideal inhabitants of Roman public spaces to whom they were at least ostensibly directed, but it will be of more interest to readers whose primary interest is in early Christian apologetic literature rather than in Greek and Roman architecture and art.</p>

<p>This volume contains the papers presented at a conference held in Geneva from 13-14 June, 2008 focusing on the <italic>Refutation of All Heresies</italic> (ϰατὰ πασῶν αἱρέσϵων ἔλϵγχος; <italic>Refutatio omnium haeresium</italic> [<italic>Haer.</italic>]), often attributed to Hippolytus of Rome. The international character of the conference is evidenced by the articles, five of which are in French, four in English, three in Italian, and one in German. An introductory essay by Norelli offers a brief overview of the development of the idea of “heresies,” a short review of the debate surrounding the attribution of <italic>Haer.</italic>, and a summary of the ensuing essays. Winrich Löhr locates <italic>Haer.</italic> within the context of 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> century heresiologists and argues that it is the first text to combine two apologetic discourses: that Christian truth is older and more revered than pagan philosophy and that heresy is a novelty. Bernard Pouderon analyzes the foundational ideas in the arguments set forth in <italic>Haer.</italic>, e.g., tradition, novelty, dependence, imitation, etc. Aragione argues that in <italic>Haer.</italic> an ἔλϵγχος is not a refutation in the strict sense of the word, but rather an unveiling, denunciation, and denigration of heresy. Two essays consider the attitude toward and use of philosophers in <italic>Haer.</italic>, with Abraham P. Bos focusing on the portrayal of Basilides as a proponent of Aristotelianism and Angela Longo studying the comparison made between Marcion and Empedocles. The presentation in <italic>Haer.</italic> of Christianity as a cultivated religion of intellectuals is set forth by Clemens Scholten. Guillaume Duccoeur argues for a two-stage redaction of <italic>Haer.</italic>, with the author of a short initial work expanding it under the influence and inspiration of the arrival of Hippolytus in the author’s community. Giulia Sfameni Gasparro considers the manner in which <italic>Haer.</italic> connects astronomy/astrology with heresy. Emanuele Castelli, arguing that Porphyry already knows the attribution of <italic>De Universo</italic> to Josephus, contends that this work, also written by the unknown author of <italic>Haer.</italic>, is a previously unnoticed instance of Christian pseudepigraphy. Norelli focuses on <italic>Haer.</italic> 10.31-34 in studying the opposition between orthodoxy and heresy in 3<sup>rd</sup> century Rome. The final two chapters continue the long-running debate between Manlio Simonetti and Allen Brent concerning the ecclesiological context of <italic>Haer.</italic>, in particular the question of whether a monarchical episcopate already existed at the time the author wrote. Overall, the reader is offered admirable insight into the discussions surrounding the manner in which the author of <italic>Haer.</italic> ‘constructs’ the phenomenon of heresy and the intellectual, social, and ecclesiastical context in which the work appeared. A concluding bibliography of works from 1940–2010 by Aragione is helpful as an entry point into relevant literature; however, it is also curiously selective. For example, it does not list Mark Santer’s notice on <italic>Haer.</italic>10.33.9 (<italic>JTS</italic> 24 [1973]: 194-95) but does list Miroslav Marcovich’s short notice on the same passage (<italic>JTS</italic> 24 [1973]: 195-96), which is, in part, a response to Santer. In addition, there is no mention of the contribution by Ulrich Volp on Hippolytus that appeared in the pages of this journal (<italic>ExpTim</italic> 120 [2009]: 521-29).</p>

<p>The idea for the series of which Grant Osborne’s Matthew commentary is part was refined through pastors and teachers sharing what they wanted in a commentary series. Osborne himself says that he was excited at the criteria for coverage being what the pastor needs rather than what scholars would like to have, stating that the exegetical and theological details he chose to include were on the basis of one question, what he would want to know as a pastor preparing a sermon on the passage. Towards that end, chapters of the commentary’s main section, which is preceded by a brief introduction and select bibliography and followed by indices and a section on Matthean theology, are divided into seven sections: literary context, main idea, translation, structure and literary form, exegetical outline, explanation of the text, and theology in application. In the introduction, Osborne opts for the apostle Matthew as author, a preferable date of 65-67 CE, the genre of gospel (defined as theological biography of Christ), and sources of Mark, Q, and M, among other positions.</p>
<p>If a commentary is to be judged on its stated purpose, Osborne’s work is a success, partly due to the clear and homiletically enabling seven section format, and partly due to Osborne’s not wading so deep into the scholarly literature and conversation that the reader loses his sense of footing. As a seasoned Gospels scholar, Osborne’s familiarity with this literature and conversation shows in his exegesis and in his presentation of different views on major issues. But in keeping with the need to limit the commentary’s scope and thus make it of easier use for pastors and teachers, Osborne gives little or no argument for his positions on some minor issues. The result is a very large volume that is academically respectable and would be of great help for pastors wanting to use their sermon preparation time efficiently.</p>
<p>One caution, though, is in order. It is against overreliance on the genre of works that compromise thoroughness and breadth of coverage for usability and helpfulness. The time demands of the pastorate can be great and often leave far less time for study and sermon preparation than pastors would like, making Osborne’s commentary a valuable tool for the pastor. But the patient and meticulous sifting of evidence, possibilities, and arguments that is found, for example, in Davies and Allison’s three-volume Matthew commentary cultivates a sort of historical and exegetical rigor that this commentary generally does not. This is not a fault of Osborne. It stems from the aim of the commentary, which he realizes. But the ability to work through and appreciate the depth and extent of argumentation and evaluation of evidence that is found in more academic commentaries is important even for pastors, if only as a check against an uncritical presumptuousness in interpretation. This suggests that, as good as Osborne’s commentary is, it should not be the only commentary used in the pastor’s sermon preparation.</p>

<p><italic>God’s Transforming Work</italic> is both a tribute to Bishop David Stancliffe and a series of reflections on Common Worship (which owes so much to his influence and inspiration). The combination may not be entirely helpful as it is sometimes hard to gauge what the book is seeking to do and in honouring Bishop Stancliffe some critical edge may be missing.</p>
<p>By and large however this is an interesting collection of essays which occasionally catches fire – Richard Giles offers a typically stimulating and feisty analysis of two cathedrals, Philadelphia and Portsmouth, and the creation of a sacred space in which the liturgy of journey can be experienced. Jeremy Davies shares with Giles in the presumption that the Easter Liturgy is the touchstone for the wider liturgical project. Not surprisingly, given the book’s subtitle, most of the contributors share the view that the model of diversity within a common structure is a development to be welcomed. The theological consequences of that diversity are on the whole only dealt with <italic>en passant</italic>, although what does emerge from these pages, explicitly or by inference, is an acknowledgement that Anglican theology – traditionally articulated in worship and the life of prayer – is being or has been, subtly transformed by the Common Worship project.</p>
<p>However only Angela Tilby’s piece on the concept of original sin in the baptismal rite, challenges the theological assumptions of the new liturgies and perhaps the collection might have benefitted from the inclusion of some contributors who were prepared to offer a wider and more robust critique.</p>
<p>Anxiety about the Church’s investment in its worship is though, very evident. Peter Moger and Gilly Meyers stress the critical need for dedicated resources focussed on the training of clergy and other practitioners, in the underlying principles as well as in the planning and delivery of worship.</p>
<p>At the heart of the book and the implication of its title is the importance of recognising the transforming power of liturgy in the hearts and lives of worshippers. It is this that makes liturgy a so significant but sometimes underrated element of mission.</p>
<p>Rowan Williams in his introduction typically gets to the heart of the matter setting the issue against the wider backdrop of a church in which diversity is being stretched to the limits and in which large parts of the church have seemingly little interest or engagement in liturgical renewal. The crucial difference however, he argues, is not the obvious cultural distinctions between contemporary and traditional styles of worship, but between liturgy – as life transforming and inclusive - and ritual as formalised and exclusive. All kinds of churches can fall into that trap. If there is a crisis for liturgy it is that many are failing to see it for what it is – the power to express and shape a new set of relationships with God and the world.</p>

<body>
<p>In common with much of Polkinghorne’s writing in the science-religion field, this book is couched in the tone of apologetic, attempting to present a reasonable defence of the Christian faith and of relatively traditional Christian beliefs in the light of modern science. And in common with Polkinghorne’s other books, this one focuses predominantly on the particular challenges of twentieth-century physics, especially relativity, quantum mechanics, cosmology, and chaos theory. In fact, Polkinghorne sees this present volume as a survey of the most important debates in the contemporary dialogue between science and theology, concentrating on his own contributions and interests. That it is very much guided by Polkinghorne’s own interests is clear from the fact that the discussion of science is totally dominated by physics, with the (very significant) challenges from biology being restricted mostly to brief sections on evolution, consciousness, and the problem of evil. Still, Polkinghorne has made the science manageable and accessible.</p>
<p>In addition to discussions of the scientific challenges, Polkinghorne also runs through his own approaches to core Christian beliefs (e.g. Christ, resurrection, eschatology, Scripture, Holy Trinity) and some of the more difficult problems which are often raised for religious belief (e.g. the problem of evil, a good God in a suffering world, belief in Christianity in a world of many faiths).</p>
<p>The title makes it clear that ‘truth’ and different methodologies are at stake, and in the opening chapter Polkinghorne presents a basic discussion of the problems lying behind the question of realism in science, and the particular solution of ‘critical realism’ which he draws on so frequently in his other work. He also makes some comparison with the methods of theology, and points out that, although ‘truth’ is every bit as central in the theological task, yet it is sought in ways which both compare and contrast with those in science. An illustration comes in the Postscript at the end, where Polkinghorne gives a sensitive assessment of the relationship between Christianity and other faiths in light of the search for ‘truth’. This is all well said, and combined with Polkinghorne’s clear apologetic tone throughout his book makes for a balanced and mature view of the interaction between the two disciplines. Which is why I was all the more surprised to be unable to detect any engagement with the shrill but persistent voice of New Atheism. There is a brief dismissal of those who assume science is omnicompetent (p. 21) and of scientism (p. 23), but without any sense that we have here the key <italic>public</italic> debate of our times in science and religion. Polkinghorne’s has always been a relatively gentle voice when compared to the biting and tearing of much modern polemic in this area. But his reluctance to engage with the critics in the context of this introductory overview of critical debate in the field, comes across as strangely out-of-touch, especially given the title of this book.</p>
<p>Still, there is much here that will be of use to a reader who is already sympathetic to religious faith and is interested in the impact of physics on faith. It is particularly useful as a straightforward and introductory overview of Polkinghorne’s main contributions to science and theology.</p>

<p>The link between missionary activity overseas and anti-slavery legislation at home has long been recognized; but those between anti-slavery legislation and wider movements for political reform have received less attention. In part this is because of the exaggerated focus on the Anglican, William Wilberforce, in the anti-slavery agitation, which ignores the wider petitioning movement from the provinces. But it is also because those with their eyes fixed on political agitation forget that their agitators had other interests. Those who attended a meeting to campaign against the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts might the next week be going to the local London Missionary society auxiliary: both activities reflected a single commitment to religious liberty.</p>
<p>Dr Rutz’s book is a study of Congregationalism, and therefore of the London Missionary Society. A similar story for the Baptist Missionary Society is buried in the pages of Professor Stanley’s bicentenary history of that Society of nearly twenty years ago. It would be useful to develop a more broadly-based history of the role of radical Dissent in the colonial setting to parallel the long-established work on radical Dissent in the political sphere. The value of this book lies in the detail, which a particular study makes possible. It is organized around six chapters: the first two discuss the Evangelical Revival and the origins of the Missionary Movement, and then Itinerancy and the rise of Evangelical Politics; the second pair is concerned with the Missionary Movement and the politics of Abolition on the one hand, and Missionary Politics in Britain and the Cape Colony; while the final two consider the post-Abolition period with Dissenting Politics in the 1830s and finally Church, Race and Conflict in the Cape Missions in the same period. Despite the title’s terminal date the discussion of the 1840s is very brief, although there is a concluding mention of the Xhosa uprising of 1851.</p>
<p>The book is well-argued and clearly set out. It adds to the volume of material which shows that the missionaries of radical Dissent were not uncritical supporters of colonialism in general and white settlers in particular. The development of racism owed more to the development of ‘scientific’ studies of anthropology in the early nineteenth century than it did to the Bible. I remain intrigued, however, by whether ‘the British Zion’ of the title was a place or a dream of men like Johannes van der Kemp, John Smith and John Philip. I was also struck by the coincidence that both in Demerara and in Cape Colony the L.M.S. was working in former Dutch colonies, where missionaries came from a strongly conservative Reformed Christian tradition with a very different view of Africans and African Christians. Was this because of their politics, or their Christianity, or are they just sinners? This crossover between historical and theological questions remains largely untackled by most authors.</p>

<p>As the title suggests, Stone aims to open up new vistas for research into the Second Temple period and beyond by treating a variety of topics and methodological issues. Due to the broad focus of this work, there is no single thesis. Instead, each of the seven chapters represents a self-contained study of one or more relevant matters. A brief summary of the contents demonstrates its scope.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 is perhaps the most significant. It questions the assumptions with which scholars use ancient texts in order to reconstruct Judaism of the Second Temple period. Stone emphasizes the importance of understanding most texts as reflections of the dominant forms of Judaism and Christianity that transmitted them. By implication, some of the complexity of ancient Judaism has been muted or gone unrepresented in the available data, and the texts are not necessarily indicative of what was acceptable to Judaism of the Second Temple period itself. Thus, Stone suggests that one should consider what the data are not revealing (p. 24). Chapter 2 deals with the pseudepigrapha at Qumran that explain evil and suffering as a direct effect of demonic intervention, rather than as the result of Adamic sin. Chapter 3 underscores the innovation of apocalyptic historiography, which views history comprehensively from start to finish and organizes it into several standard structures. In chapter 4, which is largely a consideration of pseudepigraphy, Stone presents a cogent argument that the stereotyped nature of pseudepigraphic visionary experiences does not eliminate the strong possibility that they represent actual religious experiences of their authors. Chapter 5 probes the question of the status of certain literary delimitations in the Second Temple period, and concludes that Judaism did not speak in terms of canon, but in terms of authoritative texts that were written with the holy spirit. Chapter 6 presents the phenomenon of ‘textual clusters’, which are texts that stand in some relationship with each other that cannot be described with the conventional tools of literary- and text criticism. Chapter 7 considers the sources that have survived from ancient Judaism, and addresses the significance of the fact that these were transmitted in Greek, and by Christians. Finally, Stone discusses the broadening chronological focus of pseudepigrapha studies and the challenges that come along with this development.</p>
<p>Although this monograph will be stimulating reading for all who are interested in ancient Judaism and the pseudepigrapha, its primary significance may be in the shape that it gives to future research. Stone challenges some of the methodological assumptions that are normally at play in studies of ancient Judaism and early Christianity, and he repeatedly raises research questions that perhaps only a senior scholar with his level of expertise would think to ask in the first place. Therefore, students and scholars will find both methodological guidance and fruitful avenues for further research in this book.</p>

<p>This hefty tome represents a collaborative research effort based predominantly at Baylor University (three of the four editors are on the teaching staff there, whilst many Baylor undergraduates and doctoral students are credited for their assistance with the project in the Editor’s Preface) with the intention to ‘recover Baptist interpretations of canonical Acts over the past four centuries of Baptist history’ (p. 1).</p>
<p><italic>The Acts of the Apostles</italic> is a commentary of Baptist interpretations of Acts from the seventeenth to the twenty-first century, with a particular focus on the selection of interpretations that either ‘shed light on the biblical text’ or ‘illuminate the traditional markers of Baptist identity’ (p. 22). The over-riding aim is to enable the reader ‘in just a few minutes’ to obtain ‘a sense of the ‘Baptist reception’ of a particular passage’ (p. 23).</p>
<p>The commentary, which forms the main body of the work, is preceded by an Editorial Introduction as well as a thoroughly enjoyable essay on Helen Barrett Montgomery, whose translation of the text of Acts as it appears in the <italic>Centenary Translation of the New Testament</italic> (published in 1924 to commemorate the centenary of the American Baptist Publication Society) provides the working text for each section of interpretation.</p>
<p>The sections adhere to the conventional chapter groupings of Acts and each follows a similar pattern. First, there is an ‘Overview’ of the chapter(s) in question, which highlights the dominant foci of Baptist interpretations and sketches the development of these interpretations across the centuries. Secondly, this is followed by Montgomery’s translation of the text, which includes her original passage divisions and headings, as well as any footnotes, comments in brackets, etc. Thirdly, after the scriptural passage(s) the various Baptist interpretations are given. These appear in chronological order of century and year; title, name, article and page numbers are given as appropriate, as well as scriptural references both to Acts as well as to any other biblical texts which may be applicable (although the formatting of the various scriptural references makes them rather difficult to unpick). Some entries (in particular the earlier interpretive material) are preceded by a brief introductory paragraph, contextualising the text, document or person in question. The commentary is followed by a biographical bibliography and an index of references to Acts, so that the reader is able to search either by verse or by person.</p>
<p>The chief strength of <italic>The Acts of the Apostles</italic> lies in the sheer breadth and variety of material incorporated in the commentary. There is a particular emphasis on gathering together and uncovering the debates and views expressed in the earliest interpretive material from the seventeenth century, and later material is included as it relates to the concerns of the former. The interpretive material includes Baptist confessions, commentaries, academic works, works of popular theology, as well as hymns and letters. The geographical scope of the material and its commentators ranges from Europe to the United States, from China to Africa and Australia. This book is indeed an impressive achievement and a valuable resource.</p>
