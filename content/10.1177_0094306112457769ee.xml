<p>Globalization is a multifaceted and contradictory process led by powerful elites and institutions. Its general characteristics are the compression of time and space through new and always evolving information and communication technologies, and the concentration of wealth. The main process is the subject of different narratives, depending on the dimension that one chooses. One of these is the macroeconomic narrative of advanced (sometimes called “late”) capitalism, characterized by runaway financial flows. Another is a geopolitical story in which power shifts from West to East.</p>
<p>The topic of this book is a process that accompanies globalization like a shadow, as the mainstream generates contradictory eddies: counter-movements driven by activists from different walks of life, and in different sites. These activists resist and oppose aspects of globalization perceived as destructive and unfair. They also seek different ways of organizing social life to remedy the dysfunctions of the current ones. The overall social movement they compose is in constant flux. Sometimes it seems to approach unity, and other times it splinters into squabbling parts. This is the story of alter-globalization—the phenomenology of the formation of new actors and new modes of action in the global theater.</p>
<p>The book is timely because the alter-globalization movement, which began to grow under neo-liberalism during its heyday, and entered into apparent remission after 9/11, has emerged anew after the world financial crisis. Since the publication of this book there has been a resurgence of insurgence: a massive and extended contestation of the status quo both <italic>urbi</italic> (as in Occupy Wall Street) and <italic>orbi</italic> (as in Tahrir Square). The Arab Spring, the London riots, the Moscow demonstrations, and many other manifestations of discontent from Tunisia to Tel Aviv to Oakland are indications that the hitherto integrated global system is breaking down; or alternatively, that we are in the first stages of what has been called a Big Shift in which a new awareness among many actors, old and new, will produce a less cataclysmic yet fundamental reconfiguration of talents, resources, and opportunities.</p>
<p>Multiple activists attack a state of affairs rather than a single system run by an inimical elite (the defamed one percent is only a vague candidate). This challenge to the status quo does not resemble past social movements that tended towards coherence, organization, and were led by an avant-garde. It is diverse, horizontal, and it rejects top-down leadership. Those who seek to understand and study these new phenomena will find in this book many descriptions, concepts, and analytical perspectives that are useful and perceptive.</p>
<p>If the book is timely, it is also very French. The narrative of alter-globalization offered by Geoffrey Pleyers is parsed, as in Proust’s great novel <italic>In Search of Lost Time</italic>, into two streams: the “way of subjectivity,” and “the way of reason.” They follow separate courses, as per another Frenchman’s dictum (Blaise Pascal: “The heart has its reasons, which reason does not know”), but they sometimes meet and intertwine. Pleyers’ dichotomy has a long pedigree in philosophy and social theory: experience vs. thought (Kant), life vs. form (Simmel), subjective understanding vs. objective explanation (Dilthey, Weber), existential vs. propositional truth (Wolff), <italic>Gemeinschaft</italic> vs. <italic>Gesellschaft</italic> (Toennies), and mechanical vs. organic solidarity (Durkheim).</p>
<p>Among the activists studied by Pleyers, “subjectivity” means the feeling of interactions that are bound by strong ties (as in friendship, comradeship, team-work) and by mutual pleasure (games, love, sports, art). How and where is this subjectivity rooted? Does it stem from prior experiences or is it a novelty, an object of discovery and desire? According to his findings there is a bit of each. Globalization throws together the old and the new, the similar and the disparate. It generates a syntagmatic and a syncretic experience. But if such experience is increasingly the everydayness of globalization, what distinguishes the specific subjectivity of the alter-globalizers? Whereas the kaleidoscope of globalized experience normally appears as an alienated phantasmagoria run by puppeteers, the activists speak of relations in which they are in control, playful yet reconciled with each other and the environment. This different everydayness raises a question that the book answers only in part. Is this subjectivity transient and ephemeral or embedded and sustained? Herein lies the book’s weakest point. Pleyers’ field report does not offer a thick description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306112457769">Geertz 1993</xref>) of how the activists live and interact. It merely quotes from their stated desires and dreams. It does not tell us if their bonded solidarity is a fleeting product of demonstrations, conventions, and street occupations, which by their very nature come and go, or if it is rooted in more silent but sustainable alternative ways of life. To find the latter, we must search elsewhere, as for instance in the data gathered in Gar Alperovitz’s book <italic>America Beyond Capitalism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306112457769">2003</xref>). There we find reports of rural co-ops and credit unions, urban farms, staff-owned companies, public banks, “green” services, nonprofit investments, and regional public-option health care plans. These may one day transform the social landscape of societies that have been utterly colonized by the logic of the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094306112457769">Habermas 1987</xref>). It behooves the sociologist to distinguish between a history of events and deeper and longer structural shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306112457769">Braudel 1958</xref>). To fail this task is to fall prey to media-driven avatars of carnavalesque happenings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306112457769">Bahktin 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Pleyers correctly points out that despite the erratic flashpoints of the movement, such actions have an impact on the public consciousness. In effect, for the first time in 100 years, the virtues and demerits of capitalism are openly discussed in the opening season of the U.S. presidential election. But the much touted “1 vs. 99 percent” buzzword does not plumb the depths of social complexity in a no-holds-barred capitalist system. Among the 99 percent, most people juggle a contradictory role set that pits their interests as investors and consumers against their interests as workers and citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094306112457769">Reich 2012</xref>). Complicity runs deep in the “runaway” globalized world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094306112457769">Giddens 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In substance as well as method, Pleyers’ contribution follows in the footsteps of Alain Touraine’s pioneering work on the social movements of post-industrial society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094306112457769">Touraine 1981</xref>). From 1999 to 2009, Pleyers conducted field research on 250 activist meetings, 800 lectures, many protest actions, and held over 150 semi-structured interviews with activists. His is an ambitious qualitative research, and should therefore be judged on the richness of description and the quality of inference, where it shows the weakness mentioned above. In Gertrude Stein’s words, there is not much “there” there. The book would have benefitted also from a complement of hard quantitative data on standard sociological variables, including class, work status, and phase of the life cycle.</p>
<p>On a more basic level, one wonders if alter-globalization is one movement or many. This difficulty points to a fundamental ambiguity of the global age, in which instant communication, mutual awareness, and imitation produce the illusion of unity of social processes that are rooted in very different structures and path dependencies, from the mountains of Chiapas to the street <italic>piquetes</italic> in Buenos Aires and New York. In short, simultaneity may well mask differences and hide distinct destinies.</p>
<p>Pleyers is more comfortable reporting on “the way of Reason,” that is on the propositional, technical, and more generally intellectual critiques of capitalist globalization spun by dissident scientists, political economists (professional and amateur), pamphleteers, and reconditioned radicals, from Marxists to environmentalists and egalitarians of all stripes. There is clearly an elective affinity between these activists of reason and the sociological observer. Pleyers notes the tension between the elitism of the “thinking” activists and the protesters on the streets, leading to mutual distrust and suspicion. This seems an instance of the classic tension between movements and institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306112457769">Alberoni 1984</xref>). Heart and reason do not march together for long. Pleyers is at his best in the analysis of this conflict inside the alter-globalization movement. In the opinion of this reviewer, such conflicting strands are no match for the smooth confluence of thought and action found in the once-hegemonic form of neo-liberal globalization—a successful social movement led by elites during thirty years. Now that it looks as if neo-liberalism has run its course, the resulting cracks and fissures give breathing space to alternative movements and hybrid experiments. Pleyers’ book opens up some vistas of these developments in the middle of a serious crisis, and does it from the ground up.</p>
