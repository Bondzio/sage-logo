<body>
<p>Stephen R Covey’s book is published by Free Press, New York, and is priced at fifteen dollars in India. This self-help book is written in easily understandable English. The foreword to the book gives a glimpse about the high feelings of the world’s renowned and effective managers about the book.</p>
<p>The book suggests habits which each one of us can develop to be an effective human being. According to Covey, these habits are found in people of all the major religions in the world. His view is that all highly effective people and enduringly effective organizations, have utilized these habits, to a greater or lesser extent, to attain and sustain their success.</p>
<p>Covey illustrates his point by diagrams, charts, continuum bars, like the circle of concern, the circle of influences, the upward spiral, etc., which make the understanding even easier. Covey repeatedly drives home the point he wishes to emphasize to the reader with numerous real-life examples. Sometimes, Covey uses himself as an example. Each chapter finishes with suggestive doing to managers in their organization or personal life.</p>
<p>Of the seven habits, the first three are habits of independence and the rest are habits of inter-dependence. The first habit emphasizes that the person has to be proactive instead of reactive. Being proactive means taking charge of situations. We human beings are responsible for our own lives. The exemplification of proactiveness by the two circles—the circle of influence and of concern—is outstanding. According to the author, proactive people focus their efforts in the circle of influence. Reactive people focus their efforts in the circle of concern. It is not possible to form the other habits without being pro-active in our efforts.</p>
<p>The second habit is to ‘begin with the end in mind’. It means ‘knowing where you’re going so that you better understand where you are now and take steps in the right direction’.</p>
<p>Covey lists the third habit as ‘put first things first’. This is about organizing and implementing activities in line with the aims established in habits one and two. The time management matrix is superbly depicted. The top of the matrix divides the blocks into things that are ‘urgent’ and not ‘urgent’, and the left side divides the matrix into ‘important’ and ‘not important’. Spending less time in Quadrant III and IV will give us more time to spend in Quadrant II, so that we can put first things first, with the added benefit that we will also be finding ourselves dealing with fewer Quadrant I crises. I love Covey’s example of steward delegation. He tells his son to take care of the lawn to make it green and clean. He does not dictate to his son but rather gives him the vision. His vision finally bears fruit when his son completes the task. Covey summarizes that if steward delegation is done correctly both parties will benefit and more work can be done in less time.</p>
<p>The fourth habit is to ‘think win/win’ which is fundamental to success in all our interactions. ‘Win/win’ means that agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial and satisfying. In cases where a ‘win/win’ deal cannot be achieved, accept the fact that agreeing to make ‘no deal’ may be the best alternative.</p>
<p>The fifth habit is the most important principle of interpersonal relations, viz., ‘first to understand, then to be understood’. Communication is the most important skill in our life. Most people do not listen with the intent to understand, they listen with the intent to reply. Empathetic listening is a must before projecting your own autobiography.</p>
<p>Habit six is ‘to synergize’. It states that effectiveness is an inter-dependent reality which depends on team work, team building and the development of unity and creativity with other human beings. Through mutual trust and understanding, one often can solve conflicts and find a better solution than would have been obtained through either person’s own solution.</p>
<p>Finally, the seventh habit is to ‘sharpen the saw’. It means one has to renew four dimensions of nature, viz. physical, spiritual, mental and social. The physical dimension that includes exercise, nutrition and stress management. The mental dimension includes reading, visualizing, planning and writing. The social/emotional dimension includes service, empathy, synergy and intrinsic security. Finally, the spiritual dimension includes value clarification and commitment, study and meditation. The author states that it is highly necessary to maintain a balance among these dimensions.</p>
<p>After discussing all effective habits, there is a chapter ‘Inside Out Again’ where the author shares his personal story which summarizes all the principles. Appendices and indices at the back of the book are novel as they aid in quick reference.</p>
<p>All seven habits are very true and practical for their application in our life to be successful. Targeted toward anyone who is interested in personal change, it guides him through private victory, public victory and renewal.</p>
<p>Covey’s seven habits are as tough to institute as they can be to break. One can not apply these ideas half-heartedly. Covey’s teachings are not a quick fix by any means, but can lead to positive change.</p>
<p>Knowledge without application is useless! Initially you may read through it once to have a sense of it, but you will need to go back time and again to reinforce these habits and thus be effective. Discuss what you read each time as you go through this book.</p>
<p>Finally, I must say it’s a ‘must-read’ book for all managers if one can get hold of it. If you’d rather listen than read, an audio version is also available on CD accompanying the book.</p>
