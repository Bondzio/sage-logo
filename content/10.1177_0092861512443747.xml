            <p>In a multiregional clinical trial (MRCT), determining whether regional differences occur by chance or whether they are due to differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or other prognostic factors is important to accurately evaluate the true efficacy of a drug in patients of each region. The general probability that regional results will differ from total results has been studied using statistical simulation. Consideration from the pharmacokinetic perspective is necessary as well to investigate the causes of regional differences. Patient characteristics may vary among regions, and differences in medical environment such as commonly used drugs and treatment guidelines can affect regional efficacy and safety results. Moreover, bias may be introduced in the data collected due to differences such as in diagnosis, assessment criteria, and reporting conditions. In this research, the factors and mechanism potentially influencing results by region in MRCT are examined, referring to the results of MRCTs already published.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Globalization of new drug development is progressing, together with an increase in the number of multiregional clinical trials (MRCT) being conducted. In the past, the United States and countries in Europe were the main countries represented in MRCTs. Recently, however, this has expanded to include countries and regions such as central and eastern Europe, Latin and South America, and the Asia-Pacific region. With the expansion of MRCT in geography, we are now faced with the new challenge of observing unexpected differences in efficacy and safety among regions in an MRCT. The Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF)<sup>

            </sup> has highlighted the general risk that efficacy may not be demonstrated for a region in an MRCT.</p>
         <p>In an MRCT that includes multiple races, ethnicities, or cultures, it is possible that differences in efficacy and safety can be observed among countries or regions. Determining whether differences occur by chance or whether they are due to differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or other prognostic factors is important to accurately evaluate the true efficacy of a drug in patients of each region. If different findings are due to differences in a prognostic factor, it will be possible to eliminate the effect of that factor in the study planning and implementation stage by identifying the factor and the mechanism of effect beforehand. In this research, the factors potentially influencing results by region are summarized, referring to the results of MRCTs already published in review reports from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). This can contribute to the better planning, execution, and interpretation of MRCTs in the future.</p>

As a precondition for bridging, differences and similarities in various intrinsic and extrinsic factors need to be examined to determine whether bridging is possible. As with bridging, it is also necessary to analyze whether these factors vary among regions to assess the feasibility of conducting an MRCT.</p>

         <p>The RENAAL study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study to assess the effect of losartan to slow progression of renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512443747">Table 1</xref> gives the incidence of primary end point events and hazard ratio by region and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512443747">Table 2</xref> by country in Asia.

         <p>In the PMDA review reports related to these 3 studies, a detailed discussion on the regional differences observed is presented. Based on these discussions, the potential factors and mechanisms introducing regional differences are summarized in the following section.</p>

      <sec id="section3-0092861512443747">
         <title>Potential Factors and Mechanism Influencing Regional Differences and Similarities in MRCT</title>
         <p>The factors potentially introducing regional differences in efficacy and safety results in MRCT have been classified for this research as chance variability, factors influencing pharmacokinetics (drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion), and differences between regions in the patients’ characteristics, the medical environment, and the study operation and assessment. These factors are not limited to MRCT but can be recognized as potential factors associated with regional differences in MRCT.</p>
         <sec id="section4-0092861512443747">
            <title>Chance Variability</title>
            <p>In an MRCT, the results by country or region have insufficient power and vary due to the small sample size as in the case of other subgroup analysis. In the tadalafil study, the Japanese subgroup consisted of only about 5 patients per group, whereas the total population consisted of approximately 80 patients per group, and it is thought that dose response was not detected in the Japanese population due to the large variability with a small sample size. When the results in 1 region differ from the total population, determining whether the difference is due to chance is difficult. The general probability of having regional results different from total results has been studied using statistical simulation. Marschner<sup>

               </sup> calculated the probability that 1 or more regions have a treatment effect favoring the control arm for different numbers of regions, assuming a 2-arm multinational clinical study. For example, there is about a 50% chance to observe regional treatment effects favoring the control in an MRCT with 5 regions.</p>
            <p>The PMDA has provided criteria to calculate the Japanese sample size necessary to control variability in <italic>Basic Principles on Global Clinical Trials</italic>.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512443747">12</xref>
               </sup> Method 1 aims to identify a sample size to show that the point estimate of treatment effect for Japanese patients is at least π times that for the total population. Method 2 aims to calculate the sample size for each region to show that all regional point estimates of treatment effect are in the same direction as the total population. The aim of method 1 is to obtain results in Japanese patients (1 region) that are consistent with the total population, whereas with Method 2, the aim is to obtain results consistent across all regions.</p>

         <sec id="section5-0092861512443747">
            <title>Differences and Similarities in Pharmacokinetics</title>
            <p>Differences in drug efficacy can depend on the degree of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; the transfer of drug to target tissues; and the degree of reaction at the target tissue. Consideration from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic perspectives is therefore necessary to investigate the causes of regional differences in an MRCT. Since pharmacodynamics at the target tissue or organ is dependent on the specific disease and drug and is not fully known, pharmacokinetics is the focus of this research.</p>
            <sec id="section6-0092861512443747">
               <title>Food</title>
               <p>During new drug development, the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the drug is usually investigated. Diet varies among regions, and the speed of absorption of a drug may differ between a region where a high-fat meal is generally taken and a region where a low-fat meal is the norm, leading to differences in drug concentrations among regions and hence to differences in efficacy and safety. Although controlling for food across regions in an MRCT is not necessary from the standpoint of generalizability of results, it is meaningful to investigate differences in diet and its effect on pharmacokinetics prior to the initiation of an MRCT.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="section7-0092861512443747">
               <title>Body Weight and Size</title>
               <p>In phase 1 clinical studies in healthy volunteers, the body weight of the Western subjects is generally 20% to 30% higher than in Japanese subjects. The difference in body size is pharmacokinetically associated with a difference in distribution volume, resulting in possible difference in drug concentrations. Although body size is a difference that occurs between individuals, a situation can occur in which body weight distribution in a region is in a lower range than in other regions in an MRCT, resulting in patients in the region having a higher treatment effect and more adverse events on average due to higher drug concentrations.</p>

               <title>Genetic Polymorphism in Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes</title>
               <p>Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme that has many isozymes, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, some of which exhibit genetic polymorphism. When a drug metabolized by a particular isozyme is administered to a patient lacking that isozyme (poor metabolizer), the drug may not be adequately metabolized, resulting in high drug concentrations. For example, 20% of the Japanese population are reported to lack CYP2C19.<sup>

                  </sup> If an MRCT with a drug metabolized mainly by CYP2C19 is conducted, it is possible that a higher treatment effect and more adverse events may be reported in Japanese patients due to the higher percentage of poor metabolizers than in other regions. Although CYP P450 isozymes have not yet been fully characterized, assessing in advance the possible effect of genetic polymorphism in metabolizing enzymes on drug concentrations is necessary based on the metabolic pathway of the drug.</p>

               <p>When a drug is excreted into urine, blood drug concentration depends on renal clearance. Renal function generally declines with age, and it is possible that drug concentrations may be elevated in elderly patients with decreased renal clearance.

The mean age was higher in the Japanese at 64.0 years compared with 58.6 years for Koreans. The review report indicates that more Korean patients than Japanese patients were enrolled with intractable overactive bladder, which is more often observed in younger patients, and that this may have accounted for the lower treatment effect in Korean patients than in Japanese patients.</p>
               <p>Age is recognized as an important factor influencing study results generally and not specifically for MRCT. A higher proportion of elderly patients in one region relative to other regions can affect study results due to increased drug concentration with decreased metabolic function. Similarly, confounding factors with age influence study results, such as reduced hepatic or renal function, increased use of concomitant drugs, and age-associated lifestyle change. Namely, imbalance in confounding factors with age could influence results in an MRCT. The reduced renal function introduced in the discussion of renal clearance is a typical example of a confounding factor with age.</p>

               <p>Disease severity is a major factor influencing treatment effect in clinical trials in general. In an MRCT comparing a new drug with placebo, if the drug is not as effective in severe disease as in mild disease, efficacy results in a region with a higher percentage of severe patients may be reduced. Since disease severity directly influences treatment effect in clinical studies, the distribution of disease severity by region and the ways in which it will affect study results need to be examined in planning an MRCT. Attention is likewise required in a case such as schizophrenia, where patient response can differ depending on the disease phase, and thus the regional distribution of patients in specific phases must be considered.</p>

The percentage of patients with treatment history depends on the medical environment in the region.

No clear difference was observed in the incidence of adverse events related to the pharmacological properties of the drugs, but more adverse events that were mild or not related to the test drugs were reported in Japanese patients than in Korean patients.

The dropout rate tends to be lower at a site with good patient–investigator relationships or with procedures in place to prevent patient discontinuation. In a region in an MRCT having a relatively high dropout rate, it is possible that treatment effect is low because patients discontinue treatment before sufficient drug effect is observed.

         <p>Chance variability cannot be ignored in any discussion of regional differences in an MRCT. In the case of comparative study aiming to show significant difference between treatment groups, the treatment effect in a region can be partially ensured by demonstrating positive results in that region. This can be achieved by having a sufficient number of patients as calculated using method 1 or 2 proposed by the PMDA. Assuming a typical 2-arm comparative study, about 20% of total patients are needed for a region with method 1. This is not workable if many regions have this requirement, and method 2 also has this issue.<sup>

            </sup> Further discussion is therefore necessary regarding the definition of <italic>region</italic>.</p>
         <p>To control the effect of differences in pharmacokinetics, clinical pharmacology studies need to be conducted in advance of planning an MRCT to investigate the effect of factors such as food, body size, and age on pharmacokinetics. In cases where drug concentration is markedly higher for a region, dose adjustment for the region may be one option in MRCT. This is an approach for dose adjustment based on pharmacokinetics data. Since a study with dose adjustment includes more than 2 doses in 1 arm, some statistical approach may be required for data analysis.</p>
         <p>To avoid differences in study results due to imbalances in patient characteristics among regions, patients can be enrolled with identical proportions of characteristics across regions. For example, the same proportion of patients having severe, moderate, and mild disease at 20%, 30%, and 40% of the total, respectively, can be enrolled. However, if this artificial proportion is different from the actual proportion observed in a region, the results from the artificial proportion may not represent true results in the region. It is also possible in the statistical analysis of the data from an MRCT to estimate regional treatment effect by adjusting according to patient characteristics and using statistical models. With this adjustment, treatment effects without bias can be estimated and compared with those from other regions.</p>
         <p>To deal with the differences in relevant guidelines and commonly used drugs, detailed criteria on basic therapies and concomitant medications in the protocol based on preliminary research can be used to standardize conditions across regions. Assessing candidate sites and investigators in advance and balancing selection based on the characteristics and specialty of sites and investigators can also reduce bias in results.</p>
         <p>It is effective for the sponsor of the study to organize meetings of investigators and clinical research coordinators, using the same instructors and materials, before the start of the study to achieve standardization of information, study procedures, efficacy assessment, and adverse event reporting across regions.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>With expansions in scale and geography, the MRCT has become essential in new drug development. It now encompasses more races, ethnicities, and cultures than ever before. It is necessary to identify and address factors influencing study results in advance to allow for the accurate estimation of true drug efficacy and safety in each region in an MRCT without needless bias, especially for drugs without any true difference in effect and safety between patients in different regions.</p>
