<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of the study was to examine the association of time (high school to post-high school), living situation (independent of parents or not), diabetes-specific self-efficacy, and worry about hypoglycemia and how diabetes-specific self-efficacy and worry about hypoglycemia are associated with diabetes management among emerging adults with type 1 diabetes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721712465341">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Participants (N = 114) completed measures on diabetes management, diabetes-specific self-efficacy, and worry about hypoglycemia during the last 6 months in high school (T1) and diabetes management, diabetes-specific self-efficacy, and living situation post-high school (T2). General linear mixed model for the diabetes management outcome was used to test associations with diabetes-specific self-efficacy, worry about hypoglycemia, time, and living situation independent variables. Moderation by diabetes-specific self-efficacy and worry about hypoglycemia was also tested.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721712465341">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Diabetes management increased from high school to post-high school but was not significantly associated with living situation (independent of parents or not). Diabetes management was better for youth with greater diabetes-specific self-efficacy. However, neither diabetes-specific self-efficacy nor worry about hypoglycemia moderated the relationship between diabetes management and time or between diabetes management and living situation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Diabetes management improved over time for these emerging adults with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes-specific self-efficacy is important for diabetes management regardless of whether youth are in high school or post-high school and whether living with parents or not.</p>

<p>A critical developmental time for youth with type 1 diabetes is emerging adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712465341">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712465341">2</xref></sup> This newly recognized developmental period, from about 18-25+ years of age, is known as a time during which youth experience increasing freedoms and many changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712465341">3</xref></sup> The early years may be especially challenging; these youth are graduating from high school, a major rite of passage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712465341">4</xref></sup> and undergoing a major move, leaving the parental home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712465341">5</xref></sup> Up to 56% of emerging adults in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712465341">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712465341">7</xref></sup> and 52% of those with type 1 diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712465341">8</xref></sup> live independently of parents. The worsening of glycemic control during the early years of emerging adulthood around 17-19 years of age may be an indication of the challenges these youth may be experiencing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712465341">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712465341">10</xref></sup> Glycemic control is influenced by diabetes management,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712465341">11</xref></sup> which may be particularly challenging as these youth adjust their routines for checking glucose levels, administering insulin, managing hypoglycemia, having regular meals, and exercising. It is likely that diabetes management worsens during this developmental transition and for those who transition to independent living; however, no known published study has examined the changes in diabetes management in relation to these transitions.</p>
<p>Emerging adults’ readiness for these transitions could be associated with individual characteristics such as diabetes-specific self-efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712465341">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712465341"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712465341"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712465341"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712465341">16</xref></sup> and worry about hypoglycemia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712465341">17</xref></sup> which are known to be associated with diabetes management for younger age groups. These youth need to rely more on themselves because of the great freedoms experienced during this developmental period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712465341">3</xref></sup> and less proximity to parental support for their diabetes tasks, especially if they have moved out of parental homes. Youth with greater diabetes-specific self-efficacy may be more likely to move to independent living and maintain good diabetes management. In contrast, those with low diabetes-specific self-efficacy and poor diabetes management may be more likely to remain at home. Emerging adults with high levels of worry about hypoglycemia would be concerned that parents would no longer be immediately available for assistance with hypoglycemic events if they moved out of parental homes. However, that lack of assistance may not be a concern for those with low levels of worry about hypoglycemia. No known published study has examined the influence of diabetes-specific self-efficacy and worry about hypoglycemia on diabetes management during these transitions.</p>
<p>This study addresses the little-researched population of emerging adults with type 1 diabetes, and it could expand the understanding of these youths’ readiness for major transitions. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the association of time (high school to post-high school) and living situation (independently of parents or not) with diabetes-specific self-efficacy, worry about hypoglycemia, and diabetes management, and how diabetes-specific self-efficacy and worry about hypoglycemia are associated with diabetes management among emerging adults with type 1 diabetes. For emerging adults with type 1 diabetes, it was hypothesized that:</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>This report uses data collected from an ongoing longitudinal study of the transition to young adulthood among youth with type 1 diabetes. Such a design had advantages over cross-sectional designs and provides a description of change of salient constructs and behaviors during developmental periods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712465341">18</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-0145721712465341">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The targeted sample was high school seniors with type 1 diabetes who were recruited from outpatient diabetes care clinics of a regional university medical center, a private hospital, and a regional diabetes care center. Participants were enrolled either face-to-face at a clinic appointment or via the telephone after patients and their parents received a brief study summary from their health care provider. Inclusion criteria were: being 17-19 years of age and in the last 6 months of high school; diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at least 1 year ago; able to speak and read English; and living with their parent or guardian. Potential participants were excluded if they had a serious psychiatric disorder or a second chronic illness that would interfere with becoming independent. The study received approval from the appropriate Institutional Review Boards. Consent was obtained from participants 18 years of age and older, whereas for those who were under 18 years of age, assent was obtained from participants and consent from parents.</p>
<p>Participants completed questionnaires using Web-based entry, and some chose a paper option. Time 1 (T1) data were collected at baseline during the last 6 months of high school, and time 2 (T2) data were collected in the fall of the year post-high school graduation (September through mid-December). The time interval between T1 and T2 ranged from 91 to 311 days, with a mean of 192.39 days (SD = 48.90). Data were collected on diabetes management and diabetes-specific self-efficacy at both T1 and T2, on worry about hypoglycemia at T1 only, and on living situation at T2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145721712465341">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Sociodemographic and diabetes-related data were assessed at T1 and T2. At T1, participants were asked questions regarding their age, parental education, and marital status. Participants’ responses to T2 questions about their living situation (parents, roommates, etc) were categorized as either living independently of parents or not. A1C (done using a standardized assay, either on the DCA2000 [Siemens Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY], A1C Now kit [Bayer Healthcare Metrika, Sunnyvale, CA], or BioRad D10 [Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA]) was obtained from medical records as a measure of glycemic control at T1.</p>
<p>Diabetes management was measured by the 24-item Emerging Adult Diabetes Management Self-Report that measures management of diabetes related to diet, exercise, blood glucose testing, insulin administration, and hypoglycemia for either conventional or flexible regimens. This measure is an adaptation of the reliable and valid Diabetes Self-Management Profile (DSMP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712465341">19</xref></sup> from an interview format for use with adolescents to a self-report for cognitively mature emerging adults. Although adaptations of the DSMP to self-report have recently been published,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712465341">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712465341">21</xref></sup> this study used its own adaptation since the study was initiated prior to those publications. In contrast to Wysocki’s recently published self-report in which participants were asked questions in relation to the past month,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712465341">20</xref></sup> participants in this study were asked to respond in relation to the past 3 months to be consistent with other measures collected every 3 months in the larger study. In a forced-choice format, participants were asked to respond to how often they performed diabetes tasks as well as what changes they made to their regimen given specific situations. Summed score for total management provided potential ranges of 0-84 and had a Cronbach α value of .77. According to the recommendation of the DSMP developers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712465341">19</xref></sup> only the total management scale was used, since the subscales for diet, exercise, blood glucose testing, insulin administration, and hypoglycemia management did not have adequate reliability in that study (α &lt; .50) nor in the present study of older youth (α &lt; 0.65).</p>
<p>Diabetes-specific Self-Efficacy was measured by a revised 8-item Diabetes Self-efficacy Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712465341">22</xref></sup> that measured youth’s beliefs regarding their confidence in their diabetes care abilities. The original 7-item scale was revised to 8 items, differentiating treatment of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia as well as reflecting contemporary diabetes treatment. The 8 questions were related to taking insulin correctly, eating right for your diabetes, testing blood glucose at least 3 times a day, fitting exercise into your treatment plan, treating low blood glucose, taking steps to prevent low blood glucose, remembering to do everything, and making adjustments for high blood glucose. Using a rating format, participants graded themselves on how well they could do tasks, ranging from an “A+” designating “<italic>could not do better</italic>,” with a score of 9, to an “F” designating “<italic>you are a disaster</italic>,” with a score of 1. Summed scores could range from 8-72. Cronbach α were .78 for the 7-item scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712465341">22</xref></sup> and .85 for the adapted 8-item scale in this sample.</p>
<p>Worry about hypoglycemia was measured by the Worry Subscale of the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712465341">23</xref></sup> The original subscale had 17 items and was revised to 18 items for this study. The item “appearing drunk or stupid” was separated into 2 items because this age group would conceive of being drunk and being stupid differently. Participants were asked to rate how often they had worried with potential responses from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). Responses were summed for an overall score, with a potential range of 18-90. Cronbach α for the worry subscale were .88 with a sample of adolescents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712465341">24</xref></sup> .89 with a sample of adolescents and adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712465341">23</xref></sup> and .93 in this sample.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>First, descriptive statistics were computed to describe the sample in terms of diabetes-related (such as A1C and time since diabetes diagnosis) and sociodemographic (such as age, race, and sex), variables as well as the variables of interest (self-efficacy, worry about hypoglycemia, and diabetes management). Next, diabetes management outcome was modeled over time using a general linear mixed effects model (GLMM). This modeling strategy is also known by various other names, such as hierarchical linear modeling or random effects modeling. Although similar in purpose to traditional repeated-measures analysis of covariance, a GLMM approach has several advantages. In GLMM, missing data at 1 or more time points does not result in loss of the subject or available data. In addition, the GLMM strategy allows for time-varying covariates, flexible covariance structures, and subject-specific effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712465341">25</xref></sup> An unstructured covariance structure was used to model the variance and covariance among the 2 repeated measures within each subject. Time was treated as a fixed effect. Covariates included living independently at T2, diabetes-specific self-efficacy (time-varying, since measured at both T1 and T2), and worry about hypoglycemia (measured at T1 only). Moderation effects were tested by including interaction terms between time, living independently, and the other covariates. For the diabetes management outcome, a full model with main and interaction effects was specified first (intercept; time; living independently; diabetes- specific self-efficacy; worry about hypoglycemia; time with living independently, diabetes-specific self-efficacy and worry about hypoglycemia; and living independently with diabetes-specific self-efficacy and worry about hypoglycemia). Nonsignificant interaction effects were subsequently eliminated from the model. All models were estimated using the PROC MIXED procedure available in SAS/STAT software (SAS, Inc, Cary, NC) using a .05 level of significance.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>For this report, the sample consisted of high school students recruited in the first 3 years of the study. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712465341">Table 1</xref> provides a description of the sample. The sample was composed of 114 youth (mean age = 18.3 y, SD = 0.4; range = 17.3-19.6 y) with type 1 diabetes who graduated from high school in May/June of the year and who had complete data for the selected variables at T1 and T2. Most participants were white (94.7%) and female (58.8%). At T1, 49.1% of participants were on insulin pumps; they had had diabetes for an average of 8.6 years (SD = 3.9; range = 1.1-17.2 y), and the 110 with A1C data had an average value of 8.5% (SD = 1.4; range = 6.2%-14.0%). At T1, a considerable portion lived with both of their parents (60.5%), and high school was the highest level of education for most of the parents (47.7% for mothers and 43.4% for fathers). Although all participants lived with at least 1 parent at T1, most lived independently of their parents (56.1%) and were enrolled in college (80.7%) at T2. If they were living independently of parents at T2, they lived an average of 125.70 (SD = 158.25; range = 0-1000) miles from them. At T2, 24 (21.1%) reported hypoglycemic events requiring help and only 1 reported a hypoglycemic event with a seizure. For these first 3 years of recruitment, the participation rate was 85% and the attrition rate was 19% for this follow-up period.</p>

<title>Testing of Hypotheses</title>
<p>The first hypothesis was that diabetes management will worsen over time (high school to post-high school). In the model containing all variables of interest (time, living independently, diabetes-specific self-efficacy, and worry about hypoglycemia), participants demonstrated an increase in diabetes management (β = 1.76, <italic>P</italic> = .006) from T1 to T2 over and above other variables in the model. However, this finding was in the opposite direction of the hypothesis that diabetes management would worsen.</p>
<p>The second hypothesis was that diabetes management will be worse for those living independently of parents than for those who do not. In the model containing all variables of interest (time, living independently, diabetes-specific self-efficacy, and worry about hypoglycemia), participants did not demonstrate a significant increase in diabetes management based on whether they lived independently or not from parents post-high school (β = -2.59, p = .07). This hypothesis was not supported.</p>
<p>Although not a separate hypothesis, there was a significant finding for diabetes-specific self-efficacy, but not for worry about hypoglycemia. In the model containing all variables of interest (time, living independently, diabetes-specific self-efficacy, and worry about hypoglycemia), participants with greater levels of diabetes self-efficacy demonstrated a significantly higher level of diabetes management (β = .68, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). However, worry about hypoglycemia was not a statistically significant independent predictor of diabetes management.</p>
<p>The final hypothesis was that diabetes-specific self-efficacy and worry about hypoglycemia will moderate the relationships between time (high school to post-high school) and living situation (independently of parents or not) with diabetes management. Interactions between time and diabetes-specific self-efficacy and worry about hypoglycemia, as well as interactions between living situation and diabetes-specific self-efficacy and worry about hypoglycemia, were examined; however, no interactions were statistically significant. This hypothesis was not supported.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This sample of emerging adults with type 1 diabetes did experience some changes in their diabetes management during this transitional period. Diabetes management increased from high school to the post-high school time period. These findings are contrary to the hypothesis that diabetes management would worsen from high school to post-high school. In addition, the hypothesis that diabetes management would be worse for those who lived independently of parents was not supported. It appears that the many freedoms and changes experienced by emerging adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712465341">3</xref></sup> did not disrupt diabetes management in this sample of youth.</p>
<p>Diabetes management is associated with diabetes-specific self-efficacy, but not with worry about hypoglycemia for these emerging adults with diabetes. Better management is associated with better self-efficacy and is consistent with existing evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712465341">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712465341">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712465341">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712465341">16</xref></sup> Although diabetes-specific self-efficacy is important for diabetes management, self-efficacy did not moderate the relationship of management with living situation nor time from high school to post-high school for these youth. This finding suggests that the association of diabetes-specific self-efficacy with diabetes management did not vary over time (high school to post-high school) or with living situation (living independently of parental homes or not) for youth in this study. In addition, worry about hypoglycemia did not interact differently with diabetes management over time (high school to post-high school) or with living situation (living independently of parental homes or not) for youth in this study.</p>
<p>Limitations of the study need to be considered. Generalizability of findings from this study is limited to similar samples of youth with type 1 diabetes. These youths’ average glycemic control of 8.5% indicates poorer control than the American Diabetes Association’s and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes’s goal of A1C &lt; 7.5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712465341">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721712465341">27</xref></sup> However, this sample had glycemic control levels similar those of a sample of late adolescents who were intensively managed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712465341">10</xref></sup> but better glycemic control than a more representative sample of late adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712465341">9</xref></sup> Youth in this sample also did not have high levels of diabetes management, which is consistent with poor diabetes management known to occur during adolescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721712465341">27</xref></sup> The proportion of youth with diabetes living independently of parents in this study was similar to the proportion with type 1 diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712465341">8</xref></sup> and the general population who lived independently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712465341">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712465341">7</xref></sup> However, this sample may be unique because those with comorbid conditions that had an impact on independence and management were excluded and a considerable portion of parents were married and had a relatively high level of parental education. Other important transitional events such as transfer from pediatric to adult care providers were not examined in this study with a limited sample size. Finally, this sample was recruited from 3 different sites, and the possibility of differences among the settings exists; however, that diversity adds to the generalizability of the findings.</p>
<p>High school students who are about to graduate from high school and/or move out of parental homes need to be assessed for their readiness for these transitions. The findings from this study provide some evidence to guide transition planning for health care providers working with emerging adults. Diabetes management did not decrease over time; however, there is room for improvement in management. The average high school and post-high school scores (50.5 and 52.8) on diabetes management, although greater than the scale’s midpoint of 42, is not close to the highest potential score of 84. In addition, diabetes-specific self-efficacy needs to be assessed and considered in developing transition plans for these emerging adults. Although diabetes-specific self-efficacy did not moderate the relationship between diabetes management and time and between diabetes management and living situation, youth with better self-efficacy had better management. Youth with low diabetes-specific self-efficacy may need extra time during which parents and youth share diabetes care; existing evidence indicates that parents and younger adolescents who share diabetes care have greater diabetes-specific self- efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712465341">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Further research examining the effect of transitional events on specific aspects of diabetes management with a larger sample is needed, along with exploration of other influential factors and over a greater period of time. For example, quality and amount of parental support could provide more information than living independently of parents, a proxy for immediate availability of parental support. Further, the exploration of other transitional events such as moving from pediatric to adult care providers is advocated in this age group. Examination of specific aspects of diabetes management and how youth provide structure or adapt routines around them may also be especially important to study. Development and testing of interventions targeted at enhancing diabetes-specific self-efficacy are also suggested by this study’s findings. Interventions demonstrated to be effective could then be incorporated into transition programs for these youth.</p>
