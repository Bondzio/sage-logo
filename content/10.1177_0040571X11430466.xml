<p>From 1999 to 2002 John McNeill was a children’s worker in Shetland. In that context he sensed that Calvinist attitudes to children continued to have a living influence on the way that Christians regarded the children in their midst. It was on the basis of this experience that McNeill decided to work as a graduate student on a theology of the child, latterly under my supervision. Summing up what a Calvinist attitude to children entails McNeill cites Sam Doherty, a former Irish President of the Child Evangelism Fellowship, who spells out the consequences of the doctrine of total depravity as it relates to children. Doherty writes: ‘All children are therefore spiritually dead, and they will all die physically – as a result of sin. Because all children are spiritually dead, they are outside God’s kingdom, and they are all LOST as far as their position is concerned.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040571X11430466">1</xref></sup> Beginning with key biblical stories about children, McNeill offers a reading of Calvin, and of several subsequent theologians in the Calvinist tradition, that results in a biblically underpinned, theologically affirmative language of children that is more conducive to their salvation. In short, he finds that in the Bible children are beautiful to God.</p>
<p>In my own Christian family, and in my local church, children were more typically loved and nurtured. In the Methodist chapel in Manchester where I was a Sunday school scholar, a well-known aquatint picture hung picturing Jesus with six children – a blonde European, an African, a child in a hula skirt from the Pacific, another in firs from the frozen North, and two others representing South East Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It was peeling dryly at the edges even then, and could have been there anything between ten and fifty years. It was sentimental, of course, but its message was nonetheless memorably plain: Jesus loved children, and not just children from a Manchester suburb, but children everywhere.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, in the UK at least, the statistics of church attendance suggest that in a number of churches children are largely absent. In Britain Sunday School enrolment of children between the ages of 5 and 14 fell from 75 per cent in 1900 to 45 per cent in 1960. In the Church of Scotland, for which statistical data continues beyond the 1960s, Sunday School enrolments fell from 46 per cent in 1900 to 10 per cent in 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040571X11430466">2</xref></sup> On another measure of the participation of children in church life, the number of infant baptisms in the Church of England fell from just over 60 per cent of all live births in 1900 to just over 20 per cent in 1996. And if the statistics in the United States and elsewhere reflect a different local context, nonetheless the issue of how children figure in the life of churches is universally important.</p>
<p>There are certainly signs that recognition of the need for a theology of the child is growing. In the Church of England, dissatisfaction with the liturgy for the baptism of infants is mounting; more widely, the potential of ‘godly play’, either during Sunday services or supplemental to them, is beginning to be realized; greater recognition of the devastation that results from the loss of an infant or a child is suggsted by distinct liturgies in several traditions and by impressively sensitive work by hospital chaplains with the parents of children who have died.</p>
<p>But there is more to a theology of the child than thinking theologically about how to work with and around children in the life of the church and the local community. Or, to put it another way, a theology of the child is not simply about a theology for childhood: children teach the rest of us how <italic>we</italic> should be in relation to God. Jesus seems to suggest this when he set a child before his disciples and said, ‘Truly I tell you: unless you turn round and become like children you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven. Whoever humbles himself and becomes like this child will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven’ (Matt. 18.3–4 <sc>REB</sc>). With these verses in mind, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, at the end of the dissertation written to qualify him as a university lecturer, wrote of the child as in this sense a model for the Christian life: ‘To-let-oneself-be-defined by means of the future is the eschatalogical possibility of the child … It is the new creation of those born out of the world’s confines into the wideness of heaven, becoming what they were or never were, a creature of God, a child.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040571X11430466">3</xref></sup></p>
