<title>The Problem</title>
<p>In this case study we see a move away from orthodox views of school leadership as “headship” to a more contemporary model of educational leadership wherein we note a departure from functional, curricula-based school leadership toward more human resource development (HRD) approaches. The aim of this study was to consider the effectiveness of an educational development program for middle leaders within an educational establishment.</p>

<title>The Stakeholders</title>
<p>The leadership development intervention was designed through a tripartite collaboration including a university, senior school leaders, and staff. The intervention was designed to shift leadership from individual leader agency to interdependent human leadership agency. Through tripartite evaluation we uncover leadership development praxis that transcends the boundaries of conventional educational leadership and reemphasizes the benefits of bridging the academic/practitioner divide and the application of theory to praxis.</p>

<p>In the 1980s a “leadership craze” emerged as an international phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1523422312466982">Terry, 1995</xref>). The education sector was not immune to this craze. Several scholars took up the challenge to investigate educational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1523422312466982">Harris, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1523422312466982">2008</xref>). However, most interpreted school leadership to be concerned with managing the delivery of nationally imposed curricula. Although references are made to wider leadership issues, these have been left underdeveloped by scholars. More recently, there have been calls for more appropriate methods to address leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1523422312466982">Hay &amp; Hodgkinson, 2008</xref>) and new forms of leadership development in the educational sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312466982">Ayas &amp; Zenuick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422312466982">Cunliffe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312466982">Cunliffe &amp; Shotter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466982">Day, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1523422312466982">Hemetsberger &amp; Reinhardt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1523422312466982">Kempster &amp; Stewart, 2010</xref>). There have been growing concerns with the dearth of qualitative research in the field of educational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422312466982">Alvesson &amp; Deetz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422312466982">Chauvel &amp; Despres, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312466982">Czarniawska, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1523422312466982">Kern, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This study addresses scholarly and policy makers’ concerns for change within education leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422312466982">Department of Education, 2010</xref>). Our study moves away from orthodox views of school leadership as “headship” to a more contemporary model of educational leadership. We depart from functional, curricula-based school leadership toward more human resource development (HRD) approaches. Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312466982">Hannum’s (2004)</xref> research and drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1523422312466982">Weick’s (1995)</xref> notions of sense-making, we evaluated the formation and cohesiveness of a newly formed innovative leadership structure in a school formed from the merger of three existing schools. In particular, we evaluated a bespoke higher education intervention in Leadership and Change designed to shift individual leader agency to interdependent human leadership agency. We argue that this shift is critical to improvements in leadership performance. Our evaluation considered benefits for the provider: a university and the user(s): the organization (a school) and its staff (the students), thus forming a tripartite evaluative perspective.</p>
<p>There is broad consensus in the literature that leadership is essential to better organizational performance. There are a raft of books, articles in academic and practitioner journals, and a few TV celebrities that have emphasized the role of leaders as paramount to organizational success, for example, Peters and Waterman, Kanter and Harvey-Jones, to name but a few. The leadership construct has well-grounded recipes for successful management and leadership has been accepted as a “real” phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312466982">Alvesson &amp; Sveningsson, 2003</xref>). An explosion of the leadership field from 1999 to 2006 is summarized by the then editor of <italic>The Leadership Quarterly</italic> with Transformational/Charismatic Leadership accounting for 33% of the studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1523422312466982">Hunt, 2005</xref>). Leadership involves at a minimum a leader, a collection of followers, and a context; yet most studies focus on the leaders themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1523422312466982">Tosi, 1991</xref>). Increasingly, the notion that leadership stems only from an individual is becoming less acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1523422312466982">Ensley, Hmeileski, &amp; Pearce, 2006</xref>). Some research has contradicted the view of leadership being important to performance improvement. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312466982">Avolio, Wlaumbwa, and Weber (2009)</xref> found the style and characteristics of the CEO as being unrelated toward organizational success and performance. More recently, there has been a gradual shift away from the individual toward organizational structures as influences on leadership. Hand in hand with new organizational forms is the need to displace the dualistic and dyadic nature of the relationship between leaders and followers. New organizational forms, in particular, those of a collaborative nature, imply a sharing of leadership and an espoused sharing of power enabled and facilitated through empowerment and disbursing of prior centrally controlled leadership behaviors.</p>
<p>There have been repeated calls for consideration in the leadership field to address the issue of contextualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422312466982">Currie, Boyett, &amp; Suhomlinova, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1523422312466982">Osborn, Hunt, &amp; Jauch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1523422312466982">Porter &amp; McLaughlin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1523422312466982">Zaccaro &amp; Horn, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1523422312466982">Osborn et al. (2002)</xref> argue that leadership is dependent on context particularly when linked with change—change in context results in changes in leadership. Key aspects of their context spectrum range from organizations having a strategic fit with leadership mechanically adjusted to fit collective dynamic aspects of leadership combined with new forms of leadership to ensure sustainability of a system.</p>
<p>The major contributions of this empirical study are how to move from individual to integrated leadership, what enabled this to happen, benefits to the organization, and a greater understanding and knowledge about developing leadership in schools in terms of enabling an integrated structure. This article has three sections. The first section outlines the theoretical context and methodological approach. In the second section we review the leadership literature highlighting a lack of empirical studies about public sector organizations and a lack of understanding about leadership in schools. The third and final section provides findings about moving from individual leadership to a more integrated leadership model, how such a move is enabled, and the benefits of doing so.</p>

<title>Public Sector and Educational Leadership</title>
<p>Public sector reform is being acted on by governments and public service organizations endeavoring to bring about significant changes in governance, design, and delivery of public services. In the United Kingdom there has been continual restructuring of the education sector over the last three decades with a priori focus on productivity and value for money. However, what is striking about the United Kingdom’s drive for fundamental change is “a new emphasis on partnerships and networks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1523422312466982">Ferlie, Hartley, &amp; Martin, 2003</xref>, p. S1). Traditional organizational forms characterized by rigid hierarchies, divisions of labor, and strong managerial control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1523422312466982">Weber, 1978</xref>) are loosening and emerging as new organizational forms in response to the changing nature of today’s environment. Public leadership is a theme of widespread interest currently within U.K. policy and academic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422312466982">Currie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1523422312466982">Ferlie et al., 2003</xref>) and U.K. public services have attracted key academics including the aforementioned along with others such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1523422312466982">Pettigrew, Woodman, and Cameron (2001)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422312466982">Balogun (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312466982">2006</xref>). Yet the range of public sector literature has been confined mainly to political science, psychology, and the NHS. In their reviews, published in 1999 and 2000, Kellerman and Webster describe the literature on public leadership as “meager” and argued that “social scientists have failed to create a critical mass of scholarly work on public sector leadership” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1523422312466982">2001</xref>, p 487).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1523422312466982">Ferlie et al. (2003)</xref> reviewed papers on public service organizations in the <italic>British Journal of Management</italic> (<italic>BJOM</italic>) between the years 1992 and 2002. They determined that articles had a strong health care focus with few articles conducting analysis across different U.K. public services. They concluded that “published work has so far been highly concentrated within certain sectors, disciplines and methods” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1523422312466982">Ferlie et al., 2003</xref>, p. S5). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1523422312466982">Silvia and McGuire (2010)</xref> highlight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1523422312466982">Van Wart’s (2003)</xref> study not only laments a meager public leadership range of articles but also notes that those that do exist are not empirical in nature and focused on leaders at the pinnacle of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>There are an even smaller number of studies in the context of school leadership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422312466982">Currie et al. (2005)</xref> note that government policy assumes an unproblematic link between effective leadership and school improvement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422312466982">Connolly, Connolly, and James’s (2000)</xref> study on leadership in educational change highlights that the role of leadership in change is new for head teachers. Their study deals with performance associated with the functional side of management and only touches on the role of leading change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1523422312466982">Webb (2005)</xref> notes that educational management and leadership is unexplored territory and that there are few studies that have increased understanding about leadership in schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312466982">Bolden (2011</xref>, p. 256) goes on to notify us that distributed leadership “appears to have been picked up and promoted within UK education policy” and has significantly shaped educational leadership (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1523422312466982">Edwards, 2011</xref>). However, although distributed leadership is associated with school leadership, it is concerned largely with distributing teachers to lead curricula and not leadership per se with ambiguities and uncertainties about how leaders relate to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1523422312466982">Turnbull James, Mann, &amp; Creasy, 2007</xref>). In spite of educational research on distributed leadership in schools emerging in the early 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1523422312466982">Thorpe, Gold, &amp; Lawler, 2011</xref>), it has been omitted from management and organization studies (MOS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422312466982">Fitzsimons, Turnbull James, &amp; Denyer, 2011</xref>). Studies within the educational literatures denote distributed leadership in schools as educational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1523422312466982">Webb, 2005</xref>), instructional, formal, and aligned to teacher practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422312466982">Camburn, Rowan, &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312466982">Cawelti, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1523422312466982">Hallinger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1523422312466982">Harris, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1523422312466982">Harris &amp; Spillane, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1523422312466982">Johnson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1523422312466982">MacBeath, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1523422312466982">O’Reilly, Cladwell, Chatman, Lapiz, &amp; Self, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1523422312466982">Spillane, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1523422312466982">Hallinger’s (2003)</xref> study reviewed the conceptual and empirical development of two leadership models: Instructional Leadership, defined as “leadership focused on curriculum and instruction from the principal” (p. 329; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422312466982">Earley, Evans, Collarbone, Gold, &amp; Halpin, 2002</xref>), and transformational leadership, a model adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312466982">Bass (1985)</xref> and developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1523422312466982">Leithwood and Jantz (2000)</xref>. The latter model was created to counteract a directive leadership model by engaging others in leadership and change activity concerned with learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1523422312466982">Hallinger (2003</xref>, p. 343) concludes that both instructional and transformational leadership are necessary and proposes that the two should be integrated so that transformational principals can invite teachers to share leadership functions. However, that study echoes many that precede and follow it (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1523422312466982">Gunter &amp; Rayner, 2007</xref>) by focusing on leadership and change concerned with curricula. Furthermore, historically many educational experiments fail within the first few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1523422312466982">Harris, 2005</xref>). Our study demonstrates leadership, evaluated by key stakeholders in a bespoke leadership development intervention that transcends traditional school leadership praxis.</p>

<title>Leadership Development</title>
<p>It is widely regarded that an organization’s greatest strategic differentiator comes from its talent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312466982">Boxall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1523422312466982">Grant, 1991</xref>; Porter, 1995), particularly emphasizing leadership development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466982">Day, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1523422312466982">Iles &amp; Preece, 2006</xref>), and is among the most popular areas of human resource development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312466982">Ardichvilli &amp; Manderscheid, 2008</xref>). It is therefore anticipated that when any investment is made on a specific training and development activity for its leaders, positive consequential benefits in relation to business success and improvement are achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1523422312466982">Mabey &amp; Finch-Lees, 2008</xref>). One of the key aspects of HRD has been self-development and personal development with reliance on the needs of the individual along with the implementation of development interventions to achieve success. Different forms of leadership development profess to promote organizational success. A notable trend has been the discussion and focus on the value of management education as an approach to the development of key senior managers and leaders in organizations. In particular, and almost exclusively, this has been in terms of MBA programs offered by business schools across the globe. A number of criticisms have been leveled toward such programs with some questioning the whole knowledge transfer process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1523422312466982">Pfeffer &amp; Fong, 2002</xref>). According to others, the majority of leadership development models, approaches, and programs have been influenced by the leader-centric viewpoint of leadership and dominate the HRD literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1523422312466982">Orvis &amp; Ratwani 2010</xref>). Recognition of these criticisms needs to be balanced against benefits derived from such programs and some academics have made counterclaims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422312466982">Dexter &amp; Prince, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1523422312466982">Starkey, Hutchuel, &amp; Tempest, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1523422312466982">Weindling, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, management education continues to be utilized encouraging and supporting leadership development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1523422312466982">Greengard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1523422312466982">Ibarra, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1523422312466982">Risher &amp; Stopper, 2001</xref>). We have witnessed an increasing surge in popularity, interestingly enough away from management development toward leadership development as part of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1523422312466982">Lambert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1523422312466982">Leskiw &amp; Singh, 2007</xref>). This no doubt coincides with the hot topic of leadership and that management is no longer <italic>in vogue</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422312466982">Brocklehurst, Grey, &amp; Sturdy, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, leadership development has received attention on the variances between <italic>leader</italic> development as opposed to <italic>leadership</italic> development, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422312466982">Dalakoura, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466982">Day, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1523422312466982">Illes &amp; Preece, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466982">Day (2000)</xref> relates <italic>leader development</italic> to enhancing the individual as distinct from <italic>leadership development</italic>, which looks to create collective capacity. These are not to be classed in isolation. Day recognized that both are necessary to create and sustain leadership for successful organizations. The whole approach of leadership development is seeing a renaissance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422312466982">Conger &amp; Fulmer, 2003</xref>). This article is not about school leadership per se as that leadership construct stems from functional aspects more concerned with managing delivery of politically imposed curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1523422312466982">Harris, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1523422312466982">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1523422312466982">Lambert, 2006</xref>).

Our aim was to discover how to move from one to the other and, in particular, from individual leader to interdependent leadership, what enables this to happen, and the benefits.</p>

<title>Case Study Method</title>
<p>We wanted to seek views from those being intervened upon, that is, school staff, to glean insights into leadership praxis that moves on from traditional school leadership. We acknowledge that case study research is problematic and not without challenges, nevertheless, it is growing in usage and acceptance. Case study methods have a long distinguished history and are acknowledged as a valid method of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312466982">Creswell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312466982">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1523422312466982">Lips-Wiersma &amp; Hall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1523422312466982">Merriem, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1523422312466982">Pettigrew et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1523422312466982">Stake, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1523422312466982">Yin, 2003</xref>).

<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Our qualitative study includes data gathered from semistructured interviews with multiple individuals from the case study setting. These interviews began with the strategic business director prior to the leadership development intervention commencing. We conducted reflexive semistructured interviews with two cohorts of student leaders after they completed a leadership development intervention. We also carried out a semistructured interview with the executive director postcompletion by both student leader cohorts. Twenty reflexive interviews were conducted: 9 from the first cohort comprising 8 nationally qualified teachers from across the three schools (which form the merged institution) and head of IT across the institution and 11 from the second cohort comprising 7 nationally qualified teachers and 4 admin staff. The method used to analyze the data was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312466982">Hannum’s (2004)</xref> when/what/who framework.

<title>The Case Study Setting</title>
<p>The organization under study is an educational institution in the northeast of England. Initial discussions with the institution’s senior team revealed several ways in which it made an excellent case study site. First, it involves three different types of school (primary, secondary, and special needs) formerly on three separate sites and the process of moving meant the schools experienced radical change by being jointly decanted into a single purpose-built site. Second, the schools are not merely together on a shared site, they have also gone through a formal merger (technically known as a “hard federation”) and are now managed as a single organization. Under the terms of the U.K. 2002 Education Act, a federation is a group of two or more maintained schools (primary, secondary, and/or special schools) with a joint governing body. They can operate with a school home base but coshare resources. “Hard” federation takes the grouping a step further and includes “close collaboration” between schools in a variety of circumstances who formally agree to work together to raise standards. Third, it is widely viewed as having been highly successful both in terms of the change process and in terms of the educational outcomes it is now delivering. Fourth, there was from the outset an explicit focus on leadership as a key factor in the change process.</p>
<p>The strategic merger of three schools into one building was a significant challenge and required systemwide change to realize the vision for the newly formed organization. The three schools are very different in nature, composition, design, and purpose: a secondary school that operates as a large community school and Specialist Arts College, a special school that caters for the full range of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) across a wide ability range and a small primary school. Nevertheless, there was a great deal of excitement about the Education Institution for several reasons. It was the first education establishment in the United Kingdom that combined the resources of three schools on one site, creating a prototype learning environment that would bring together secondary, SEN, and primary school provision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1523422312466982">
<title>The Merger</title>
<p>It was reported in the <italic>Times Educational Supplement</italic> (<italic>TES</italic>) in September 2005 that the existing governing bodies of the three schools had dissolved and a new single board of governors had convened on September 1 that year:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Education Institution aims to be much more than a federation of schools. It is rewriting the concept of a school and sets those running it some challenges . . . they are having to re-write the rule book on leadership in schools. (Whittaker, 2005, p. 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The bringing together of three well-established educational institutions under one roof was extremely challenging. Three schools brought along with them three separate leadership and management structures and “federation” required seamless transition of individual school systems into one integrated structure, without boundaries and led by one team. The then interim Federation Director (FD) said,<disp-quote>
<p>We are structuring fit for purpose teams who will be able to lead I think what will be the incredible new challenges and certainly get things better . . . there’s a great deal of expertise and support in there. (Whittaker, 2005, p. 5)</p>

<sec id="section10-1523422312466982">
<title>Distributed Leadership—The Organizational Rationale</title>
<p>The institution is a unique development and requires a different approach to leadership. At the heart of their planned changes are workforce reform and a concept of coleadership running alongside a distributed model aimed at raising pupil achievement and strengthening succession planning and management. The essential rationale behind the integrated leadership concept is that the organization did not require three head teachers and an executive director as this would perpetuate the traditional leadership model and contravene integrated leadership principles; essentially this meant a shift away from a hierarchical, traditional leadership model unchanged since the 19th century. Thus the traditional role of the head teacher was deemed redundant. This did not mean that the functions and responsibilities were redundant but that it was the functions and responsibilities of the post that needed to be allocated between the key leaders within the organization’s leadership structure. The executive director (previously interim federated director) defines the organization’s distributed leadership model as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Although many of the statutory functions are devolved to the five directors [the executive leadership team] in the [organization], distributed leadership goes deeper than this. It is concerned with the allocation of responsibilities within the organization. An increasing range of staff therefore, at all levels, have distributed responsibility for key functions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first step was to build a distributed leadership structure by putting the right people in the right place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422312466982">Connelly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1523422312466982">Mumford, Zaccaro, Connelly, &amp; Marks, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1523422312466982">Mumford, Zaccaro, Johnson, et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1523422312466982">O’Reilly et al., 2010</xref>). The second step was deploying a human resource development (HRD) strategy with a postgraduate program of study as its centerpiece. The aim of the postgraduate study is twofold: to develop individual leadership skills and to facilitate and develop collaborative leadership beyond traditional school leadership.</p>
<p>We wanted to evaluate the impact of this development intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312466982">Hannum, 2004</xref>) in terms of leadership moving to interdependent leadership, identify enablers of moving from one to the other, and the benefits to the wider organization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1523422312466982">Leskiw and Singh (2007)</xref> advocate six essential components for effective leadership development including evaluation.

Drawing from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1523422312466982">Martineau (2004)</xref>, Leskiw and Singh note that “. . . need assessments should continuously occur as part of the process in order to account for changes in the leadership capacity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1523422312466982">Leskiw &amp; Singh, 2007</xref> p. 457).

According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312466982">Hannum (2004)</xref>, there are a number of options in terms of <italic>when</italic> to evaluate (points in time: before, during, and after) along with <italic>what</italic> should be evaluated. The <italic>what</italic> can refer to a number of aspects including end of intervention evaluations, return on investment (ROI), document evaluation, analysis of organizational systems and processes, for example, education processes, and client satisfaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312466982">Hannum (2004)</xref> states that the <italic>who</italic> relates to stakeholders and not just views of participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312466982">Gold et al. (2010)</xref> form the view that evaluation of leadership development is generally and specifically geared toward the practical perspective.</p>
<sec id="section11-1523422312466982">
<title>Hannum’s “When”</title>
<p>The groundwork for evaluating a leadership development intervention was laid by identifying key stakeholders and conducting a needs assessment. The executive director and executive leadership team identified two key investments in the wider Leadership Team (a leadership level responsible to the executive leadership team): integrated leadership responsibility and leadership development. A postgraduate program was viewed by the executive leadership team as critical to the wider leadership team’s development and approached a local university to identify a suitable pathway. Consultation took place over several months during which the views of the executive leadership team suggested a clear demand for a specialist master’s degree in leadership and change designed to address the need for current and future managers to develop their job roles and responsibilities by incorporating a human resource development and organizational development focus. They did not want an education program due to the learning outcomes being more associated with a traditional school leadership structure, that is, curricula based. Subsequently, consultation took place with members of the executive leadership team and potential student leaders from the organization. A post graduate learning intervention was designed with a main aims of developing leadership and encouraging a sharing philosophy in terms of transferable praxis and to facilitate a seamless joining up of the previous three separate schools into one. The nature of the content was composed in consultation with the executive leadership team and students. The program is designed to build knowledge about the wider business environment and broaden knowledge about leadership practices that strengthen lines of communication between key organizational players and directly positively impact each other and the pupils. The core of the design was constructed through a tripartite collaboration including the executive leadership team: who requested modules about leadership and managing change, the students (teachers and nonteacher): who requested modules concerned with personal effectiveness and leadership and the business environment, and a university: which agreed that all taught elements would be delivered in the organization by university staff. Early evaluation included the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>I particularly like the core of the program, which we feel shores up and further develops the leadership and change knowledge of our staff, both in terms of our context as well as wider environments. (Strategic Business Director)</p>
<p>The program has opened up lines of professional development for staff at a high level—this would have been impossible for us to set up alone. (Director of Inclusion)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For a leadership development intervention to result in improvements it needs to include components that enable students to work together more effectively, enable each other’s points of view and creative problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312466982">Hannum, 2004</xref>). We evaluated the organizational educational systems: University as provider and the organization as client. The leadership development intervention, an MSc in leadership and change, was designed in consultation with key stakeholders and provides a bespoke opportunity for student Leaders. The mode of delivery and structure is such that it facilitates maximum learning opportunities and minimised disruption to student leaders through delivery by university staff at their place of work, that is, on the organization’s site. The student leaders studied together for a six hour period of learning at a regular time and day every week that their time table allowed per university academic year.</p>

<title>Hannum’s “Who”</title>
<p>Semistructured interviews were conducted to determine participants’ reactions, learning, and to assess perceptions of the intervention from the stakeholders’ perspectives. Interviews took place immediately prior to the intervention with senior leaders in the organization and with student leaders within 3 months post successful completion of the intervention. The offer to study for the learning intervention was made to members key leadership roles or with potential/and or aspirations of fulfilling a leadership role. The first student leader cohort comprised nine members of the wider leadership team. A second cohort, recruited after the first cohort completed their first year of study, comprised 11 members including 2 members of the wider leadership team and others destined for future leader roles. Both cohorts included student leaders from three schools that make up the organization. For the purposes of analysis the students were coded as cohort 1 leader 1—C1L1, cohort 2 leader 1—C2L1 and so on.</p>

<p>From the Documentation senior leadership evaluation describes understanding of other student leader roles in the institute (including non–Qualified Teacher Status QTS) and seeing that sometimes, the perceived unique issues are the same in each area. They also highlight sharing interventions brought into the organization from a joint perspective that can enhance organizational life, along with shared responsibility for all pupils—some staff are demonstrably picking up and addressing pupil issues from across the institute. Student leaders are seen to be actively engaging with the vision and are demonstrating commitment to joining up the institute. By having a leadership development system in place the student leaders are developing and forming as an interdependent team, other senior leadership evaluation of the leadership development intervention includes</p>

<p>Developing leadership skills was also a main aim of the leadership development intervention. The learning outcomes of the intervention were purposefully not focused around curricula leadership. Instead content included generic leadership theories to which the student leaders applied their experience. By sharing and discussing concerns and problem solving the student leaders are more aware of their own and other’s leadership style and reaction to change. Through learning together the student leaders are better able to apply theory to practice to develop the team’s interactions with each other and with the institution. These interactions are significant for a seamless joining up of the merged institution. Also evident is use of language as the student leaders are referring to the institute by its new name rather than the three separate schools.</p>

Personalised offer has been well developed across both secondary sectors (special and mainstream). Raised profile of professionalism and leadership has impacted upon Teaching and Learning and hence upon standards.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Through accessing the leadership development intervention, student leaders have been able to develop a wider perspective and understanding of a range of situations. These include discussions in leadership forums, the possible tensions, how to address and avoid these when necessary, being able to acknowledge others and their views, and ability to reflect on their own practices. It has helped the students to develop leadership skills beyond a role as a teacher or head of a specific department to leadership in a broader and more collaborative sense. As a result, they are developing as individuals both inside and outside of work as they are able to be more receptive and understanding of others’ ideas and points of view; this in turn is making for a more rounded leader in terms of cognitive awareness, strategic thinking, sharing of good practice, and empathy with those around them and for whom they work, particularly the pupils. The pupils are benefiting from the MSc as they are receiving delivery of subject content and support from staff who are more open to suggestion and change. The student leaders are able to lead and implement changes and therefore are able to engage students for longer and in a wider variety of areas. The leadership development intervention helped student leaders to become aware of the others’ leadership roles within the institution and helped the wider leadership become more coherent, approachable, and effective as a team. It has certainly strengthened the links between them and other members of staff and as a result it has brought consistency to teaching and learning approaches across the institution, especially in terms of tangible outcomes and delivery of key messages. This consistency and team work is impacting the development of a positive ethos within the institution and thus helps the pupils to focus on their learning instead of their environment. Staff said that they have become better practitioners and more effective in leadership.</p>
<p>The organization is widely known across the town as a developer of staff and the leadership development intervention contributed to achieving IIP status. This in turn raised the professional status of the staffing profile internally and raised the organizational profile externally. Staff participation has had a snowball effect with more staff wanting to undertake development opportunities, and a third cohort of student leaders was recruited as the second cohort commenced their second year of study. Staff undertaking the leadership development intervention were visibly more confident in carrying out their leader role and are seen as role models by peers and pupils.</p>

Where there have been causes for concern regarding, in the main, MBA management education, early stages of evaluation suggest that this program has on balance provided positive attributes for the individuals as well as the organization as a whole. While we acknowledge the limitations of this study as being a single case study, the research findings contribute to “what is out there” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1523422312466982">Malenfent, 2010</xref>) by increasing knowledge and understanding about school leadership and provides evidence of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1523422312466982">Harris, 2005</xref>). Through the force of this case study as an example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1523422312466982">Flyvbjerg, 2006</xref>) of how to move from individual to interdependent leadership, academics and practitioners can draw on our findings to inform HRD strategy that meets the requirements of new organizational forms.</p>
<p>We anticipate providing further insights about interdependent leadership. Our research will continue to evaluate the leadership development intervention over a longer period of time. We will conduct interviews with Cohorts 1 and 2 in terms of longer term application of theory into practice. We also plan to interview a third cohort with a view to determining a broadening out of interdependent leadership. By doing this further research, we will provide a more rounded evaluation about developing integrated leadership.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The case study focused around three schools merged into one institute on a purpose built site. Each school brought with them three separate leadership structures and a key to success was a seamless transition of individual school systems into one integrated structure. We acknowledge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1523422312466982">Ensley et al.’s (2006)</xref> notion that individual leadership is becoming less acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1523422312466982">Ensley et al., 2006</xref>); however, our research supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466982">Day’s (2000)</xref> view that both individual leader and leadership are necessary. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466982">Day’s (2000)</xref> perspective is particularly relevant as although our research acknowledges individual leaders as teachers leading curriculum, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422312466982">Camburn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312466982">Cawelti, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1523422312466982">Hallinger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1523422312466982">Harris, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1523422312466982">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1523422312466982">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1523422312466982">Harris &amp; Spillane, 2008</xref>; Johnson, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1523422312466982">MacBeath, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1523422312466982">O’Reilly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1523422312466982">Spillane, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1523422312466982">Webb, 2005</xref>), and although by default this is a natural way of doing leadership in schools, something more than leading curricula was required to join up the institute. We see a shift away from individual leadership to collaborative and interdependent leadership that transcends conventional leadership aligned to teacher practice. Enablers that facilitate this transition are twofold: First, putting the right people in the right place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422312466982">Connelly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1523422312466982">Mumford et al., 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1523422312466982">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1523422312466982">O’Reilly et al., 2010</xref>) and second, the leadership development intervention, an MSc in leadership and change, was designed in consultation with key stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312466982">Hannum, 2004</xref>) to ensure strategic fit and provides a bespoke opportunity for student leaders to learn within their organizational context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422312466982">Currie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1523422312466982">Osborn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1523422312466982">Porter &amp; McLaughlin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1523422312466982">Zaccaro &amp; Horn, 2003</xref>). Leadership development that is bespoke, contextualized, and includes components that enable students to work together more effectively, enable each other’s points of view and creative problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312466982">Hannum, 2004</xref>), This then develops individual leadership skills and facilitates collaborative and interdependent leadership beyond traditional school leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1523422312466982">Harris, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1523422312466982">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Developing leadership skills was also a main aim of the leadership development intervention. The learning outcomes of the intervention were purposefully not focused around curricula leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1523422312466982">Lambert, 2006</xref>). Instead, content included generic leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422312466982">Bennett &amp; Marr, 2003</xref>) theories to which the student leaders applied their experience. By sharing and discussing concerns and problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312466982">Hannum, 2004</xref>) the student leaders are more aware of their own and other’s leadership style and reaction to change. A key lesson is that through learning together the student leaders are better able to apply theory to practice to develop the team’s interactions with each other and with the institution. These interactions are significant for a seamless joining up of the merged institution. Also evident is use of language as the student leaders are referring to the institute by its new name rather than the three separate schools; this might be considered as the strongest evidence of integration so far.</p>
<p>The leadership development intervention, a master’s degree in leadership and change, enabled the student leaders to work together to problem-solve and think in terms of the “Big Picture” particularly when it comes to strategic planning, working across boundaries, and with each other. We acknowledge that interdependent leadership may not be considered as unusual in some sectors, we assert that it is unusual in the education sector. However, through a bespoke leadership development, collaboration has enabled sharing of good practice through an interdependent leadership structure in a newly merged school that is forging a history and learning culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1523422312466982">Lambert, 2006</xref>) for the Institution. In terms of how the tripartite collaboration benefitted from the leadership development, we conclude that the institution increased its profile and leadership capacity, the students are more self-aware with respect to their own and others leadership behavior and developed from individual leadership to a more integrated approach, and all student leaders successfully graduated and thus the university benefitted by adding to its degree program completion rates and credibility as an higher education provider to practitioners within organizational settings.</p>
