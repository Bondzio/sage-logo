<abstract>
<p>The teacher–student relationship can afford the music educator an opportunity to be the first to identify behaviors associated with epilepsy. A case of a student with epilepsy, based on the authors’ experience, is described in which the music educators were the first and only individuals to become aware of a change in the student’s behavior, after which diagnosis of his condition and direction toward resources for proper treatment could be offered. Included are a review of the current literature about epilepsy as related to music and some helpful resources for parents and teachers. Finally, specific recommendations are given for teaching strategies to optimize the educational experience of the music student with epilepsy.</p>

<p>Because music engages both the mind and the body, the music educator is at a unique vantage point to observe changes in student behavior.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A music educator’s role often extends beyond the teaching of music alone. The close interaction of teacher and student in the context of music education frequently engenders a counselor or mentor capacity for the educator.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432112451142">1</xref></sup> One article in the literature even suggests a role for the music educator as a coach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432112451142">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, as performance techniques represent a physically demanding set of tasks for the young learner, music educators are afforded a unique opportunity to witness and adapt teaching strategies to a broad spectrum of abilities in the classroom.</p>
<p>Students often participate in instrumental programs on a daily or near-daily basis, commonly ranging from three to seven years in duration. The director or private instructor may grow finely attuned to the capabilities and idiosyncrasies of each student and may be one of the first to identify a change in a student’s behavior, attitude, or daily work habits. Epilepsy is a disorder of the neuronal activity of the brain that can manifest in many different patterns of behavior and affects a number of children throughout the United States today. Prompt recognition of these changes, and engagement of support figures, including parents, counselors, and physicians in developing mechanisms to deal with them, can promote the most effective educational and indeed overall health strategies for these students, as was evidenced in the following case of a trumpet player in the seventh grade.</p>
<sec id="section1-0027432112451142">
<title>A Young Trumpeter Observed</title>
<p>A student had been diagnosed with seizure activity at the age of two years, at which time his parents and family doctor noticed frequent episodes of stopping in place while walking, with visible straining of the facial musculature. Prior to these events, he had had no family history of epilepsy or seizure activity or significant past medical history and took no medications on a regular basis. He was referred to a neurologist in a nearby hospital system and was subsequently prescribed a series of anticonvulsant medications that ameliorated the symptoms with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>By age eleven, the student began to participate in a large middle school band program that regularly enrolled one hundred new students a year. The first nine weeks of the curriculum involved an exploratory period for students in which they learned about and were tested on all instruments. This student selected the trumpet. He experienced some difficulty with tone production and was encouraged to study privately outside of band class. As difficulty in brass embouchure formation is common at this experience level, his directors were not alerted to any seizure activity in this student. Although playing was a challenge for him, the student persevered by participating in small ensembles, summer band, and private lessons.</p>
<p>The “daily contact” band director changed during the student’s second year of band, at which time the director noticed unusual behavior during weekly testing. While initially dismissing this action as a means of correction for performance errors, the director began to observe this student regularly while performing in band class. When this behavior was observed on a daily basis, the student’s private instructor, who taught at the same school, was consulted. The music educators conferred on a regular basis while experimenting with different teaching approaches in response to this behavior.</p>
<p>The episodes were observed several times during a class period and three to four times during a half-hour private lesson and followed a consistent sequence of behaviors. The initial phase of the episode appeared to be a “lack of tone response,” forcing the student to reset his embouchure. This action was immediately followed by an upward extension of the right arm, arching of the back, and a yawn. During the next phase of this ritual, the student rolled his neck to the right side of his body, then to the left. After a time, the symptoms would subside, and slowly muscle tone and control would return. It seemed at first that all these actions could be explained by what appeared to be fatigue or lack of sleep. These episodes could be predicted by listening to the tone quality and articulation as the student played, both of which prominently and steadily diminished until he produced no sound at all.</p>
<p>Many strategies were explored during the course of private lessons. First, the formation and role of the embouchure, aperture, and vibration of the lips were addressed in the context of melodic passages, test pieces, and excerpts from the band class repertoire, along with proper posture and breath support. Long tones, lip buzzing, and mouthpiece buzzing were emphasized to strengthen facial muscles, reinforce muscle memory, and focus on consistent airflow. Mental focus was emphasized for consistency of approach to the instrument.</p>
<p>As the fall semester progressed, the episodes continued on a daily basis. In mid-October, the director began to notice the student in a “zoned-out” or trancelike state. Recognizing this as a possible seizure, the director began to confer with the guidance counselor and other classroom teachers. Up to this point, the directors and private instructor had been the only educators who had noticed unusual behavior at school. Concern grew in December after the student experienced a complete loss of muscle control and consciousness, falling out of his band chair onto the floor. After he recovered, the student experienced a similar episode while walking to the nurse. Following conferences with his guidance counselor, parents, and family physician, the previously mentioned symptoms—inability to sustain an embouchure, trancelike state, and loss of consciousness—were related to his epilepsy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0027432112451142">
<title>Sleep, Stress, and Surgery</title>
<p>As time passed, the band director noticed a pattern in the set of behaviors—namely, that they occurred after a disruption of the student’s normal sleeping pattern. The first episode followed Thanksgiving break, the second followed a school delay, while the third followed a weekend. The scheduling of the band class was also found to exert some effect on his seizures. During the student’s first year of band, the class was scheduled in the afternoon. The seventh-grade band class was scheduled early in the morning. Another proposed link was that the student’s stress level in response to performance frustration increased his susceptibility to seizures.</p>
<p>Concurrently, while dialogue continued between the parents and school officials, the student’s private instructor discussed the case with the student’s general practitioner. Coincidentally, the doctor of record was also the student’s grandfather. Around this time, the student was referred for evaluation at a children’s specialty hospital. After the patient’s symptoms had been refractory to adjustments in medication, the student was referred to another academic medical institution for neurosurgical consultation in mid-March. Surgical intervention was recommended at that time for management of the child’s symptoms. A surgical procedure was immediately planned to help deal with the student’s condition.</p>
<p>While going through preoperative procedures, the student was unable to attend the school band’s winter concert, at which contest repertoire for the upcoming state band festival was previewed. While the student believed that he would be unable to participate in the state band festival, the child’s surgeons graciously granted the student the opportunity to partake in the festival performance. It was truly a memorable performance for the student, band members, and the directors, as well as a great opportunity for the other students to provide support to a classmate while reopening dialogue in the acceptance and understanding of his condition.</p>
<p>The student underwent an initial surgical procedure in which electrodes were used to locate the area in the brain responsible for the seizure activity, after which, further surgery might have been warranted to address the patient’s symptoms. However, due to the specific location in the brain involved and its proximity to other important neurologic structures, further surgical intervention for management of his symptoms was not ultimately chosen as an option for definitive treatment, electing instead for medical management with continued adjustment of his anticonvulsant medication. This strategy greatly reduced the frequency and severity of his seizures. During this period of treatment, the student’s classmates were able to stay informed of his condition and communicate with him via the Internet.</p>
<p>Following the surgery, the student was assigned a limited academic schedule, which did not include band, for the remainder of the school year. He was, however, granted permission to continue music study with summer private lessons. The private instructor noted that the student often experienced drowsiness, a known side effect of his medication.</p>
<p>As altered sleep patterns were identified as a trigger for these episodes, a regimented sleep schedule was also implemented, and the student was allowed to begin classes in midmorning. This prevented him from participating in second-period eighth-grade band, and he was accordingly enrolled in an afternoon session of seventh-grade band.</p>
<p>While in this class, the student developed a social disconnect with his original band classmates. The student had to identify with a new group of students and another band director. Due to the risk of spontaneous seizure activity, the student elected not to participate in marching band in high school, which led to greater separation between his original band classmates.</p>
<p>Four years after the surgery, the student is at a junior level in high school due to his altered class schedule. His seizures are relatively well controlled with medication, and he is otherwise healthy with no other chronic conditions. The student participated in freshman concert band but is not enrolled in the band program today. Although not in an organized instrumental ensemble, he continued to study trumpet with the same private instructor for an additional year. The student did not wish to participate in a band class due to his inability to control and predict the seizures coupled with presumed inevitable attention and social embarrassment associated with the seizures. The unpredictability of his disorder and the constant need for explanation and acceptance within the ensemble led the student to continue music study solely through private instruction. The student and his parents were made aware of this article and gave their consent for publication as well as permission to discuss this case with the student’s physician.</p>

<title>How Common Is Epilepsy?</title>
<p>Epilepsy, from the Greek word <italic>epile-psia</italic> (derived from <italic>epilambanein</italic>, “to seize or take”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432112451142">3</xref></sup>), is a neurological condition characterized by “the repeated occurrence of spontaneous bursts of neuronal over activity, known as seizures.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432112451142">4</xref></sup> The condition is estimated to affect 0.5 to 1 percent of the world’s population, with new diagnoses of epilepsy made in 40 to 70 per 100,000 people in industrialized countries such as the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432112451142">5</xref></sup> In fact, more than 326,000 children younger than age fifteen in the United States today carry the diagnosis of epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0027432112451142">6</xref></sup> An epidemiologic study regarding epilepsy in U.S. children from birth to seventeen years of age reported a prevalence of 6.3 cases per 1,000 children (0.6%).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0027432112451142">7</xref></sup> Manifestations of this condition can include motor phenomena, as illustrated in the preceding case, or sensory hallucinations or “auras,” depending on the area of the brain involved. In contrast to popular belief, not all seizures involve muscular spasms or a loss of consciousness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0027432112451142">8</xref></sup> A diagnosis of true epilepsy, as opposed to isolated seizures, requires two or more distinct episodes of seizure activity.</p>
<p>Neurons, like tiny batteries, use electrochemical energy to relay communication to, from, and within the brain about sensory information from the surrounding environment, the induction (initiation) of muscle fiber contraction, and the coordination of the body’s many homeostatic processes that maintain equilibrium among physiologic systems without the individual’s awareness. Therefore, anything that results in abnormal production, maintenance, or regeneration of this electrochemical balance in any part of the brain can produce seizure activity. Commonly recognized causes of epilepsy include genetic causes, as this condition is known to run in families;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0027432112451142">9</xref></sup> medical problems, including stroke, head trauma, or infection in the brain; or developmental conditions such as Down syndrome or autism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0027432112451142">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The location and size of the region of the brain affected can dictate the manifestations and degree of severity of the seizure activity displayed. This creates a wide spectrum of seizure presentations that can range from a mild inattentive appearance with no change in motor function to muscular rigidity of one or more extremities. Grand mal seizures overtake the entire body, leading to diffuse convulsions and loss of consciousness. It should be noted, however, that in many cases of epilepsy, a similar set of symptoms is generally exhibited in most, if not all, episodes. Triggers for seizures in some people with epilepsy have been identified, although in other cases, no trigger is ever identified. Stress in general, whether physical, mental, or emotional, has been hypothesized as a primary trigger for most cases of epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0027432112451142">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several instances of musicogenic epilepsy, or seizures triggered by hearing music, have been reported to date,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0027432112451142">12</xref></sup> and while many have been related to music in general, some cases have described seizures only as a result of hearing a specific song<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0027432112451142">13</xref></sup> or even, in one case, by a certain set of pitch frequencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0027432112451142">14</xref></sup> Recent advances in medical imaging technology have allowed neurologists to begin to determine the specific areas of the brain associated with musicogenic epilepsy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0027432112451142">15</xref></sup> improving understanding of these causative lesions as well as inspiring hope for future streamlined surgical treatment for this condition. In fact, music has also been suggested to exhibit a therapeutic effect on epileptics, with some studies claiming that the music of Mozart in particular has shown clinical effectiveness in ameliorating the severity of epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0027432112451142">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>While musicogenic epilepsy is a known neurological entity, a review of the literature provides only scant case reports of individuals experiencing seizures while performing music. The most notable was that of George Gershwin, who displayed seizure activity while conducting a 1937 performance of his Piano Concerto in F major, during which he maintained the beat and after a few moments recovered fully to finish the piece.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0027432112451142">17</xref></sup> Another interesting case described an elderly organist who experienced seizures as a result of playing a particular hymn, although singing, humming, or thinking about the same hymn produced no seizure activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0027432112451142">18</xref></sup> Another organist was described to demonstrate seizure activity while performing, and while the electrical discharge on the right side of the brain caused momentary disability in the left hand, the right hand remained flawless in execution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0027432112451142">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Epilepsy may also affect other aspects of the patient’s overall scholastic performance and daily life, as one study has reported that children with reported seizure disorders or epilepsy were more likely to have anxiety or depression, delays in development, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0027432112451142">20</xref></sup> This study also reported an increased risk of parent-reported limitations in abilities compared to other children without seizure disorders or epilepsy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0027432112451142">
<title>Considerations for Music Educators</title>
<p>Currently, educators are faced with many challenging situations in the classroom. Some of these situations may even be linked to serious medical conditions. In the case of epilepsy, increased knowledge and awareness of seizure presentations can afford the teacher an opportunity to participate in promoting the student’s health and the concern of the other students in the classroom. The music teacher in particular has a chance to monitor students under sometimes both mental and physical stress, which may lower the threshold for seizure activity. Daily awareness of visual and aural cues can sometimes allow the educator to catch one of the first events signaling a new diagnosis of epilepsy or seizure disorder. If atypical behaviors are identified, the student’s parents should be notified, as well as school counselors and administrators as needed, to ensure a concerted effort in the best interest of the child’s health. Symptoms for which to monitor, as suggested by the Mayo Clinic, include “temporary confusion, a staring spell, uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs, and complete loss of consciousness.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0027432112451142">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Parents and teachers should be counseled to seek medical attention for the student immediately if the seizure lasts longer than five minutes in duration, the student fails to resume breathing or a conscious state after the seizure, a second seizure occurs immediately after the first, the student has diabetes, or the student injures himself or herself during the seizure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0027432112451142">22</xref></sup> If the teacher witnesses what he or she believes to be a seizure, it is extremely important to document exactly what symptoms the student exhibited during the episode, as well as the length of time it lasted, and what was happening around the student when it occurred. This information can be very helpful to the child’s physician as a means of identifying the cause of the symptoms, as well as to maintain an accurate picture of the child’s overall health. Because the music educator may spend a much more substantial amount of time with a student as well as develop rapport with the student, the teacher’s insight into a change in daily behavior may be the key to discovering an underlying pathology such as epilepsy. As so many new diagnoses of this condition are made yearly, heightened surveillance for these symptoms on the part of the educator is warranted. If a student carries a diagnosis of epilepsy prior to enrollment, teachers and private instructors should be informed about the type of seizures already experienced, so as to remain cognizant of possible episodes, should they occur in the classroom.</p>
<p>While discernment of appropriate teaching objectives is a prime consideration in developing goals for all learners,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0027432112451142">23</xref></sup> students with epilepsy may benefit from specially designed teaching strategies in the music classroom to suit their needs. One potential solution involves the use of alternate forms of performance assessment. Assessments may be recorded, performed in a private or small-group setting. Since ensemble music is centered on the ability to perform and express with others, the individual performance is a part of the whole. With this concept in mind, a director may link assessment with the group. This concept allows the student to take the emphasis off the self and focus on his or her role as a part of the whole. Individual performance anxiety, while potentially leading to seizures among epileptic students, should be addressed with positive teaching strategies, to engender success in the classroom and overall performance and appreciation of music.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0027432112451142">
<title>A Community of Support</title>
<p>The relationships developed between students and music educators over a number of formative years create a sense of community. The music director and private instructor not only shape the musical lives of their students but also provide real-life situations that lead to acceptance and understanding needed later in life. Music educators are privileged to observe and shape students as they mature into young adults. As a member of this musical community, one of the responsibilities of the mentor or leader is to observe changes in behavior and actions. Changes in these areas may or may not be apparent in other classes that are offered on a onetime or single term basis but are more recognizable based on the contact hours accumulated from years of daily instruction.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that these situations exist within a larger professional context and must be approached with paramount discretion in the classroom. Foremost, the educator must respect the rights of parents to make unbiased decisions about the health of their child and whether to pursue medical treatment should these situations arise. The educator must also maintain the utmost in confidentiality in deference to the student’s and parents’ privacy, reporting only necessary information about these events to those who need to know to ensure the safety of the student (e.g., guidance or special-needs staff, administrators as appropriate, and naturally, the student’s parents). Any atypical behaviors observed in the classroom should be reported to the student’s parents promptly to ensure swift medical attention if needed. Seizure disorders and epilepsy should be managed by a physician, and early evaluation and management for these conditions may improve the affected student’s overall outcome. Medical attention for these disorders should not be delayed if any concerns for the student’s health arise.</p>
<p>Maximizing effectiveness in teaching the student with epilepsy presents a special challenge for the music educator. The frequent interaction with the student as not only a teacher but also a mentor and coach allows distinct insights into the student’s behavior on a daily basis. Should a seizure occur in the classroom, the teacher bears a responsibility to document details about the event to afford the greatest amount of diagnostic information for the student’s physician. Moreover, an open and frequent stream of dialogue should be facilitated between teachers and counselors, parents, and medical staff within the context of discretion and confidentiality and only with parental permission, ensuring a multifaceted team approach to managing the needs of the epileptic student to afford an optimal educational experience.</p>
