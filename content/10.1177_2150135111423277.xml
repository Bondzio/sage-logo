<abstract>
<p>In the last decade, there have been enormous advances in the field of pediatric-specific mechanical circulatory support. In the past, small children requiring bridge to transplant or recovery were limited to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Now, in various stages of development, there are several devices that offer the promise of the same quality of support enjoyed by older teenagers and adolescents, with the potential to substantially reduce transplant waiting list mortality and optimize transplant outcomes. Advances have been driven by both industry and, for the first time, by funding from the US National Institutes of Health.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the past few years, there has been an explosion of activity in the field of pediatric mechanical circulatory support (MCS), which is most commonly employed in a bridge-to-transplant strategy and less frequently in a bridge-to-recovery scheme. Prior to this time, the majority of children requiring MCS were placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), except for those relatively few children large enough to receive an adult ventricular assist device (VAD).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111423277">1</xref>

</sup> A recent analysis by Almond et al demonstrated that pediatric cardiac waiting list mortality is substantially higher among the smallest children, those for whom adult VADs are too large.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111423277">4</xref>
</sup> Although VADs specifically designed for small children had been developed in Germany as early as 1990,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111423277">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111423277">6</xref>
</sup> these had not been used in North America until the early part of the last decade,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111423277">7</xref>
</sup> since which time there has been near exponential increase in the use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR (Berlin Heart GmBH, Berlin, Germany) device in the United States and Canada, with more than 300 patients having been implanted in North America, at the time of this writing. At approximately the same time, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the US National Institutes of Health embarked on a multimillion dollar, multiyear, phased initiative to support the development of pediatric-specific MCS devices and systems, in recognition of the economic obstacles inherent in a relatively small size of the population in need of pediatric MCS.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111423277">8</xref>
</sup> With the completion of a prospective study of the Berlin Heart in children, plan to permit full US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluation and approval as well as the imminent initiation of the second phase of the NHLBI program,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111423277">9</xref>
</sup> the present review was undertaken to survey the current status of pediatric MCS and permit speculation and prediction about the future directions the field will take. This review will not include a discussion of current or future ECMO devices and systems nor will it include any discussion of newer temporary centrifugal VADs. Instead, the focus will be on so-called durable VADs, that is, those used with intended support duration of weeks to months (and occasionally beyond).</p>

<sec id="section2-2150135111423277">
<title>Current Devices</title>
<p>The vast majority of early pediatric VAD implants were adult devices, placed in teenagers and adolescents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111423277">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111423277">2</xref>
</sup> These VADs were predominantly first-generation, pulsatile devices and for the most part were placed in a paracorporeal arrangement,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111423277">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111423277">2</xref>
</sup> although a small number were “implantable” devices.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111423277">3</xref>
</sup> The greatest number of patients treated in this fashion received the Thoratec VAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, California), in either biventricular assist device (BVAD) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) configuration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111423277">2</xref>
</sup> In such larger patients, there have been recent reports of the use of newer second-<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111423277">10</xref>
</sup> and third-generation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111423277">11</xref>
</sup> devices. All these devices have required the use of significant anticoagulation and the rate of complications, while difficult to determine with certainty because of the small number of patients in whom they have been employed, has not been appreciably lower than the rate of similar complications in adult patients. There is no labeling constraint that would contraindicate the use of these devices in children, but none of the devices are approved for use in patients with a body surface area (BSA) of less than 1.3 m<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111423277">2</xref>
</sup>, which corresponds to a patient weight of approximately 50 kg.</p>
<p>The only device presently approved for use in children in the United States is the HeartAssist 5 (formerly known as the DeBakey VAD Child; Micromed Cardiovascular Inc, Houston, Texas), which received FDA approval in early 2004. The approval was granted for patients between 0.7 and 1.5 m<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111423277">2</xref>
</sup>, between ages 5 and 16. The device is an implantable axial flow pump designed for LVAD usage only, with a transcutaneous drive line. After the initial US implant in 2004, the device has not gained widespread acceptance predominantly because of thrombotic concerns, and very few additional reports of its usage have appeared in the literature.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>In 1989, an adult device developed at the German Heart Center in Berlin was modified in order to allow VAD placement in small children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111423277">5</xref>
</sup> The device is produced in a variety of sizes, with an applicable size range from 3 kg to full adult size. For approximately a decade, use of the device was confined to Germany and Western Europe. After the first usage of the device in the United States was reported in 2005,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111423277">7</xref>
</sup> there was widespread enthusiasm for its adoption in multiple centers in North America, all under the so-called compassionate use protocol.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111423277">15</xref>
</sup> This procedure required case-by-case approval by the FDA and local Institutional Review Board (IRB) to allow importation of each VAD into the United States. The cumbersome nature of this process inevitably extended the time between the decision to implant and the actual implantation operation. Despite the complexity of the approval sequence, the overwhelmingly positive experience at implanting centers led to the initiation in 2007 of a large multicenter trial constructed to potentially permit formal FDA approval of the device.</p>
<p>A similar pediatric-specific paracorporeal, pneumatic device, the MEDOS ventricular assist device (MEDOS Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany) was developed in Aachen, Germany.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111423277">6</xref>
</sup> Although a few reports of its usage have appeared,<sup>

<title>Current Issues</title>
<p>The most important current issue in pediatric VAD practice is the lack of an approved device with an acceptably low-risk profile and the versatility to provide durable support for the entire range of size and anatomic complexity. The recent experience with the Berlin Heart device has served to illuminate the desirability of a device meeting each of these criteria.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the most vexing problem in the field of MCS, shared in all generations of devices and patients of all ages and sizes, is the issue of arterial thromboembolism, especially with events involving the central nervous system. Although such events may be reversible, or only result in minor disability, in other circumstances the events may be devastating or even fatal. Despite multiple revolutionary and evolutionary advances in VAD design, the problem persists to such an extent that all approved and investigational devices that might be used in children require intense antithrombotic therapy. This typically includes both anticoagulation, with heparin (either unfractionated or low molecular weight) or warfarin, and antiplatelet medications. As an example, a protocol has been developed for use with the Berlin Heart<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135111423277">19</xref>
</sup> and is employed by essentially all implant centers in some form. The protocol involves the introduction of unfractionated heparin within the first day after implantation, in the absence of ongoing bleeding. This is later converted into either low-molecular-weight heparin or a vitamin K antagonist and combined with antiplatelet medications, most commonly aspirin and dipyridimole. Despite the use of such strategies, strokes have been described in most published experience, with rates typically in the range of 25% to 40%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150135111423277">20</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135111423277"/>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, anticoagulant-related bleeding has been a consistent problem in pediatric (and adult) VAD practice. The rates of bleeding and transfusion as well as the rate of surgical reexploration have been variable, but it can be said with certainty that none of these rates have approached zero. The transfusion requirement consequent in major bleeding is especially problematic for pretransplant VAD patients, in that exposure to foreign human leukocyte antigen (HLA) increases the likelihood of the development of anti-HLA antibodies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150135111423277">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Another Achilles heel of current VADs is the need for transcutaneous passage of either cannulas (in paracorporeal devices) or power cables (in case of “implantable” VADs). The ongoing breach of the skin barrier to microorganisms creates an enhanced vulnerability to infection, which will only be soluble with the development of true totally implantable devices. Despite this concern, it is exceedingly rare for patients to become “untransplantable” on the basis of a device-related infection.</p>
<p>Unique to pediatric VAD candidates is the issue of anatomic complexity related to congenital structural heart disease. This may be manifested in abnormalities of cardiac situs, in the case of dextrocardia or dextroversion of the cardiac apex. In other cases, the systemic ventricle may be a morphologic right ventricle, as in the case of a patient who has previously undergone an atrial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries, and this may require an alteration in VAD cannula shape or orientation (or both). Perhaps, the most difficult patients are those with univentricular hearts in whom the power source for pulmonary blood flow is either the failing ventricle or systemic venous pressure (either superior cavopulmonary connection or total pulmonary connection). Conventional VAD configurations do not account for the variations in pulmonary blood flow in children with single ventricle hearts, and consequently the experience with VAD support in these patients is very limited. A recent literature survey found only ten single ventricle patients implanted with VADs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2150135111423277">26</xref>
</sup> Of the ten patients reported, six went on to receive cardiac transplantation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150135111423277">
<title>Future Prospects and Predictions</title>
<p>In the short-term future, the FDA will render a decision about whether to approve the Berlin Heart VAD for routine used in the United States. The investigators and the company have extensively analyzed data derived from the prospective study undertaken to evaluate the device, and this analysis has been submitted to both the FDA and for publication. On July 21, 2011, after presentations by the Berlin Heart Company and the FDA, the Circulatory System Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee to the FDA voted unanimously that the Berlin Heart Device trial had demonstrated safety and probable benefit when used as a bridge to transplant in children. In the next several months, the FDA will issue its final decision about the approval of the device. In the event that approval is given, the device will likely achieve even wider usage than it has to date. Centers that have been put off by the compassionate use process, or skeptical about the device, will likely be influenced and further develop fledgling VAD programs. Furthermore, with the imprimatur in place, it is likely that the device implantation will be considered and accomplished much earlier in the course of children with end-stage cardiac disease, even at established programs. The time from demonstrated need to actual implantation should also be considerably shortened, particularly at centers which did not participate in the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) trial.</p>
<p>Initially, the expansion of the use of the Berlin Heart may result in slightly less favorable results as inexperienced centers learn to use the device. After that early phase, which it is hoped will be short-lived, in the longer term, the overall outcome should be favorable by reducing the waiting list mortality. It may be speculated that VAD-supported patients might even become better transplant candidates with the opportunity for improved nutrition and rehabilitation afforded by VAD support. Furthermore, the urgency to accept a marginally acceptable heart for a rapidly declining recipient may vanish, allowing optimization of patient-recipient matching.</p>
<p>Also, on the near horizon is the initiation of the second phase of the NHLBI-sponsored trial termed the Pumps for Kids, Infants, and Neonates (PumpKIN) Trial.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111423277">9</xref>
</sup> At time of this writing, a Data and Clinical Coordinating Center (DCCC) is being identified for the trial. After the DCCC is identified, with current plans calling for a contract to be awarded by early 2012, it is anticipated that clinical trials of the two VADs in the trial will begin, possibly by early 2013. The devices to be evaluated in the PumpKIN trial include two ECMO devices (Ension pCAS [Ension Inc, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and Levitronix PediPL [Levitronix LLC, Waltham, Massachusetts]), which will not be discussed further, and two VADs (the Pediaflow [Pediaflow VAD Consortium, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and the Jarvik 2000 [Jarvik Heart Inc, New York, New York]).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111423277">9</xref>
</sup> Both the VADs are implantable axial flow devices designed for left ventricular apical and aortic cannulation to allow support of the left ventricle. In some sense, these devices would therefore echo the generational advancements in adult VAD practice whereby the initial pulsatile devices have now been supplanted by continuous flow VADs. Flow rates from the two devices would permit complete systemic ventricular support for children in the 3 to 20 kg range. However, neither is capable of biventricular support. Furthermore, the degree of anticoagulation required for either is as yet undefined, as is the attendant stroke risk. Because the Berlin Heart has not yet been approved and because the PumpKIN device study design has not yet been finalized, speculation about study sample size for device evaluation and comparison of devices is not yet reasonable. Nor is it clear how the approval of the Berlin Heart device, should this occur, will impact the pace of enrollment of participants in the VAD arms of the PumpKIN trial. In the Berlin Heart IDE trial, a single-arm study in 15 centers required three years to enroll a total of 24 patients in the size range of patients who will be enrolled in the PumpKIN trial. Given that the PumpKIN trial will be a three arm study, comparing the two investigational devices to the Berlin Heart device, it seems likely that the duration of the PumpKIN trial will be at least as long as the Berlin Heart IDE trial, if not longer.</p>
<p>Beyond the Berlin Heart and PumpKIN devices, as durable VADs become better, for want of a better word, new applications for pediatric VAD support may emerge. For example, the concept of destination therapy has not yet been widely applied to children or adolescents. However, in children who have heart failure but are so highly sensitized as to not be candidates for transplantation, such a concept may be worth considering. In other participants, if the morbidity attendant to durable MCS can be reduced, an informed patient may elect to persist with MCS in preference to the well-know transplant-related morbidity (immunosuppression-related infection and malignancy, graft vasculopathy, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic renal failure, to name a few). At the 2010 Meeting of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, Dr O. H. Frazier proposed a new paradigm, whereby heart transplantation is reserved for the elderly individuals, and younger people are supported by cardiac pumps. This concept, somewhere between bridge to transplant and destination therapy, may be termed “bridge to postponement.” Such a scheme is not so far in the future as experience with MCS increase and new generations of devices emerge. In fact, in Western European adults, there were more VAD implants than heart transplants in 2010, and it is anticipated that a similar relationship of MCS to heart transplants will pertain in the United States in the near future.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2150135111423277">27</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the longer-term future, several other issues may significantly alter the practice of pediatric MCS. For example, in other areas of medicine, novel oral anticoagulant medications likely appear to provide more favorable risk–benefit profile than the traditionally used warfarin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2150135111423277">28</xref>
</sup> It may be anticipated that such agents may prove useful in MCS. As the science of pediatric MCS continues to evolve, the clinical observation that the Fontan operation is a bridge to transplant may need to be reconsidered. For children with complex congenital heart disease, we may someday tailor surgical strategies to create for them the optimal substrate to permit high-quality destination therapy with future MCS. Regardless of the specific advances in MCS that the future holds, it is clear that we are now much closer to our goal of durable mechanical support for children of all ages with a minimum of associated complications.</p>
