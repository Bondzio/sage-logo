<p>This article shows the serious gaps of competent healthcare professionals and physicians, especially in the rural areas in India. Besides this, it is also portrayed how the problem of poor quality in medical degrees resulted into less competent yet ‘qualified on paper’ healthcare professionals, creating a problem of delivering quality healthcare services in rural areas. The article tells about a proposed three-and-a-half years of Bachelor in Rural Medicine and Surgery (BRMS) degree designed exclusively to serve rural populations, by Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, which was rejected due to the fierce opposition by powerful medical lobbies and ‘qualified’ physicians in 2010.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 57 countries are experiencing alarmingly low levels of trained health personnel. Among them the scenario of India is quite depressing. The article depicts that India has only 0.69 doctors per 1,000 people. Quoting the WHO estimate, the article confirms that India cannot achieve the recommended target of ‘one doctor per 1,000 people’ till 2028. WHO recommends 2.8 healthcare professionals per 1,000, whereas India has 2 healthcare professionals per 1,000 people. More importantly the article focused on the problem of healthcare services in rural India, where 70 per cent of the population has only 0.39 doctors per 1,000 people. This gap is generally filled by the non-physicians in rural areas. But the problem of ‘prestige-based hierarchy’ in which physicians dominate and undermine the potential contributions from non-physician healthcare professionals is worsening the condition. The authors also showed the problem in global context by comparing various global scenarios regarding the scarcity of ‘qualified’ competent healthcare professionals in developing countries, and the ‘prestige based’ conflicts among the ‘qualified’ and the ‘non-qualified’ healthcare providers. The article confirms the presence of non-physician healthcare providers in rural India and also in various developing countries, which creates a workforce to provide basic healthcare services in the rural areas where the ‘qualified’ physicians can’t reach. But still the prestige-based hierarchy of medical professionals denies the importance of non-physician healthcare providers. In conclusion the authors suggest that, besides expanding the healthcare workforce, India also needs to create alternatives to the prestige-based hierarchies that rule the healthcare scenario. Therefore, empowerment of non-physician healthcare providers would not only increase the availability and accessibility to rural healthcare but also provide an empowered second line of authority, adding to the checks and balances that combat exploitation by powerful lobbies that dominate this knowledge-intensive service. Reviewing the global scenario the article suggests that empowering non-physician prescribers could indeed help fill gaps in rural healthcare. The article is an informative as well as suggestive one; it not only shows the ‘problematic’ picture but paves a way out for bridging the gap in the future healthcare plans.</p>
