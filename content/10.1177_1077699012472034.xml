<p>Finally, somebody has taken on the massive task of writing an overall assessment of the origins and early development of the move toward deregulating media. Jennifer Holt teaches film and media studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and has waded through a morass of truly boring documentary evidence to craft this survey of what happened and why.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on electronic media, for they were (and television still is) more heavily regulated than film or print media. That said, given this history ends in 1996, it is a decidedly pre-Internet analysis; this is all about “legacy” services.</p>
<p>A key theme in Holt’s findings is the degree to which these industries were, even then, interconnected—and are now even more so. As film, broadcast, and cable grew from fundamentally separate industries to interconnected, synergistic components of global media conglomerates, the concepts of vertical and horizontal integration (and potential antitrust legal action against same) were redesigned.</p>
<p>Yet the legal basis of why broadcasting was more closely regulated is that—unlike print, film, or cable—stations must be licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). That provision, which dates back a century to the Radio Act of August 1912, is the basis for FCC regulatory forays to ensure licensees are operating in the (as the law puts it) “public interest, convenience or necessity.” What that phrase really means is up to the FCC members of any given time. To an extent, then, this is a study of changing definitions.</p>
<p>Despite the legal licensing requirement, the parameters of market concentration and consolidation—and government scrutiny of same—began to shift as America’s politics changed under the 1981–89 Reagan administration. (Indeed, it can be argued that the process of FCC deregulation began perhaps five years earlier during the Ford administration.)</p>
<p>This first attempt to understand and contextualize overall patterns, causes, and results of the move to deregulate provides important background to the policy debates of today.</p>
