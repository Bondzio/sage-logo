<p>Andrew C. Sparkes, PhD, is a professor of sport &amp; body pedagogy in the Faculty of Education, Community &amp; Leisure at Liverpool John Moores University, England. His research interests revolve around the ways that people experience different forms of embodiment over time in a variety of contexts. Recent work has focused on performing bodies and identity formation, catastrophic spinal cord injury in sport and the narrative reconstruction of self, and ageing bodies. These interests are framed by a desire to develop interpretative forms of understanding via the use of life history, ethnography, and narrative approaches.</p>

<abstract>
<p>In this article the author seeks to explore the dynamics of father–son relationships by calling upon bits and pieces of memory and representing them through poetic forms and vignettes. Issues of embodiment, ageing, social class, masculinity, sport, and vulnerability as multilayered and interrelated phenomena pervade the text. The constraining and enabling influence each of these can have on emerging senses of body-self and how they are transmitted across generations is hinted at throughout. It is hoped that readers might add their own bits and pieces in the full acknowledgment that memories are tricksters and shape shifters.</p>

<p>In the title of his book Blake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800411429095">Morrison (1993)</xref> asks the intriguing question: <italic>And When Did You Last See Your Father?</italic> It made me think hard about when I last saw my father and my son, Alexander, saw me. I don’t think we ever see our fathers as a totality, just in bits and pieces that float by in the currents that toss and turn the memories of the flesh over time. So, here are some of the bits and pieces that experientially connect my father, my son, and me.</p>
<p>A comment my father uses often when I speak to him about episodes from his life is “I could write a book about it.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Book of life</bold></p>
<p>“I could write a book about it”</p>
<p>You often say about your life.</p>
<p>I wish you would Dad.</p>
<p>To read your take on the whole</p>
<p>Would be better than the bits and pieces I know.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>How would the chapters in your book unfold?</p>
<p>What moments would you select to remember?</p>
<p>Which memories would choose you without your say?</p>
<p>What would we learn of each other along the way?</p>
<p>How might your story create a new dawn or destroy the day?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If I dived into the text and swam between your words</p>
<p>Would I know you any better and understand your regrets?</p>
<p>Looking behind the letters should you try and hide there</p>
<p>Would this exposure make me love you any less?</p>
<p>Such possibilities are scary and make me gasp for breath.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And what would I do with this story of your life?</p>
<p>This life, in bits and pieces, so neatly arranged on the page.</p>
<p>Devour it whole or savour it in segments?</p>
<p>Lovingly caress it or tear it with rage?</p>
<p>Just like us, stories are uncontrollable once out of the cage.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like many “old” people, my father, long since divorced from my mother, lives alone and lives with loneliness. Clinical depression has been a constant companion throughout his life, but it now regularly feeds on him. He is financially comfortable, but his friends and social network have literally died away. Showing me a picture of himself as a young man in a football team he says: “I’m the last one alive of this lot.” His memory of the distant past is excellent, but the present is more problematic and confusions often prevail. Recently we had a conversation about me taking on the power of attorney—“just in case.” This is the first time we have spoken of such things. My father often recites the birth dates of my brother and me to prove his mind is in good order. This he knows, but has forgotten the actual day of my birthday when it happens for the past two years and sent no card. He feels guilty when he remembers that he hasn’t remembered. I tell him not to worry—but I worry.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Right now</bold></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He’s 85 and still likes to jive</p>
<p>But, all friends have died.</p>
<p>In his flat late at night he dances alone</p>
<p>To music from a bygone era.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Now 86, still no walking stick</p>
<p>Just a painful left knee that hurts climbing stairs.</p>
<p>This embodied intrusion bemuses him.</p>
<p>He seeks explanation from sporting days long past.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Before, he made things happen. Now they happen to him.</p>
<p>Isolated, ruminating, lonely, a deep depression sets in.</p>
<p>Memories distorted by bitter regrets and recriminations.</p>
<p>Can he make the choice now to diminish or grow?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Despite thinking that he knows the script to come</p>
<p>When he assumes to know the ending already in sight.</p>
<p>Hearing his tales and laughter about the old days,</p>
<p>I know that deep inside burns an irresistible light.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>My Grandfather, a constable in the police force, died from meningitis when my father was only two years of age. I only have one picture of him standing in his uniform, looking very awkward in a studio setting. Often, I wonder what it was like growing up without a father being there for the times he was needed, growing up without a role model to provide a narrative map, and a story line for his own fatherhood with my younger brother and me.</p>
<p><disp-quote>

</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can hold my father.</p>
<p>My son can hold me.</p>
<p>At times we need to and do.</p>
<p>Not so, when your father dies when you are only two.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My father helped with my homework from school.</p>
<p>The same goes for me and my son, it’s nothing new.</p>
<p>As fathers we both tried not having much of a clue.</p>
<p>Not so, when your father dies when you are only two.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Fathers roll footballs to your feet and teach you the tricks of the trade.</p>
<p>They feel pride when accurate and beautiful kicks are made.</p>
<p>He did this for me and for my son too.</p>
<p>Not so, when your father dies when you are only two.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At matches, fathers patrol the lines on the side.</p>
<p>Their muscles twitch involuntarily as their sons turn the tide.</p>
<p>This day is theirs to shout and praise but never boo.</p>
<p>Not so, when your father dies when you are only two.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When bodily change, like those in adolescence, creep up on you.</p>
<p>Fathers are there to confirm that the world has not gone askew.</p>
<p>At the time, sons rarely take much notice of his view.</p>
<p>Not so, when your father dies when you are only two.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Through transformational life phases, fathers stick around.</p>
<p>They help to keep their son’s feet on the ground.</p>
<p>Letting them know they are always there whatever they do.</p>
<p>Not so, when your father dies when you are only two.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And so it goes on this father–son stuff.</p>
<p>A lifetime of unconditional love with its peaks and troughs.</p>
<p>The story goes that together you see it all through.</p>
<p>Not so, when your father dies when you are only two.</p>

<p>My employment has always been some distance from my parental home. I don’t get to see enough of my Dad (or my Mum) as I, and they, would like me to. This fills me with a deep guilt and makes me wonder whether I have been a “good” son to them and how I might fulfil this role in their remaining years. Recently, I broke up my journey from my new university job to home with a detour to see them both. As always, my Mum fed me. In contrast, my Dad showed me an “emergency” set of false teeth he keeps in a jacket pocket should he lose the pair that currently inhabit his mouth. He wants me to know where they are in case he is ever ill and has to go into hospital. Teeth are a key issue in my Dad’s life. The tales he tells about them are both humorous and revealing.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077800411429095">
<title>Teeth Tales</title>
<p>When my Dad was a boy, and after the premature death of his own father, he and his Mum struggled to get by financially. My Grandmother took in lodgers to make ends meet, but money was always tight. For her, as what might be described as a “respectable working-class” woman, this was demeaning. As a boy, my Dad certainly found this so and it was a constant reminder that he was “poor.” He often uses the word <italic>degrading</italic> to sum up his experiences of boyhood and his stories are laced with items that could not be afforded. For example, when he moved from junior to secondary school he could not afford long trousers and was the only one in his year wearing short trousers—<italic>degrading</italic>. His mother made him a pair of long trousers, but they were obviously made and not bought—<italic>degrading</italic>. His teeth were also a source of deep anxiety and ongoing <italic>degradation</italic>.</p>
<p>Teeth, their number and condition, are a marker of social class. As a boy, dental care was another of those things that could not be afforded. Even when a rare visit was arranged, my Dad’s fear of the relative brutality dished out by dentists in those days meant that rarely did his teeth actually get any treatment.</p>
<p>He used to ring the doorbell of the dentist’s, to be able to say truthfully to his Mother that he had been there, but then simply ran away before anybody had time to answer the door. For a number of years this tactic worked until, one day, having rung the bell and turning to run, my Dad bumped straight into the dentist who had been having his lunch (i.e., some beers) at the local pub opposite. Having been marched in my Dad thought, for a moment, that he was saved when the dentist could not find the pincers required to remove a couple of bad teeth. The respite did not last long, as searching his jacket the dentist found the pincers in the same pocket that he kept his well-used pipe that he took a puff on before completing his professional task of painful extractions.</p>
<p>This lack of dental care took its toll on my Dad’s teeth and this came into the foreground when, towards the end of the Second World War, he passed his tests to train for a pilot in the RAF. At the medical, he was told that he would need at least seven teeth extracted before he could proceed with the training. It was not long before he was wearing a full set of dentures that became a constant reminder to him of his poor background and a source of deep vulnerability and shame in terms of what was already a fragile sense of masculinity.</p>
<p>My Dad’s teeth also caused much family laughter. My Mum used to despair at the number of times she would get into the passenger seat of their car only to sit on a set of Dad’s false teeth that he had taken out whilst driving. Another story is legendary, and I was there when it happened as a young boy. We had a family outing to the seaside, about a two-hour trip from where we lived, so it was always something special. The bit of coast we visited was beautiful, with big sandy dunes for me to play on and a gently sloping shelf to the beach making it safe for me to swim. In the morning, my Dad and I were in the water throwing a plastic football to each other when a big wave hit him from behind and his false teeth shot out of his mouth. Despite an extended search we could not find them. But not to worry, he had a spare set at home waiting for him when we returned in the evening. The sunny day passed and was enjoyed by all despite the absence of teeth in my Dad’s mouth.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon we began walking along the shore line back to the car park. Some way along there were two women paddling in the sea when one let out a yelp as she stood on something sharp. After an athletic hop she bent down to retrieve the offending object only to pick up my Dad’s false teeth that he had lost five hours earlier. They had since been washed down the beach by the tide. Holding them in her hand she laughed and was showing them to her friend when my Dad casually walked over and said, “Thanks, they’re mine,” before popping them into his mouth and walking off as if nothing strange had happened.</p>
<p>In conversations now, my Dad constantly refers to his teeth. Sometimes with humor, and sometimes with anger, when they cause him pain and prevent him eating certain foods. Most often he talks with regret. He simply wishes he had been given the chance to have his own teeth as a young man.</p>

<title>The Sporting Body</title>
<p>During primary school my Father was a sickly child and was absent for long periods due to bronchitis and other chest infections. He felt isolated and detached from the other children as they played in the street and went off to school. His Mother tended to view him as “precious” and became overly protective of him when he attended secondary school. She tried to prevent him taking part in physical education lessons. All this was to no avail as one of the teachers encouraged my Dad to play football for the school team and even lent him the kit and boots that he could not afford to buy.</p>
<p>For his part, my Dad did not tell his Mother he was playing football, but did so every week, played extremely well, and loved the game as it became his proving ground at school as an adolescent boy. Football and other team games were the making of my Dad in relation to developing a specific kind of masculine identity and bodily style. Here, another “regret” that haunts my Dad is that he did not take the chance to turn professional when he was offered a contract as a young man. The main reason for turning it down was that he needed to support his Mother financially. Back then, the maximum wage for a professional footballer was eights pounds per week. As a shoe cutter in a factory he was able to earn good money with overtime, and combined with the “boot money” he got for playing football each week, my Dad earned more than this eight pound maximum. He simply could not afford to turn professional. Plus, like he says to me so often, he didn’t have a Dad to encourage him to take the chance. Perhaps this is why my Dad has always encouraged me to “have a go” and supported me even when the things I wanted to do didn’t make sense to him.</p>
<p>Sport played a crucial role in “making me” and constructing my relationship with my Dad and my son Alexander. I remember my Dad rolling the football to me as a young boy so that I learned to control it and kick with both feet. This was the source of great satisfaction to him when on making my first-class debut as a rugby player, aged seventeen, a newspaper report of the game headlined with “Andy Sparkes makes a bright start” before mentioning my all-round display and my kicking of conversions and penalties with either foot depending on which side of the pitch I was on.</p>
<p>Sport seems to have infused our bodies over time and across generations. I have spent hours kicking or hitting balls of various kinds with Alexander. I have spent hours watching him train, play, and simply <italic>be</italic> in those joyous moments of movement.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Watching a script unfold</bold></p>
<p>Standing back from the other parents, not shouting, I watch.</p>
<p>Short blond hair shines. A body moves with grace into spaces not available to others.</p>
<p>Balance shifts imperceptibly. Drifting, elements blend together in a moment.</p>
<p>The ball is his to control, caress and release, a playmaker.</p>
<p>Standing back from the other parents, not shouting, I watch.</p>
<p>Crescendo. A game won. Hands are shaken. Water pours into dry throats.</p>
<p>The coach declares with a massive smile: “Alexander, you were brilliant today. <italic>Brilliant!</italic>”</p>
<p>Bemused, the boy asks, “Why?”</p>
<p>Standing back from the other parents, not shouting, I watch.</p>
<p>Talented, skilful, fast, and strong, my eight-year-old son.</p>
<p>Constructing a performing identity on the run.</p>
<p>Love and pride infuse the tears that soon will come.</p>
<p>Standing back from the other parents, not shouting, I watch.</p>
<p>Embodied memories connect my flesh to him.</p>
<p>In shared movement, in sinews, masculinities crystallise.</p>
<p>Him-I-he-me-we-touching trajectories in time and space.</p>
<p>Standing back from the other parents, not shouting, I watch.</p>
<p>A ghost brushes against me.</p>
<p>My skin shivers.</p>
<p>This script has been lived before.</p>

<title>Willow Sounds</title>
<p>I watch the heavy rain outside. It’s a typical July day in England. I suspect the cricket practice tonight will be cancelled and know how this will disappoint Alexander, my thirteen-year-old son. He stands across from me in the specialist shop, picking up and swinging, various hand-made cricket bats in anticipation of his birthday in several days’ time. For over thirty minutes this ritual has taken place and the choice has now narrowed down to three bats. Each one is picked up, held out at arm’s length, swung, twisted, and swished through the air. The tall, sun-bronzed, assistant is called upon for advice. He gives the technical low-down on each bat and speaks of the modifications that make the “sweet spot” form lower in these than in “normal” cricket bats. The weights of the bats are different, 2.10, 2.11, and 2.13 pounds, respectively. More swishing, more shadow shots.</p>
<p>We are now down to a choice of two bats. Square cuts, off drives, and forward defensives are mimed as imaginary balls flash to the boundary on the way to a future test century for England. I become fascinated at the repetitive movements involved. I watch the intense concentration on Alexander’s face as he feels how each bat moves and performs in the air under his command. Despite all this, he remains unsure. The assistant recognizes and understands Alexander’s dilemma. How to differentiate between two excellent hand-made willow cricket bats? Without hesitation he goes to the counter and picks up a cricket mallet that to me looks like a large round wooden hammer. He then picks up one of the bats, holds it out in front of him with his left hand, and then proceeds to hit it hard with the mallet about fifteen times: pang-pang-pang-pang! Alexander and he listen with rapt attention.</p>
<p>The same procedure is carried out with the other bat. All our ears listen to the staccato hammering: <italic>ping-ping-ping-ping</italic>! The attendant picks up the first bat again and administers another series of hits: <italic>pang-pang-pang-pang</italic>! “Listen to the difference” he says to Alexander who acknowledges him with a knowing nod of the head. The other bat is given the same treatment again: <italic>ping-ping-ping-ping</italic>! “Hear the difference?” he asks Alexander, “The sweet-spot on this one is better. The wood on the other one is tighter but this one has the better sweet-spot. Personally, I’d go for this one.” Alexander smiles: He has heard the difference and agrees. His ears have made the final choice on the new cricket bat.</p>
<p>I have never played cricket and know hardly anything about the game. But today, I have learned something about its sounds and, through listening to the tunes and rhythms played on willow bats, I have been able to share a precious embodied moment of “secret” knowing with my son.</p>

<sec id="section4-1077800411429095">
<title>Leather</title>
<p>September is my favorite month of the year. The cricket season is over. Bats and pads along with the by-now slightly off-white clothing get zipped into large bags and are left to hibernate. The colors of the autumn landscape shimmer as the leaves begin their journey from green to golden brown. Despite its attempt to match the summer sun, the light is paler in its golden intensity as it saturates the still air, providing a sense of calm while it waits for the chills of winter to arrive.</p>
<p>A marker of this change is the buying of football boots for the new season. Again, I watch my son Alexander, now just fourteen years of age but already six-foot tall, eyeing up the formidable rack of boots at the Sports Mega-Store. As he holds them up for inspection I recognize some of the logos. The three stripes of <italic>Adidas</italic>, and the flash of <italic>Nike</italic>. Most of all, I recognize the white feline outline on the <italic>Puma</italic> boots—my favorite brand. Alexander picks up a pair of these and asks the assistant for a size 11. As the morose and monosyllabic assistant disappears into the bowels of the Mega-Store to retrieve them, I take the opportunity to do his job (done abysmally up to now) and sing the praises of the <italic>Puma</italic> football boot. Their extra width, their suppleness, their low-cut heel, the reinforced sole, and, most important of all, the softness of the leather.</p>
<p>Like most aged fathers I am a source of extreme, but I hope not irreversible, embarrassment to my adolescent son. My public oration meets with a stern and dismissive look that reminds me how on occasions such as these my role is to be seen and not heard except to say “Yes” when required and to pay for the purchase. I recognize my place. So I dutifully sit, watch, and listen as he tries on the <italic>Puma</italic> boots. He then takes them off and holds them up for close inspection, bending them and feeling the leather. Then he hands them to me asking, “What do you think?”</p>
<p>Like him I bend the boot and run my fingers over its surface. Next, I lift the boot to my nose and inhale the smell of leather. In so doing, the scene is transformed. I move back in time, and it is <italic>me</italic> trying on my first “proper” pair of football boots when I was eleven years of age, in a small local sports shop, miles away from here in a different space. Seated close by my father, the former semiprofessional footballer, watches me intensely. He asks me to stamp my feet with the boots on. He asks me where my toes are and to wiggle them. As I wiggle my toes he feels for their position in the boot. They feel so good. I take them off and hand them to him. My father bends them and feels the leather. He also, like me a generation later, smells them. Having spent many years as a shoe cutter in a factory, he knows about leather. There is a nod of approval. The <italic>Puma</italic> boots are mine. I am elated.</p>
<p>The smell and feel of leather football boots connects the bodies of a grandfather, a father, and a son across time. My father has often told Alexander and me stories of what it was like to play football in the 1940s and 1950s. How chunky and solid the boots were compared to the “slippers” of today and how the studs were nailed in rather than screwed in. There are also stories of the football itself. How, as it was not waterproof, it used to get heavier in the rain as the game went on so that by the end heading it was like taking a punch from a boxer! How the players got cuts on their heads from the loose stitching of the ball and the tongue bulging through. Stories of a tougher game, for tougher times, and for tougher men than today’s pampered, overpaid superstars.</p>
<p>For his eightieth birthday I bought my father an old leather football from an antique shop. When I gave it to him he held it, caressed it, rubbed it against his cheek, and then he smelt the deep brown, faded leather. As he did so, I could see him drift back in time, into a body he had inhabited so many years ago. Then he began to tell me stories about his playing career and past life for working-class boys like him. Stories of team mates, their talents, and the laughs they had, though, sadly, most are now dead. Of big games, local rivalries, triumphs, and losses. Of travel in old cars to mining villages to play hard men on hard pitches. Of players who made it into the professional game and the reasons why he couldn’t make this choice for so many reasons.</p>
<p>As always, I soak up his stories, as these are the stories that have played their part in shaping my father, me, and Alexander. Before I leave, my father thanks me again for the football and jokingly says that it won’t be long before he passes it on to me for safe keeping. I don’t like the thought but know that on the day he does, I will become the guardian of the old, faded, leather football that is so full of stories before, in time, passing it on to Alexander so that he can add his own.</p>

<title>Something You Need to Know</title>
<p>August 2009, Kitty is diagnosed with breast cancer. Sometime during that swirling month of disorientation, tears, fears, and intense embraces we sit down with Jessica (aged eighteen) and Alexander (aged fifteen) to tell them about the diagnosis and what it will mean and might mean. In terms of what it will mean they are told, by me, that Mummy has breast cancer and that she will have to have a mastectomy, followed by aggressive chemotherapy, and then finally a course of radiotherapy. These are facts I relay as facts, holding on to them like a drowning man hangs on to driftwood to stop the undertow pulling him down into the depths. Also as a fact, I tell them that during the chemotherapy Kitty will lose her incredibly beautiful long, dark, curly hair. Mummy will be bald. Mummy will feel sick. Mummy will be poisoned by chemicals in order to keep her alive. These facts linger in the air.</p>
<p>Not knowing what to expect, having said all this without taking a breath for fear of floundering, I look at Jessica and Alexander to gage their reaction. Suddenly, I realise that these “facts” don’t mean anything to them and won’t until they actually happen. Right now, sitting across the room from them next to me, holding my hand, is their mother who looks and is “perfectly healthy” except for the invisible assassin that has chosen to invade her body. All they have really heard is the word <italic>CANCER</italic> and the look in their eyes asks me one question only:</p>
<p>“Is Mummy going to die?”</p>
<p>I am unable to use the word <italic>DIE</italic> or <italic>DEATH</italic> in front of them, in front of Kitty, in front of myself. Right now, I will not allow these words into the conversation. Fighting back the tears and rage inside me I indirectly address their question by giving one version of what might happen. My mouth speaks of the value of catching the cancer early, of the sophistication of modern cancer treatments, and the good statistical chances of all this helping Kitty to get better again and return to health. Hoping I will never have to tell them an unspeakable truth I tell Jessica and Alexander: “We will always tell you the truth if you ask us a question about what’s going on and we’ll try and explain things as they happen.” They nod their assent knowing already that this is a lie as I have just avoided the crucial question their eyes screamed at me.</p>
<p>Jessica returns to university in the October. She sees less of the facts in action during the next year. For Alexander, he is there with them the whole time as he takes on the additional pressures of GCSE examinations. Soon after the mastectomy the chemotherapy begins. Kitty gets her long curly hair cut short so that what is to come is less of a shock to her and to us. But, it’s not. Gradually the hair falls out in strands and small batches. Then one night, while I am training at the gym, Kitty takes a shower and her hair falls out in handfuls. Massive sodden clumps swirl around the tray. When I return, she sits in tears on the settee being cuddled by Alexander. I kneel down, fold them in my arms in a tight embrace around both of them until their bodies tell me it is OK to let go.</p>
<p>That night, as I walk by Alexander’s room I hear him sobbing. I knock quietly—no answer. Gently, I push the door open. Through the light from the hallway I can see his powerful muscular frame lying on his side with his arms over his head, crying, just crying. I lie beside him and hold is heaving body close to my own. I feel his breathing and touch the tears on his face.</p>
<p>“Hey Big Fella—love you,” I whisper.</p>
<p>He responds with a momentary relaxation of the shoulder muscles.</p>
<p>“Love you Big Fella,” I whisper again. “Thanks for looking after Mum tonight. Now forget about being brave and just let it go with your Dad here beside you.”</p>
<p>And he does let go, until exhausted he begins to melt towards sleep. I release him and slide to the floor where I lie looking at a chink of light from the street lamp that comes though a crack in the curtains. My body begins to relax to the rhythm of Alexander’s breathing as I reflect on the moment that has just enveloped us as father and son.</p>
<p>“Dad what are you doing?” A sleepy voice says to me.</p>
<p>“Remember when I used to read bedtime stories to you and, afterwards, you always made me lie on the floor until you went to sleep? Well, that’s what I’m doing tonight. No matter how big you get or how old you are I’ll always be there to tell you stories and lie on the floor till you go to sleep.”</p>
<p>“Thanks Dad. Love you too.”</p>
<p>“So you should,” I joke.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget to wake me early for the game tomorrow.” The last words he exhales before folding himself into the cocoon of slumber.</p>
<p>I remain on the floor for some while as a host of emotions ebb and flow through my tired and troubled body. When the tears eventually stop streaming down the sides of my face forming small damp patches on the carpet, I slowly take my leave to make sure that Alexander’s football boots are polished, clean, and dry for the game tomorrow—just like my Dad always did for me when I was a boy.</p>

<title>It’s a Boy</title>
<sec id="section7-1077800411429095">
<title>August 9, 1990</title>
<p>Jessica Rachael Sparkes is born. I am ecstatic. I am a father. Most important, I am a Father to a <italic>daughter</italic>. In my naivety I believe I am absolved from the constraining confines of performative and hegemonic masculinity by the random allocation of her gender at conception. I did not feel ready to father a son. Aged thirty-five, too many anxieties prevailed about my own sense of embodiment and how this would shape the experiences of a boy growing up with me. I feared the implicit pressures my history of bodily and social practices would have on him. I feared the spaces he might be forced to inhabit on his journey from childhood to manhood and the part I might unknowingly play in this process.</p>
<p>Spaces that as well as giving me immense pleasure also caused me psychic and physical pain, leaving me feeling isolated, confused, marginal, and vulnerable for not being the “real man” that other people expected and wanted me to be. Others have also been hurt by being placed in such spaces. I recall the tough time my younger brother by eight years had when he went to the same secondary school as me. How tired he was at constantly being asked by the teachers, “Are you the brother of Andrew Sparkes?” and then being told, “He was such a brilliant sportsman.” Such comparisons made it difficult for him to develop his own identity in the school. They corroded our relationship at that time and for a number of years afterwards.</p>
<p>With the birth of Jessica came a sense of release. Part of the release was from competitive sport. In the interests of gender equity I introduced Jessica to a range of physical activities and sports when she was young. Despite being very athletic she was not drawn to any of these and found her bodily pleasures in art, music, and drama to be far more satisfying and sustaining.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077800411429095">1</xref></sup> So with Jessica came the invitation to enter a different world and engage with it in ways that were new to me. I willingly accepted this invitation and was humbled by what she taught me then as a girl. I remain equally humbled by what she is teaching me now as a young woman about herself and the landscape we inhabit together in our different ways with those around us. Needless to say, some of these lessons have not been easy. I am still grappling with many of the questions Jessica’s being in the world poses for me and willingly surrender myself to the mystery that is her.</p>
<p>For Jessica, my sporting background and the bodily injury this has produced has been of little direct relevance to her. This is not to say that my body has not been read in various ways by her and her friends over the years, sometimes in amusing ways. For example, Jessica tells me her early boyfriends found my physicality intimidating and thought that because of my rugby background I was a “hard case” to be wary of only to find I was the “cuddly bear” she told them I really was. In contrast, I think I always knew that whether I liked it or not my historical performing body would always play a significant but different role in shaping Alexander’s corporeal experiences from the moment he was born.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why I felt panicked on August 12, 1994, when the midwife announced to Kitty and me “It’s a boy” and Alexander Jacob Sparkes entered the world. The word “boy” shook me and flooded me with anxiety. “It’s a boy”: so simple a statement but so immensely complex for me to handle right then. Perhaps that’s why I found it difficult to bond with Alexander just after he was born. Kitty tells me that initially I was distant from him and that it took about a year for me to relax and make connections with Alexander. That I appeared “distant” from my son fills me with angst and remorse. The truth might be that I was full of confusion about masculine identities and embodiment and how best to connect with Alexander in ways that did not contaminate him with my own insecurities, doubts, fears, and vulnerabilities. Needless to say, as a deep love drew us closer and closer all these worked their way into our relationship in their own fashion. One example will have to suffice.</p>
<p>I remember when Alexander played his first game of rugby. It was for his school team when he was fourteen years of age. Taking up my position away from the other parents, I watched him intently. At one point, early in the first half, his body was directly lined up with mine when he executed a sublime side-step and then an exquisite body swerve to leave the opposition floundering in his wake before scoring a try. Simultaneously, the sinews and synapses in my own body reacted to his movement, my weight shifted onto one foot with the side-step and my body literally swayed with his body swerve. In that fleeting moment our bodies, separated by a generation in time, were synchronized in exaltation to something both within and beyond ourselves. My flesh was flushed and buzzed with memories of a body I inhabited many years ago.</p>
<p>At one level this experience excited me. At another it scared me. Alexander’s movements in that moment reminded me too much of a former me long ago. The same might be said when I watched him play other sports, but this was rugby. Despite his obvious talents for any sport involving a ball, I realize now that subconsciously I tried to keep Alexander away from rugby. This did not go unnoticed by family and friends who would often ask me about my apparent reluctance to give Alexander the support for rugby that I gave him in other sports. At the time I rationalized my lack of enthusiasm in terms of protecting him from the dangers of overtraining should he become involved in too many activities, this being especially so given that his football team was consistently winning league and cup doubles, which took up a lot of his time. Time, I also argued, needed to be spent on school work and music lessons.</p>
<p>Various friends have cut through this somewhat delusional rationalization with such questions as follows: “Don’t you think that your reluctance is more to do with your fear of Alexander becoming like you in that you played top-class rugby but had your career prematurely terminated by a lower back injury? And, don’t you think it has a lot to do with the research you do on sports people with ‘broken’ bodies like the men you interviewed who suffered catastrophic spinal cord injury (SCI) in rugby and became disabled?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077800411429095">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such questions have made me reflect on some deep-rooted anxieties that I hold about the injured, impaired, and disabled body.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077800411429095">3</xref></sup> As a young athlete I felt invincible; serious injury was what happened to other people not me. But then it did. My elite playing career was over, and I experienced my first devastating sense of bodily “betrayal.” Over the years, this has returned on a number of occasions most associated with an ongoing lower back “problem” that often intrudes into my life in the form of acute bouts of pain and immobility. I’ve also had three surgical operations to remove prolapsed lumbar discs at the L2/3, L3/4, and L5/S1 levels, and an operation on my left shoulder to “clean up” and repair it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077800411429095">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>All this has heightened my sense of vulnerability with regard to my own embodiment. I would like to think these experiences have made me more sympathetic and empathetic toward those whose own body projects have been interrupted due to circumstances beyond their control. But deep-rooted fears remain. For me, this feared self is not now associated with sport as I no longer play any but it remains connected through my body to that of Alexander who does play contact sports, including rugby. This, in turn, links him to the bodies of the men I have met as part of my research on the narrative reconstruction of the body-self following catastrophic SCI and my historical self as “might have been.” I resonate with the fears (rational or otherwise; disabling and disablist or otherwise) of a father about what my son might become and what this would mean for him, for me, his mother, his sister, and others, even if Alexander is not aware of this possibility himself.</p>
<p>All of which has made me ponder how I would have reacted as a young man if I had become disabled through sport due to catastrophic SCI and how I would react if it happened to Alexander. As I write this, I shudder. My stomach churns and I feel a wave of anxiety. I feel sick and want to block out such thoughts and feelings. The deep visceral nature of my feelings is as inescapable as it is indescribable.</p>
<p>My Dad often reflects on what would have happened if the back injury had not prematurely terminated my first-class rugby playing career. Back then, the game was amateur. Now it is professional and there is a good living to be made for the top players. He often says to me, “You were born in the wrong time.” He also has told me on several occasions that he feels guilty about my back injury and wonders whether it is a case of the “sins of the father” being visited on the son. I began to get a sense of what he meant when Alexander, aged twelve, was diagnosed with Osgood Schlatter’s Disease. This is one of the most common causes of knee pain in young athletes. It causes swelling, pain, and tenderness just below the knee, over the shin bone. Osgood-Schlatter commonly affects boys who are having a growth spurt during their preteen or teenage years and is most common in young athletes who play football, soccer, or basketball or are involved in gymnastics and ballet.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>The body says “No.”</bold></p>
<p>With left limp he moves</p>
<p>Small inflamed lump below his knee.</p>
<p>A classic sign of Osgood Schlatter’s Disease</p>
<p>Or, perhaps, more a symptom of me?</p>
<p>Statistically not unusual for a twelve–year-old boy</p>
<p>Sporty, talented, in demand, and never still.</p>
<p>With yet another growth spurt in full sway</p>
<p>It’s only to be expected, so they say.</p>
<p>But, I’m left wondering of the part I play,</p>
<p>Is my ex-sporting body silently having its own way?</p>
<p>When might fatherly encouragement and support</p>
<p>Become subtle coercion by memories still to be caught?</p>
<p>There is guilt in my flesh</p>
<p>As his tears of frustration cascade to the ground.</p>
<p>An undirected anger just wanting to let go</p>
<p>Finding release once again in the exhilaration of flow.</p>
<p>Never before has his body said “No”</p>
<p>But now it resists and keeps reminding him so.</p>
<p>Calling for rest and reduced activity</p>
<p>Who knows what this leaves him thinking of me.</p>
<p>We both can but wait for the inflammation to subside</p>
<p>But what will we learn from this unpredictable ride?</p>
<p>Can we find some “ups” between the “downs” and plateaus?</p>
<p>Reshaping our relationship to see where it might go.</p>

<title>Muscular Connections Across the Years</title>
<p>As usual Alexander leaves his <italic>Flex</italic> magazines strewn all over the house. Tidying up the front room I pick up the August 2011 edition. A massive, tanned, ripped, and hypermuscular male bodybuilder called Flex Lewis performing a one-armed cable bicep curl dominates the front page. My eyes are drawn to his bulging bicep pulling the cable. It is pumped up like a football and has a gorged vein running over the top of it that looks like a piece of rope. The comments in bold that surround this body on the rest of the page shout out to the reader: <bold>FILL OUT YOUR CHEST</bold>—NEW SYSTEM FOR INSANE GROWTH; <bold>TRICEPS SHOCKER</bold>: BUILD <bold>THICK</bold> ARMS; <bold>4 weeks to get RIPPED</bold>: Complete training and nutritional plans; <bold>EAT THIS</bold> AND GET SHREDDED; SECRETS TO <bold>RIPPED-UP &amp; DEEP-CUT</bold> ABS. These phrases and pictures of hypermuscular men have hailed Alexander, and he has responded by going to the gym five times a week for the last year. Aged sixteen, at six-foot two (1.88 meters) he now weighs in at 15 stone 9 lbs (100K).</p>
<p>It is not just the images of muscle that have hailed Alexander, it is also the feel of the muscles being pumped, flushed, and gorged when training with weights. There is a sensuality to this experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077800411429095">5</xref></sup> I know because, I felt it myself when I first began training with weights when I was a college student, and I still sometimes experience it now when I train at the same gym that Alexander goes to with his friends. Our motivations, for sure, are different. They go to gain muscular mass while I go to try and stay “in shape,” lose some weight and my noticeable “beer belly.” In this gym, despite the forty years difference in our ages and motivations, we are connected by muscle, by sinews, by fibres of flesh that are coaxed and forced into action by the demands of loose iron weights and resistance machines.</p>
<p>Minus the resistance machines, which were not available back then, such muscular connections are also made with my Dad. He has often told me how, when he was a teenager during the 1940s, he saw the classic Charles Atlas advert in newspapers that promoted his muscular development system for men. The title to the advert pronounced, “How Joe’s body brought him <bold>FAME</bold> instead of <bold>SHAME.</bold>”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077800411429095">6</xref></sup> A series of cartoon pictures then tell the story of Joe that begins with him on the beach with a girlfriend. A muscular man runs by and kicks sand in Joe’s face. An altercation follows in which Joe is embarrassed in front of his girlfriend and called skinny by his tormentor. Joe vows to get even and decides to buy the Charles Atlas Dynamic Tension Program. This leads to Joe admiring his now large muscular body doing a double bicep pose in front of the mirror prior to returning to the beach with his girlfriend and his new physique for display. His tormentor is paid back in public with a punch in the face. The final scene is Joe’s girlfriend holding his arm and gazing into his eyes while saying, “Oh Joe. You ARE a real man after all.” Behind them in place of the setting sun is a caption in bold that says, “<bold>HERO</bold> of the <bold>BEACH</bold>.” Under the final picture in which Joe “wins” the girl is the central claim made by Charles Atlas that “<bold>I can Make YOU A New Man Too In Only 15 Minutes A Day!</bold>”</p>
<p>Like Alexander, my Dad was hailed by this advert and responded. In the absence of loose weights or a gym he used the Charles Atlas Dynamic Tension System to work on his body and try and increase its size. I remember him teaching me some of the exercises when I was a boy. For one, I held my arms out in front of me with the palms facing inwards and together before pressing palm to palm as hard as I could for 30 seconds to contract my chest muscles. I recall the pleasurable feel of the tension in the muscles and the sense of them working to my command. When I was a teenager I bought a contraption known as a <italic>Bullworker</italic>, an isometric exercise device used for strength training that came on to the market in the 1960s. I left it at home when I went to college, and my Dad adopted it for his use. He still has it today, aged eighty six, kept in his bedroom wardrobe, and it is regularly called into service.</p>
<p>Today, I am in the gym doing a “chest and triceps” session. By chance, so is Alexander. He is with his friends in the loose weights area. This is the territory in which serious muscular gains are made and which I used to inhabit frequently in my youth. Now I spend more of my time on the resistance machines, which are less hazardous for my body. From my vantage point as I strain away on the bench-press machine, I can see Alexander laughing with his friends in between sets. There is a sense of camaraderie between them as they help each other with the weights and support each other as they do their exercises.</p>
<p>At one point, as I am doing my sets of cable-crossover pulls for my chest, Alexander separates from his friends and walks over. He nods at me, smiles, and then watches me perform the exercise. Under his gaze, I focus on correct technique and getting a full stretch of the pectorals. When I finish, he smiles again and asks whether he can work in with me between my sets. I am delighted for him to do so. For me, exercising with him is a precious moment. I watch him put the pin into the machine to lift a heavier weight than I did. I watch him pull the cables across his chest. On the eighth repetition he is straining. Without asking, I move in and gently press his hands together towards the end of the next two forced reps so that he can complete his set of ten. Likewise, when we switch so that I can do my next set, he moves in and helps me with some forced reps when I fatigue. I feel his palms press on the back of my hand as simultaneously my pectorals contract with maximal force. Nothing is said; there is no need. We feel the need for support or release in the flesh of each other and react accordingly with care and attention. This is how it is when you operate with a trusted training partner in a gym. Today, I am honored that, just for a while, the training partner is my son. I know that if he had been in the same position with me my Dad would have felt the same. In those feelings, three generations of men, fathers and sons, are connected by muscular strands that weave them together over time in mysterious ways.</p>

<title>August 12, 2011</title>
<p>Alexander is seventeen years of age today. We go to collect his new cricket bat from a local bat maker who makes them to order and has lovingly crafted one for Alexander to meet his personal specifications. His cricket team are top of the league and he has been one of their star players throughout the summer. Alongside this, Alexander has started training with a rugby team he intends to play for in the coming season. He reminds me that some new boots are needed as his old football boots are not up to the task any more.</p>
<p>So soon the cricket season will end and Alexander will be playing rugby. He is relishing this happening. I remain as unsure as ever about his involvement in this sport. All of which will become part of the bits and pieces by which I remember him and he remembers me. Some of these memories will be good and some will be bad. Some will start good and end up bad and vice versa. Memories are tricksters and shape shifters. That’s how bits and pieces work.</p>
