<p>Whenever I begin reading a book that I might review, I always have three questions uppermost in my mind. What can this book add to the knowledge base in the field? Will it be useful for learners in the leadership and organizational classes I teach? Does it foster critical thinking?</p>
<p>The authors are noted for their research on teamwork. Frank LaFasto, PhD worked for 30 years at Cardinal Health, Inc., a multinational health care company. He retired as Senior Vice President of Organization Effectiveness. Carl Larson is a Professor Emeritus at the University of Denver where he worked in the area of Human Communication Studies. The intended audience for this book is college students and those who might be interested in developing a life that is both personally fulfilling and socially responsible. The purpose of the book is to describe how others made choices that enabled them to contribute to society in a meaningful way. The hope of the authors is that by reading the book someone might be in a better position to move quickly from the desire to help others to meaningful action, or in other words, become a humanitarian leader. The authors achieve what they set out to do. The book is short at 152 pages. It is well written and accessible to students and business people. It presents practical ideas that those who aspire to make a difference as leaders can use.</p>
<p>In the Introduction, the authors define this leadership type as ‘those who take charge of helping people in need. They are empathetic leaders who summon the personal initiative, energy, and effort necessary to improve the lives of others’ (p. 4). This book is the result of a qualitative study of 31 participants who fit the definition of humanitarian leader. The primary research questions were: ‘In the context of society, why do some people assume ownership for those in need? Why are they willing to lead by personally doing, as well as by asking others to be involved?’ (p. 4). Grounded theory was used to analyse the data. However, I find it interesting to say the least that, as the authors point out in the Epilogue, no outliers emerged in the data that strayed from the seven choice points that they found. I might have found the evidence more compelling if at least one of the participants in this supposedly diverse group at least skipped a choice point. I will talk more about the demographic makeup of the sample later.</p>
<p>This book consists of three parts and discusses seven choice points the authors discovered are important to the functioning of a humanitarian leader. Each chapter ends with reflection questions to help readers draw similarities between the participant stories and themselves, as well as questions that focused on specific leadership characteristics, such as adaptability.</p>
<p>Part One is about the broader theme of making connections related to the first two choice points. ‘Leveraging Life’s Experiences’ (Chapter 1) illustrates that humanitarian leaders develop an empathic connection between their own life experiences, usually rooted in childhood, and another person who is facing her/his own challenges. Self-awareness and role models was the key to helping them understand and appreciate the connection. The second choice point (Chapter 2) is ‘A Sense of Fairness’. The participants perceived a particular injustice and coupled with their emphatic connection felt a strong motivation to correct the injustice. The participants in this study had two leading principles regarding fairness: both good and bad fortunes exist in the world and equal access to opportunity is imperative to fairness.</p>
<p>The theme of Part Two is about making a commitment. The two choice points discussed are ‘Believe We Can Matter’ (Chapter 3) and ‘Open to an Opportunity’ (Chapter 4). Humanitarian leaders believe they can matter because they focus on three interlocking perspectives about the situation and people they are trying to help. The first perspective involves putting their attention on the person rather than the bigger problem. Second, they understand themselves and are able to match their talents and passions to the right context. Third, the participants saw clearly the difference between a future where they did not step in to help and one where they did. They worked to bring into reality a future where they helped make a difference to those in need. Chapter 4 discusses how the participants were open to opportunities outside of their personal and professional realms where they could help solve a problem. They were consummate problem solvers.</p>
<p>Part Three focuses on making a difference. The first three chapters in this section illustrate the last three choice points. ‘Taking the First Small Step’ (Chapter 5) is the next choice point. The emphasis is on taking a manageable step. According to the authors, the participants did not focus on the larger picture; they focused on what they could do in the immediate future. Their leadership emerged in crossing a threshold and acting. There were no grand visions of changing the world, just a decision to change a life right now. ‘Perseverance’ (Chapter 6) represents how the participants were ready to do whatever it takes to make a difference. They accepted frustration as part of the work of helping people in need and learned to manage the frustration in a productive manner. They were also flexible and open to ways of working with and around the inherent difficulties. Finally, they maintained optimism in the midst of the vicissitudes of trying to make a difference. The last choice point ‘Leading the Way’ (Chapter 7) directly addressed the topic of leading. The participants not only took individual action to help marginalized individuals, they also worked to create an environment that invited others to join them in achieving their goals. They created a shared vision and empowered others.</p>
<p>The last three chapters of this book and section are designed to motivate someone to move from an idea to help someone else to action. They are all very short chapters, each only about five pages in length. They focus on arguing that even a small positive push back against the negative forces in society makes a difference (Chapter 8). They share the findings from the participants about their views of the inherent worthiness of the paths taken (Chapter 9) and provide advice for those who also feel a responsibility to those in need (Chapter 10). This includes suggestions on how to get started and resources.</p>
<p>The compelling narratives from the participants substantiate each choice point. I would think that most college students would find this to be an enjoyable read. There is no jargon and the discussion of any theories is kept to a minimum in the notes at the end of the book.</p>
<p>These notes and the discussion in the text reinforced my perception that a humanitarian leader was a ‘leader’. Therefore, the participants could also be classified under any number of leadership models and characteristics that are part of a substantial wealth of research and literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507612454373">Northouse, 2010</xref>). Moreover, the choice points are found in many leadership models such as servant leadership, authentic leadership, and contingency theory to name a few. The difference was that a humanitarian leader’s primary focus was on helping those marginalized by society, while, for instance, a servant leader’s primary focus is on attending to the needs of their followers through empathy and nurturing them to accomplish their vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507612454373">Greenleaf, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>My critique of this book centers on two things: the demographic makeup of the participants and the lack of any critical reflectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350507612454373">Cunliffe, 2009</xref>) about this leadership style in the larger context of society. The participants in this study were predominately White, accounting for 26 of the 31 participants. There was almost an equal distribution between genders but from the short descriptions about their backgrounds, I would say that most participants were middle/upper class. While the authors provided a list of the interview questions, a demographic chart would have been useful. I find this demographic makeup of participants problematic for two reasons. First, the students at the urban university where I teach and most of the world’s population come from different backgrounds than those of the participants. Of the students at the university where I teach 25% grew up in and still live in poverty and only 60% of the students are White. Very few participants could truly serve as role models for the students.</p>
<p>My second concern is that the participants are for the most part well educated and well connected. While these are not the only or primary characteristics needed to help those who are marginalized, they play a major part in terms of successful impact. In addition, the stakeholders at the table are the ones defining the problem and determining the solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507612454373">Cervero and Wilson, 2006</xref>). In the narratives, it appears that the power is in the hands of predominately White Westerners with no apparent awareness that people can solve their own problems. They may need our resources but not our solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507612454373">Freire, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>I am also concerned that the authors assume that individuals have tremendous power without a consideration of the societal norms causing the problems of the marginalized. None of the discussion in the text or the reflection questions relate to the use of a critical reflectivity stance about an institutional/societal framework that might be the driving force creating the conditions that need redressing. For instance, Chapter 2 focuses on the choice point of fairness and the reflection questions look at fairness from the individual point of view. From a more critical perspective, I might have posed the following questions: In what ways do you think that individuals in our society are privileged or given special access to opportunities? Is this because they earned them, deserved them, or are they based on societal norms? What does it mean to have access because of these reasons? How should society give access to its citizens? Who should decide? Why? Does anything need to change?</p>
<p>In summary, this was a very interesting book to review for <italic>Management Learning</italic>. It does not fit the mold of the usual books that this journal reviews. This leadership style appears to be more of a recombination of older theories. The main characteristics of leadership are similar; the context is different. The reader who is interested in a more scholarly treatment of a leadership style and a contribution to the field will be disappointed. Because it is so uncritical of the systems of power in society, I would not use it in my classroom without a counterweight of a critical management studies text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507612454373">Knights and Willmott, 2007</xref>). I would recommend this book to young adults and those searching for meaning in their lives and looking for inspiration. Perhaps, however, in this time of economic upheaval, a book that inspires people to use their skills, whether paid or not, in the service of humankind is a very useful book.</p>
