<abstract>
<p>This article compares traditional and new ways of funding documentary film in the UK and asks what crowd financing, pay-if-you-want schemes and online distribution sites mean for documentary films and its industry today. How do online financing models impact on producers, traditional funding models and funders? And following the money, who really benefits? The first section of this article charts trends in British documentary budgets in the last decade and explores how changes in financing impact on the production of documentary films. The second focuses on new ways of funding and distributing documentary films online. Drawing on case studies of crowd investment schemes, crowdfunding and P2P distribution; interviews with documentary and multiplatform producers and commissioners, as well as on statistics and annual reports from broadcasters, lobbyists and regulators, I will argue that in real terms there has been a decline in and a polarization of documentary budgets in the UK. As a result, producers are increasingly looking to the internet to fund their documentaries. However, an online financing market suspended between ad hoc funding and long-term recuperation has consequences for the documentary industry, the kinds of documentaries made, the topics they explore and the ways in which they are produced.</p>

<p>In September 2011, Nick Broomfield’s <italic>Sarah Palin: You Betcha!</italic> raised $30,000 for distribution through the crowdfunding site <italic>Kickstarter</italic>. In 2009, the world’s most successful crowd investment effort landed Franny Armstrong £900,000 for her drama-doc <italic>The Age of Stupid</italic> and Jamie King’s <italic>Steal This Film II</italic> financed itself retrospectively through its bit-torrent powered pay-if-you-want scheme. Online documentary financing and distribution are no longer niche activities for newbie producers. At a time of global recession, reductions in TV advertising revenue and polarization of British broadcasters’ documentary budgets, established UK documentary filmmakers are increasingly looking to the internet for alternative ways to supplement documentary budgets, fund and distribute their films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0163443712449499">Sørensen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This article will explore some of the ways in which documentary films, and especially the single documentary, have been financed in the UK in the last decade. Specifically, it will focus on how new ways of funding documentaries online are impacting on the documentary industry as a whole, as well as on individual films.</p>
<p>Although online financing models for documentary are in their infancy, the success of some of these suggests that the internet could become a financially viable alternative means of funding certain kinds of documentary films. Funding and distribution forms on the internet are establishing themselves alongside the funding and distribution models of the ‘traditional’ networked TV broadcaster. However, online funding and distribution break with the ways in which documentaries have been and, to a great extent, still are funded in the UK. Today, the vast majority of documentary films produced in Britain are commissioned and fully funded by one of the four terrestrial broadcasters: BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Five and their subsidiary channels (BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, ITV2, More4, E4, Fiver, Five US). The TV broadcaster which commissions a particular documentary film has the right to show it twice on its channel. After two transmissions, the rights to the film revert to its producer or production company.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0163443712449499">1</xref></sup> So, a documentary on Channel 4 will typically have been fully funded by Channel 4, one on the BBC by the BBC, and so on. This British funding model is different from that in the US, for example, where deficit-financing is the norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712449499">Doyle, 2002</xref>: 82–3). The UK system also differs from other European and North American countries where documentaries are often co-produced and co-financed by various funders in different countries, or where national film boards and councils act as a co-producer, investing up to 50% of the cost of the production, as is the case in, for example, Denmark, Norway and Canada.</p>
<p>Although broadcaster-backed fully funded commissions still account for the majority of documentary financing in the UK today, this is in decline. Commissions by one of the four networked broadcasters fell from 90% in 2004 to 79% in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712449499">PACT, 2009</xref>: 14).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0163443712449499">2</xref></sup> But, while two models for funding and distributing documentary films – online and through the TV networks – should, on the face of it, benefit both filmmakers and broadcasters, in reality both systems are propelling a drive towards a polarization of budgets for documentary films. This has consequences for the industry as a whole as well as for the ways documentaries are made, distributed and seen.</p>
<sec id="section1-0163443712449499" sec-type="methods">
<title>Structure and method</title>
<p>This article consists of two intertwined parts which both explore aspects of the financing and distribution of documentary films in the UK today. First, in order to explain why it has become attractive for documentary producers – independent filmmakers as well as superindies – to seek funding from other sources than the broadcasters, I will start with a short history of trends in documentary funding in Britain in the last decade. I will argue that, as well as obviously influencing individual budgets directly, declining budgets and new funding and distribution forms online have also impacted on the broadcasters’ commissioning and funding priorities for documentary films. This has had consequences for the types of documentary films that are being produced in the UK today and the topics they explore.</p>
<p>The second part will focus on specific cases of crowd investment, crowdfunding and P2P distribution schemes, and explore how documentary makers like Nick Broomfield, Franny Armstrong and Jamie King are funding and distributing documentaries online. I will compare these online distribution and funding forms to the models of the traditional TV broadcasters which, as already stated, dominate the UK documentary film market, and ask how these new online possibilities are impacting on the documentary industry as a whole: the role of the producer, the actual production process of documentary films and the TV channels’ commissioning process and priorities.</p>
<p>The first section draws mainly on annual reports and statistics from TV stations, government, regulators such as Ofcom (the Office of Communication, the ombudsman for the British telecommunications and broadcasting industries) and PACT (the Producers’ Alliance for Cinema and Television, which is the British TV industry’s trade organization), as well as information from the trade press and the British TV channels’ commissioning briefs for the industry. The second section is based on analyses of specific cases of crowd-financing and online distribution. Both sections are cross-referenced with and corroborated by 14 interviews with key documentary and multiplatform commissioning executives from online and networked TV stations (the BBC, Channel 4 and current.tv), the director of PACT as well as independent documentary producers from boutique production companies and superindies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0163443712449499">
<title>Theories and practices</title>
<p>Documentary film funding online is a relatively new phenomenon and so, too, is research into this field. Whereas mobilizing and generating audiences through crowdsourcing and organizing campaigns around documentary screenings and causes have been explored by, for example, Christian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163443712449499">Christiansen (2009)</xref> and Ib <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163443712449499">Bondebjerg (2010)</xref>, the financial equivalents, crowdfunding and other forms of financing and distributing documentary on the internet, have so far received little critical attention.</p>
<p>Economics rarely receives the attention it could and perhaps should in media studies, as Gillian Doyle notes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712449499">2002</xref>: 1). However, this is changing. For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712449499">John T. Caldwell (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163443712449499">2008</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0163443712449499">Jonathan Gray (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712449499">Gillian Doyle (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163443712449499">2011</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163443712449499">Wilma de Jong (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163443712449499">Zvezdan Vukanovic (2009)</xref> have researched the strategic and economic implications of convergence and multiplatform programming from the perspective of media organizations and institutions in the US and the UK. Although Doyle’s <italic>Understanding Media Economics</italic> predates Web 2.0, it anticipates most of the developments and implications for media production. Indeed, Doyle returns to the economics of multiplatform and 360 programming in ‘From television to multiplatform: less from more or more for less?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163443712449499">2011</xref>). Here, she concludes that, for broadcasters, the cost of online content at this point in time outweighs its value. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163443712449499">Vukanovic (2009)</xref> explores the impact of economics on the scope for economic performance of the five largest media companies in the US. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712449499">Caldwell (2006)</xref> debunks the primacy of texts in a multiplatform world and economy and in <italic>Show Sold Separately</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0163443712449499">Gray (2010)</xref> applies a similar argument to specific case studies and calls for further research into the paratexts that surround media texts and what he calls ‘off-screen studies’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163443712449499">Henry Jenkins’ (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712449499">Yochai Benkler’s (2006)</xref> theories about the implications of interaction, user participation and convergence for media industries and their brands have provided inspiration for thinking about both the social aspects and macroeconomic implications of Web 2.0. Applying economic theory to the analysis of crowdfunded projects between 2006 an 2010, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163443712449499">Chris Ward and Vandana Ramachandran (2010)</xref> demonstrate that peer effects and recommendations, not network externalities, are driving the success of crowdfunded projects. Similarly, applying economic theories of entrepreneurial funding, menu pricing, free riding and the consumption of discrete goods to crowdfunding, Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163443712449499">Belleflamme et al. (2011)</xref> conclude that investors in crowdfunded projects generally contribute more than investors normally would, and that crowdfunded projects therefore have a unique selling point that creates this extra, surplus value. Thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163443712449499">Belleflamme et al. (2011)</xref> state that social, entrepreneurial and artistic projects are more likely to crowdfund successfully. However, none of these explore their economic theories about crowdfunding in relation to documentary films. Finally, although Wilma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163443712449499">de Jong’s (2008)</xref> research into the funding of feature documentary film clearly demonstrates the fertility of this approach, media economics is rarely approached from a microeconomic perspective or applied to individual productions.</p>
<p>This article builds on the work of these critics, and their various perspectives and fields of research feed into it. In order to explore how economic trends impact on the actions, activities and behaviour of documentary producers and directors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0163443712449499">3</xref></sup> in an online context, however, this article focuses on both macroeconomic analysis of financing trends in the documentary industry as well as paying particular attention to the microeconomics of specific cases and professional documentary production practices.</p>
<sec id="section3-0163443712449499">
<title>Benkler and Bourdieu</title>
<p>In <italic>The Wealth of Networks</italic> Benkler describes the dynamics of the emerging networked information economy as one in which:
<disp-quote>
<p>decentralized individual action – specifically, new and important cooperative and coordinate action carried out through radically distributed, nonmarket mechanisms that do not depend on proprietary strategies – plays a much greater role than it did, or could have, in the industrial information economy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712449499">2006</xref>: 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This, he argues, changes the context and premises for our understanding of the (media) economy. Benkler is focused on the democratic and participatory potential for individual as well as peer-to-peer and community production, and he envisages an economy in which ‘social production and exchange to play a much larger role, alongside property and market-based production, than they ever have in modern democracies’. He writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>On the background of these limitations of the mass media, I suggest that the networked public sphere enables many more individuals to communicate their observations and their viewpoints to many others, and to do so in a way that cannot be controlled by media owners and is not as easily corruptible by money as were the mass media.… The various formats of the networked public sphere provide anyone with an outlet to speak, to inquire, to investigate, without need to access the resources of a major media organization. We are seeing the emergence of new, decentralized approaches to fulfilling the watchdog function and to engaging in political debate and organization. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712449499">2006</xref>: 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Crowdfunding, peer-to-peer distribution and other online financing and distribution forms are examples of such approaches and alternatives. But, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712449499">Benkler (2006</xref>: 23) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163443712449499">Jenkins (2006)</xref> observe, the old media organizations and institutions are not going to relinquish their oligopoly on documentary and accept this redistribution of power without a fight. However, on closer examination of these new financing forms, it is not just the ‘old’ and traditional media institutions and organizations which resist change – the cultural capital of producers and users also contributes to the maintenance of old hegemonies and hierarchies of taste. Adding Pierre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712449499">Bourdieu’s (1984)</xref> notion of distinction to the equation, the gatekeeping function of the broadcasters is not only embedded in the physical institutional structures, workflows, consciousness and self-understanding of these organizations themselves, it is also very much alive in the minds of the producers and users of the films and media production. The gatekeeping function of broadcasters, festivals and cinemas is as much an embedded institutional and organizational trait, as it serves as a mark of cultural distinction in the field of documentary film production and viewing. To put it bluntly, at this particular point in time, it is cooler to have one’s film on the BBC than on YouTube. And it is a mark of greater cultural capital to watch a documentary at a film festival in the cinema than from one’s sofa. As I hope to show in the following pages, name recognition, branding and access to esteemed distribution outlets, channels and festivals still determine what is produced, funded and commissioned – and this is as much the case inside the traditional production and distribution systems as it is in the new financing and distribution forums online.</p>

<title>Documentary budgets in decline?</title>
<p>Historically, documentary film budgets have always been under pressure. For example, Goddard et al.’s <italic>Public Issue Television</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163443712449499">2007</xref>) chronicles the ever-present threat of cuts affecting both the content and editorial integrity of current affairs programmes in the UK. However, in recent years, programme budgets have declined in real terms and this has particularly affected documentary and factual programmes.</p>
<p>In the past decade, advertising revenue for commercial broadcast channels has fallen in the UK. This decline has particularly affected the three commercially funded public service broadcasters (Channel 4, Five and ITV), who saw their total advertising share fall by 16% between 2002 and 2006. In 2007, online advertising spend overtook TV advertising for the first time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712449499">Ofcom, 2008</xref>) and, as TV advertising revenue continued to decline, programme budgets were reduced in 2007 and 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0163443712449499">PACT, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712449499">2009</xref>). The TV industry was – along with most other industries – hit by the 2008 global recession which (at the time of writing) continues to cause economic instability. The recession not only affects consumer confidence and spending power, but has also driven further reductions in spending on advertising, because, as Doyle points out, advertising activity is strongly associated with the performance of economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712449499">2002</xref>: 3, 47–51). This is corroborated by the PACT census of 2009 which lists a 4% reduction in primary programme prices due to the global recession of 2008–9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712449499">PACT, 2009</xref>: 38). In May 2009, Channel 4 and ITV announced cuts to their editorial budgets of £75m and £20m respectively.</p>
<p>This decline in programme budgets has hit documentary films and factual programming hardest. According to PACT’s 2009 census of the independent TV industry: ‘The proportion of spend on Factual programming appears to have suffered the greatest decline in 2008, falling from 15% of spend in the 2007 census to an estimated 9% in 2008’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712449499">2009</xref>: 13). Similarly, Ofcom’s 2011 annual PBS broadcasting report recorded a 17% decrease in spending in real terms on first-run factual and documentary programmes between 2006 and 2010. In this period, budgets for the factual subgenres Arts/Classical Music, Religion/Ethics and Education fell by 30%, 34% and 23% respectively to £46m, £13m and £19m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0163443712449499">Ofcom, 2011</xref>). It is worth noting that the number of hours of other types of documentary and factual programming produced by the British PBS channels increased by 24% in this same period. Although advertising revenue stabilized in 2010 and the ban on product placement in TV programmes in the UK was lifted by Ofcom on 28 February 2011, product placement is still prohibited in documentaries and current affairs programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0163443712449499">4</xref></sup> Documentary budgets have remained depressed.</p>
<p>Ofcom’s breakdown of PSB overall content and first-run originated spend, by genre is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0163443712449499">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0163443712449499">Ofcom, 2011</xref>). The decline in budgets has coincided with other significant changes in the television industry and documentary production sector. On the production level, the rise of digital technologies and equipment has led to a general fall in the cost of production equipment, cameras, sound recording equipment, editing and postproduction software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163443712449499">Chapman and Allison, 2009</xref>: 21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712449499">Doyle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0163443712449499">Ofcom, 2011</xref>: 8). The effect of this has been twofold. Firstly, it has reduced the cost of equipment and facilities hire and purchase, and secondly it has enabled one person to fulfil the roles of many crew members, effectively reducing the need for large crews on shoots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712449499">Doyle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163443712449499">Gaunt, 2009</xref>). Both factors have significantly reduced the cost of the production of documentaries which has in turn been used to justify lower budgets for documentary films.</p>

</fig>
<p>On the distribution and broadcasting level, documentary and factual budgets have been hit harder than other genres for at least two further reasons. First, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712449499">Corner (1995)</xref> and others have pointed out, on a distribution level documentary has very much been seen as anchored in the TV schedule and, because the broadcasters have traditionally owned the rights to TV programmes and brands, producers have been unaccustomed to exploiting secondary markets, or reluctant to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712449499">Doyle, 2002</xref>: 83). However, this has changed in recent years, a point to which I shall return. Second, except in very rare cases, documentary films have not attracted the mass television audiences of other genres, like drama or entertainment. Director of PACT John McVay, linking the decline in budgets to documentary as a genre, explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>The recession has a major impact on a number of genres. One, all broadcasters have changed the mix of their schedules to go for lower-cost, longer-run entertainment formats…. And the service they are really coming down on is areas like documentary because they don’t make any money back. (Interview with author, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although documentary is often cheaper to produce than drama, its opportunity cost in terms of lost advertising revenue, is far higher. Consequently, for a commercial broadcaster, documentaries are expensive to air. McVay continues:
<disp-quote>
<p>And all commercial broadcasters are either required, in terms of the regulation, to show us certain types of programmes, or make money. So, a documentary at seven o’clock on a Thursday night may not cost very much to make, maybe £80,000, but the actual advertising lost in that particular slot can be £200,000. The opportunity cost, i.e. the cost to show that programme is not £80,000, but this cost plus the cost of lost advertising…. So genres which don’t perform in the commercial schedule, they are not getting dumped because of the cost of the production [but] because of the opportunity cost. (Interview with author, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Or, as Tom Loosemore, the then Head of Channel 4’s new media fund 4IP, bluntly put it at Sheffield Documentary Festival 2009: ‘Docs don’t rate in terms of advertisers.’ Channel 4 has a public service remit to commission and show documentaries as does the BBC, but on the commercial channels, with no remit or obligation to show documentaries, there has been a marked reduction in numbers produced. ITV has all but stopped commissioning documentaries and the decline in budgets has hit the floor on the commercial broadcaster Five. Chris Shaw, Five’s then commissioning editor for documentaries, said at the same event: ‘We do have slots with zero budget attached to them. How do you get a programme for that? You get someone else to pay for them.’ Although there is the commitment and space in the schedule to show documentaries on Five, there is no money. Consequently documentary content on Five needs sponsorship. These reductions in documentary budgets do not only apply to the commercial broadcasters. In an interview in <italic>Broadcast</italic>, Nick Fraser of BBC’s <italic>Storyville</italic> warned:
<disp-quote>
<p>Documentary-makers were very worried about being overcome by <italic>Big Brother</italic> and ‘Big Mac’ docs, but I think that phase has passed and the worry is now much more basic. These people are working for nothing. We’re talking such small amounts of money, it’s getting alarming. (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0163443712449499">Rushton, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Chris Shaw and Nick Fraser’s statements indicate, the erosion in budgets has precipitated trends in documentary making that were already there. First, sponsorship of programmes is increasingly commonplace on the commercially funded PBS broadcasters, which have websites devoted to information for potential sponsors. This is also the case for factual and documentary programming. Honda sponsors Channel 4’s documentaries and its food programmes are sponsored by Tropicana and Alpro. Continental Tyres backed the travelogue <italic>Paul Merton’s India</italic> on Five. Sponsorship obviously restricts the range of subjects that can be explored, as sponsors decide in what subject matter they want to invest. In addition, it is difficult to safeguard credibility and notions of impartiality and balance when a documentary is funded by political parties, NGOs, charities, or is sponsored by a business. As Nick Fraser has observed: ‘If Dr Goebbels appeared with a huge sack of money, there would be documentary filmmakers queuing around the block to take it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163443712449499">Cox, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0163443712449499">Rushton, 2009</xref>)</p>
<p>Second, the rise in first-person documentaries described, among others, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163443712449499">Jerslev (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163443712449499">Dovey (2000)</xref>, has been cemented and commercialized by documentaries fronted by celebrities or well-known reporters. Here the fame factor adds to the personal journey in an attempt to use name-recognition to draw in viewers. Third, single docs still do exist, but there is little room for them in the TV schedules and few commissioning editors to whom producers can pitch such ideas and proposals, as the schedules are increasingly filled with documentary series, strands, themed nights and seasons designed to retain and ensure the return of viewers.</p>
<p>However, there are exceptions to the reductions in budgets. Simon Dickson, the then commissioning editor for Channel 4 documentaries, explained at the ‘PBS in an Online Environment’ panel at Sheffield Documentary Festival 2009:
<disp-quote>
<p>Investment in documentaries is as much as can be afforded…. A lot is said about budgets being cut, but for the right idea there is more money than there ever was. We’re working very hard to pay a little less for the stuff we used to pay top dollar for, and more for the documentaries we believe will make big impact, like <italic>The Family</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, there is a polarization of budgets. At one end of the spectrum, there is the no- to low-budget documentary, while at the other there are the big-budget high-profile documentary series or those that command feature-film size budgets. Documentary films which have commanded big budgets include the multi-rig documentary, like Channel 4’s serialized remakes (2009, 2010, 2011) of Paul Watson and Franc Roddam’s seminal observational documentary series <italic>The Family</italic> (first shown on BBC in 1974); the interactive documentary series <italic>Seven Days</italic> (Channel 4, 2010) which was advertised as the next generation <italic>Big Brother</italic>; feature documentaries for cinematic release such as <italic>Touching the Void</italic> (dir. Kevin MacDonald, 2003) or <italic>Man on Wire</italic> (dir. James Marsh, 2008); or blue-chip nature or history documentaries, like the BBC’s <italic>Blue Planet</italic> (2003–11) or <italic>Life</italic> (2009), which are used as channel profiling and aimed at the box-set market.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that durable budgets still exist for some documentaries, for example in the PBS broadcasters’ dedicated documentary strands. But while the annual number of hours for documentaries on strands like Channel 4’s <italic>Cutting Edge, Unreported World</italic> and <italic>Dispatches</italic> and the BBC’s <italic>Panorama</italic> fluctuate, the average budget for documentary films in these strands has remained stable, and has thus declined in real terms. Moreover, across documentary output as a whole, as the above quotations and figures indicate, there has been a decline in budgets that do not fall into the big budget category. Increasingly, there is a polarization of documentary financing in the UK documentary market that is suspended between no/low and big budgets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0163443712449499">
<title>Crowdsourcing and outsourcing</title>
<p>It is in this economic climate that the ‘no- to low-budget’ documentaries are moving online and documentary film producers are seeking to finance or secure additional funding for their films on the internet. This takes two forms. Documentary makers can either try to recoup investments already made by various forms of distribution online, or secure funding for their films prior to (or during) production. Obviously recoupment or upfront financing models are not mutually exclusive and many funding models combine both approaches.</p>
<sec id="section6-0163443712449499">
<title>Distribution</title>
<p>In the last decade there has been a revival of interest in documentary films attested to by the proliferation of documentary film festivals across the world, as well as the box office successes of feature documentaries such as <italic>An Inconvenient Truth</italic> (dir. Davis Guggenheim, 2006), <italic>Touching the Void</italic> (dir. Kevin MacDonald, 2003), <italic>Super Size Me</italic> (dir. Morgan Spurlock, 2004) and the films of Michael Moore. This has both created and proved the viability of a secondary market for documentaries. Like cinemas and festivals, the internet is a perfect venue for accessing and viewing documentary films and this has fuelled a plethora of new documentary film portals, streaming and downloads sites, such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://joiningthedocs.com">joiningthedocs.com</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Vodo.net">Vodo.net</ext-link> or the documentary sections and catalogues of subscription-based film rental and streaming services like <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lovefilm.com">lovefilm.com</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Netflix.com">Netflix.com</ext-link>. These sites allow documentary films to find new audiences globally and attract niche or special interest viewers.</p>
<p>The online ‘backstage areas’ of documentary festivals like the Sheffield International Documentary Festival allow delegates exclusive access to the back catalogue of the festival’s films after it has ended. This relieves pressure on cinemathèques and cinema seats during the festival itself and gives viewers a wider window in which to watch the officially selected films of the festival. TV stations’ VOD services have also proved successful in generating additional audiences for TV documentaries either vosdal (Viewing-On-Same-Day-As-Live) or in the window after the transmission day for which they are available online. Fewer than 25% of documentary films have primetime slots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0163443712449499">Ofcom, 2011</xref>: 19–35) and the availability, as well as time-shifting afforded by VOD, is significant. According to a survey in <italic>Broadcast</italic> magazine, documentary accounted for 15% of all VOD viewing in the first half of 2011, compared to an average of 7.3% for time-shifted viewing of all genres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0163443712449499">Price, 2011</xref>). Nick Fraser observes that although the documentaries on BBC’s <italic>Storyville</italic> strand rarely have large viewing figures when they are transmitted on BBC 4, they always do well on VOD and often figure in the top five shows viewed on iPlayer (Interview with author, 2010). Both types of VOD allow audiences additional opportunities to see documentary content and thus act as a secondary market for the films.</p>
<p>Although the forms of distribution listed above are ‘new’ online ways of watching and distributing documentary, they rely on old distribution methods, structures and recoupment models. However, there are novel web-based ways of distributing films and recouping investment after their premiere. For example, the distribution site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Vodo.net">Vodo.net</ext-link> relies on P2P promotion on torrent tracker sites with links to either subscription-based access to Vodo.net’s films or to pay-if-you-want funding schemes. Using Vodo.net’s model, Jamie King advertised <italic>Steal This Film II</italic> (2007) on bit-torrent sites with links to the film’s own distribution site and pay-if-you-want scheme. Here, viewers can watch this film and a selection of others and pay what they think appropriate afterwards (the choice is either to pay nothing or a minimum of $5 to cover administration costs and Paypal’s charges). According to King, speaking at a panel on online documentary funding at the Sheffield Documentary Festival 2009, his film has grossed more than £30,000, which corresponds to a regional BBC budget for an independently produced 30-minute documentary. A pay-if-you-want scheme was also used to distribute Bret Gaylor’s <italic>RIP! A Remix Manifesto</italic> (2008), which was funded and made available in this manner by the Canadian Film Board.</p>

<sec id="section7-0163443712449499">
<title>Production funding</title>
<p>Recently, there has been a rise in documentary films that are financed online. Whereas the distribution models above often recoup revenue from content that has already been funded by broadcasters, the producers themselves or other public or private financiers, these documentaries are funded and distributed online and then, in some cases, sold to the broadcasters, thus reversing the traditional funding chain. Accordingly, there has been a buzz around concepts like crowdfunding and crowd investment in the press, on film blogs and at documentary festivals.</p>
<sec id="section8-0163443712449499">
<title>Crowdfunding</title>
<p>Crowdfunding is essentially the micro-financing of individual projects and is catered for online by sites like <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://indiegogo.com">indiegogo.com</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sponsume.com">sponsume.com</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crowdfunder.co.uk">crowdfunder.co.uk</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pledgie.com">pledgie.com</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Kickstarter.com">Kickstarter.com</ext-link>. These sites enable projects to build communities and hone and gather funding pledges from individual sponsors. Crowdfunding sites are not specifically for film projects, but are used by filmmakers to finance production as well as distribution. Each site operates slightly differently, but the principle can be exemplified by Kickstarter, which is the current site of choice for filmmakers. Kickstarter allows producers to advertise their projects by featuring the project’s trailer, pitch and pledge to produce/distribute the film, if they raise set sum, decided at the outset, in one month. Supporters then pledge to donate individual sums. Generally the larger the contribution supporters make, the more privileges they get. For example, a £50 pledge might get a supporter a DVD of the film, a £100 pledge a signed poster and DVD, for £500 an invite to the premiere and an end credit, etc. If the project reaches the full amount of funding, each supporter’s donation is deducted from their accounts through Paypal. If it fails, the pledge is void. Other sites, for example <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://indiegogo.com">indiegogo.com</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sponsume.com">sponsume.com</ext-link>, pay out the amount raised regardless of whether the initial sum set has been reached.</p>

<sec id="section9-0163443712449499">
<title>Crowd investment</title>
<p>In perhaps the world’s most famous example of crowd investment, Franny Armstrong raised £900,000 for the documentary feature <italic>The Age of Stupid</italic>. The film is a critique of today’s climate politics and features Peter Postlethwaite as the sole survivor of a future eco-disaster, looking back at TV footage of the climate issues that faced the world in 2009 and musing that had politicians acted, the world and humanity would have been saved.</p>
<p>The finance for <italic>The Age of Stupid</italic> was raised through selling shares of £500 in the film prior to and during its production in turn for a percentage of the profits of the film annually over ten years. Although the film has yet to make a profit, investors have recouped their initial investment. Armstrong’s shares scheme did not start online, because the project was initially kept secret as Armstrong wanted to film undercover. However, once the filming was under way, the internet hugely facilitated the coordination and organization of the crowd investment effort. Raising private investment for individual films is an established documentary practice described by, for example, Emile de Antonio and Anand Patwardhan in Jane Chapman’s <italic>Documentary in Practice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163443712449499">2007</xref>: 26–8). However, the internet makes this process easier and also affords new ways of involving and interacting with individual sponsors, a point I shall return to.</p>
<p>Franny Armstong also used the internet to distribute <italic>The Age of Stupid.</italic> Half the film’s budget was used for the production of the film and the other half for its promotion and distribution. The film’s premiere, attended by Postlethwaite and the then Climate Minister Ed Miliband, was held in an inflatable eco-sustainable cinema in Leicester Square in the centre of London and generated considerable press coverage. Afterwards, the distribution of the film was done entirely online. On the website of Armstrong’s production company Spanner Films, distributors, exhibitors, interested parties, groups and individuals can buy a licence to screen the film. The film can then be downloaded or streamed live via using Spanner Film’s own software and these screenings can be complemented by live streamed link-ups so that the filmmakers can attend virtual Q&amp;As. In this way much of the exhibition took the form of events, centred around and organized by communities active in the climate debate. Today, the film has been seen by over 40 million people, has aired on TV stations across the world and is now available on DVD, streamed online and through iTunes.</p>

<title>Perspectives on online funding and distribution</title>
<p>Thus, the online distribution model works along the principles of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712449499">Chris Anderson’s (2006)</xref> long-tail economy and online financing models are based on micro-financing and investment in shares. Both can be seen as viable additions to the upfront financing and distribution of the British broadcasters’ commissioning system. However, although online funding systems outside the commissioning process of the broadcasters are often hailed as advantageous to filmmakers, online financing is not unproblematic and there are serious implications for documentary films and their producers, as the following cases will show.</p>
<sec id="section11-0163443712449499">
<title>Editorial control and rights to the film</title>
<p>Online funding allows producers to create films outwith the broadcasters’ commissioning process and the involvement of the broadcasters’ commissioning editors and executives. This gives editorial and creative freedom to the filmmaker. This can be difficult to maintain when a project is fully financed by and contractually tied to a broadcaster, because the broadcaster’s commissioning editor will typically also act as an executive producer and potentially have significant say in the editorial of the film. However, this freedom is hard-earned and puts new pressures on filmmakers. Funding online enables the filmmaker to retain the rights to the film and thus the right and ability to exploit secondary markets. Conversely, although the producer’s rights to the film are insured as part of PACT’s terms of trade, when a film is funded by TV broadcasters and going through their funding models and commissioning systems, it is, in reality, hard for smaller independent filmmakers to implement these terms and retain rights, as both trade press reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0163443712449499">Kanter, 2011</xref>) and documentary filmmakers Marie Olesen and Franny Armstrong attest (interviews with author). However, one of the benefits of a commission from broadcasters is that they also come with departments for promotion and distributing films – roles that the self-financed documentary-maker has to fulfil him- or herself. Armstrong describes her role in the making of <italic>The Age of Stupid</italic> as ‘documentary-maker, PR person, saleswoman, fundraiser, public speaker and distributor’ (interview with author). While a talented documentary maker can make a film, not everyone has the will, clout, skills, time or business sense to promote it.</p>
<p>Although it is possible for the individual producer or production house to retain rights, within the existing audiovisual market in the UK, the effective and dominant distribution channels remain with the established broadcasters, brands and outfits. Their means of delivering content is underpinned by and supports the existing distribution models: on the one hand, the DVD rental and streaming sites, Netflix and LoveFilm (the merging of the DVD rental sites of the <italic>Guardian</italic> newspaper and Amazon) and, on the other, the VOD services and distribution arms of the established TV channels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0163443712449499">
<title>Crowdsourcing as community building and promotion</title>
<p>Although online financing models are much hyped, they are by no means always successful in ensuring production funding or distribution. While online financing forms operate outside the gatekeeping of the broadcasters, the mechanism of gatekeeping is still at play. For crowdsourcing schemes in which supporters have to decide whether to invest, the subject of the film – its cause – plays a part, but so does name recognition.</p>
<p>Franny Armstrong describes <italic>The Age of Stupid</italic> as the world’s most successful crowd investment project and attributes this to three things:
<disp-quote>
<p>We had three factors that were really important for us. One was the subject: climate change. We started in 2004, pre-<italic>Inconvenient Truth</italic>, when it wasn’t so mainstream. So the idea that a film was going to come along and make that jump, a lot of people really wanted to be part of that. Number two was me, because I’d made films like <italic>McLibel</italic> in the past that all these people had seen and had a lot of respect for. [They knew] that it was not going to be a sell-out, that it was going to be rigorous criticism. And the third factor was John Battsek who was our executive producer. He’s won an Oscar and gave it a glamorous edge. So, I think people were thinking: ‘Well, it could be another one of them.’ (Interview with author)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In August 2011, two feature documentaries appeared on Kickstarter. Both projects appealed for $30,000 to distribute and take their films to market, and both were promoted and pushed heavily on social network sites, in the press and through Kickstarter’s updates. Both directors were British and both production teams had made award-winning films for UK TV broadcasters. Both films followed personal journeys to explore contemporary political issues. In <italic>Sarah Palin: You Betcha!</italic>, Nick Broomfield wanted to uncover the homelands of Sarah Palin prior to the start of the 2012 US election campaign. <italic>Minefield – A Film about War, Football and Friendship</italic> followed soccer coach Scotty Lee, who promotes reconciliation through football training with children in Iraq, and examined the allied forces’ involvement in the reconstruction effort and impact on civilians. Only Nick Broomfield’s film reached its target of $30,000. Thus, although both projects had similar experiential surplus value, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163443712449499">Belleflamme et al. (2011)</xref> describe as necessary to attract investors to a crowdfunding project, crowd-financing is not a certain funding avenue for every worthwhile project. It is likely that the fact that Nick Broomfield and Sarah Palin are immediately recognizable names contributed to that film’s funding success, as was the case with <italic>The Age of Stupid</italic>.</p>
<p>It may be useful to view the fact that a film is crowdfunded as being as much a part of the film’s promotion as it is of its funding strategy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163443712449499">Belleflamme et al. (2011)</xref> suggest that crowdfunding should be seen as a broader concept that affords ways to develop and test drive corporate activities around the project and, to follow John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712449499">Caldwell (2006)</xref>, the secondary text, the ‘making of’ or ‘crowdfunding’ story of, for example, <italic>The Age of Stupid</italic>, is as much part of the making sense of, message and mythology surrounding the film as the primary text itself: <italic>The Age of Stupid</italic> is as famous for its financing scheme as it is as a film. Similarly, the Danish director Frank Piasecki Poulsen’s <italic>Blood in the Mobile</italic> attempted to raise the final 10% of its budget through a Facebook-promoted crowd-financing scheme on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pledie.com">pledie.com</ext-link>. During the production of the feature, Poulsen promoted the crowd-financing aspect of his film at panels at various documentary festivals, such as Sunnyside of the Doc and the Sheffield Documentary Festival 2009. With a budget of 3.6m Danish kroner secured from the Danish Film Institute, Danida, MEDIA, DR, WDR, YLE, NRK (Norway), DUNA TV (Hungary), ERT (Greece) and TG4 (Ireland), it seems fair to assume that the crowd-financing aspect had as much to do with the promotion of the film and building a community around the documentary and its cause, as it did with its financing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0163443712449499">
<title>Online financing: a certain kind of documentary</title>
<p>Although online funding is often seen as a way to bolster any production budget, certain types of documentary lend themselves to online financing. First, relying on a community for funding and distribution lends itself to certain subject matter. Supporters are not only financially supporting a film, but also its cause. Thus crowdfunding and crowd investment schemes usually attract campaigning and issue-led films. The financial aspect is not the only benefit of crowd investment and crowdfunding schemes, and building a community plays a huge part both in promotion and the production and distribution processes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0163443712449499">5</xref></sup> Both Armstong and Poulsen used their networks and Facebook to promote their films, post updates on the production process, and advertise screening and events after the release of the films. These are well-established activist filmmaking practices, and Christian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163443712449499">Christiansen (2009)</xref> has documented the importance of building a community around the campaigning and issue-based films of Brave New Films.</p>
<p>Second, the long-tail economics of online distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712449499">Anderson, 2006</xref>) all but precludes films with high start-up costs. Broadcaster backing and the upfront and fully funded commissions that are the norm in the UK are necessary to produce, for example, long-form observational documentary films, drama-documentaries, high-spec nature and history films, undercover investigations and other films that require high-level institutional legal backing.</p>
<p>This not only affects the types of documentaries made, it also potentially creates a situation where editorial attributes traditionally associated with documentary are challenged by their online counterparts. In the UK, journalistic standards of balance, impartiality and objectivity are safeguarded internally by the TV channels’ Producer Guidelines and compliance, to which all productions must contractually and ethically adhere, and externally by the legislation and regulations enforced by Ofcom. Online there are no such guidelines. As a consequence conspiracy theories or documentaries presenting alternative viewpoints, which cannot find a place in the mainstream TV schedules, flourish online, one example being <italic>Loose Change</italic> (Dylan Avery, 2005–9) about the White House’s alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks. In online documentaries it is not always obvious who the producer is or what their agendas are, and the facts presented in these films are impossible to verify or check, and no one can be held accountable for them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0163443712449499">
<title>The broadcasters – outsourcing production and risk</title>
<p>Explaining the relationship between media conglomerates and niche producers, Klaus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0163443712449499">Bruhn Jensen (2008</xref>: 115–16) links convergence to divergence of media use and outsourcing. Online financing forms and the ability to produce documentaries parallel to the broadcasters’ commissioning structures offer new opportunities for documentary producers. It also benefits the broadcasters. While broadcasters relinquish initial editorial control in the production process, they have access to many more, ready-made films, streamed online and shown at festivals, than they could possibly commission themselves. These documentaries have already been produced and thus there are no economic or editorial risks involved in the production process for the broadcasters. The end result is that the broadcasters’ buyers have a huge catalogue of documentaries to choose from – and always at a fraction of the amount it would cost to co-produce or finance the film.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0163443712449499">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cheaper, more accessible technology has lowered the entry barriers for documentary-makers. Today, it is possible for anyone to make and try to promote a film online. However, access does not equal ability, as Franny Armstrong points out:
<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the internet is democratizing in that sense that the cheap equipment is democratizing. But just because a football is cheap and anyone can kick one around, it doesn’t mean that everybody is Ronaldo. And so there’s a lot of crap films too. (Interview with author)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Online documentaries that come to prominence are, as illustrated above, either backed by established media organizations, or promoted in the press, or have the name recognition and marks of distinction that help them rise to the surface.</p>
<p>Existing and traditional institutional parameters and taste hierarchies may not solely decide what is being produced, but they are certainly determining factors in what is promoted, is widely available and thus most widely viewed. TV is still the platform that reaches the most viewers in the UK. Cinema premieres and selection at festivals are still important for the success of a film, not only as mark of acceptance into the cultural taste hierarchies, but also in terms of the promotion and advertising for the film. Institutional recognition as well as a track record and name recognition are thus important factors for the financial and critical success of documentary films. This is also the case for films funded and distributed online. Although crowdfunding and crowd investment ventures and online distribution schemes are often perceived as level playing fields with no or low entry barriers, it is not only the material capital, but very much also the cultural capital that a project is able to accumulate which determines whether a film receives funding in the first place and, subsequently, reaches a significant audience. And, as the crowd investment and funding cases of Armstrong and Broomfield show, name recognition and track record are important factors when crowdfunders decide whether to contribute to a film, just as they are when festivals select films or TV broadcasters decide what documentaries to buy and air.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Online funding models for documentary films are a relatively new phenomenon. But with the success of the distribution of documentary films online and as funding of documentary films becomes more commonplace, the internet could well prove itself to be a(nother) natural home for documentaries, or at least be a platform and funding avenue that exists alongside the documentary film production industry sustained by the broadcasters. This shift in the way films are financed and made in the UK carries with it new complexities for the documentary industry and, especially, for the documentary producers. It also has implications for the types of films made, the subjects they can explore and the way they are produced.</p>
<p>Although online funding methods are establishing themselves as alternatives to traditional financing models, and are certainly hyped as such at festivals and in the press, the gatekeeping mechanisms are still in place, albeit in an institutional as well as a Bourdieusian incarnation. Indeed, it is hard to determine whether aesthetic and editorial preferences have been established institutionally and passed on to the crowd online, or whether the gatekeeping function of the institutions was always a manifestation of taste hierarchies in society. But the self-regulation of ‘crowd commissions’ online seems to suggest that gatekeeping can no longer be seen as a concept confined to an institutional context.</p>
<p>Size, name and brand recognition matter. Broadcasters, superindies and brands that have the clout to use their names to gain competitive advantage by diversifying diagonally and cross-promoting can dominate the market. Although the right to the airwaves is no longer confined to TV broadcasters, it is the conglomerates rather than new entrants that are dominating the audiovisual market online.</p>

<p>The producers’ ability to retain the right to the production is a relative new phenomenon in the UK. It was established in the changes to the terms of trade between independent producers and broadcasters that was negotiated by PACT in 2004. Before 2004, the broadcaster that funded the film would have the rights to the production in all media, all territories and in perpetuity. However, these terms are currently being undermined, an issue I will return to later in this article. PACT is the TV and film producers’ trade organization in the UK.</p>

<p>The data in this census is for all primary commissions and does not provide numbers for commissions by specific genres. However, it is mentioned that drama and entertainment are the genres with the most external funding.

Also, in production processes where the documentary-maker is fulfilling a number of different roles and often, by and large, works by him- or herself, the community can be an inspiration and source of practical help, as well as a financial resource. Franny Armstrong drew both moral and practical support from her community of investors, who provided encouragement and donated, for example, the use of a recording studio and a country cottage during the writing process.</p>
