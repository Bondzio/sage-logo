<abstract>
<p>Previous scholarship pertaining to the social bases of proenvironmental behavior presents an equivocal picture of the influence of social class indicators. In further investigation of this possible association, the author examined municipal-level data in Massachusetts, compiled by various state agencies, exploring whether sociodemographics are associated with recycling rates, hybrid car ownership, and the presence of sustainability advocacy groups. Results indicate that the proportion of college-educated population was significantly associated with recycling and hybrid auto ownership, whereas results for the civic action group presence show population density and political voting were significant but not sociodemographics. The insignificance of economic metrics implies that policy makers and social scientists in this specific case should focus more on cultural factors than financial barriers in encouraging certain behaviors.</p>

<p>Global environmental change—including climate change, resource depletion, and desertification—has made environmental issues more resonant than at any time in recent memory, chiefly due to the scope and potential for deleterious effects on humanity. Taken together, these issues are viewed by many in the social and natural sciences as some of the most pressing problems facing humanity in late modernity—not only because of the scope but also because of the necessarily global character of mitigation efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916511416647">Beck, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916511416647">Hansen, 2007</xref>). Although individual behaviors often seem negligible in the face of the structural forces required for successful mitigation efforts, some researchers see these actions as reflexively linked to even the largest issues as a form of “life politics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916511416647">Giddens, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013916511416647">Shah et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013916511416647">Soron, 2010</xref>). Theorists have often focused on the substantial gaps between environmental attitudes and these individual behaviors, building models that include economic and cultural constraints as influences on the lack of actualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916511416647">Kollmuss &amp; Agyeman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013916511416647">Stern, 2000</xref>). Still, empirical research examining behavior has often found equivocal results related to the influence of social class on a range of such actions, which has led some to dismiss their relevance and emphasize psychosocial or attitudinal variables as more salient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013916511416647">Mobley, Vagias, &amp; DeWard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916511416647">Roberts, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0013916511416647">Stets &amp; Biga, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0013916511416647">Straughan &amp; Roberts, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are reasons to suspect that the consigning social class to irrelevancy is both premature and problematic. First, the vast majority of quantitative survey research is based on self-reported behavioral data, which has advantages in terms of item design and variable specification, yet is subject to issues such as social desirability bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013916511416647">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, &amp; Lee, 2003</xref>). Second, studies employing direct observation methods are often experiments based on small samples from specific research sites (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916511416647">Gamba &amp; Oskamp, 1994</xref>, who examined a suburban city’s recycling behaviors). In light of the gap between the ubiquity of “proenvironmental” attitudes and the often discrepant behavioral trends, I argue that further research analyzing the structural impediments to and influences of environmental action is warranted.</p>
<p>To explore whether socioeconomic and cultural variables are robust predictors of environmental behavior, I gathered municipal-level data for cities and towns in Massachusetts. Massachusetts was chosen because of the availability of the data and because looking at one state provides an opportunity to examine standardized metrics of behavior on a regional scale. For example, the formula for determining recycling rates varies by state, which introduces potential for measurement error in national-level analysis. Environmental behaviors examined in this study are recycling rates, rates of hybrid car ownership, and the presence of a climate or sustainability advocacy group within the given municipality. These three metrics correspond to waste management, consumption, and civic engagement behaviors, respectively, measuring facets of three general areas where municipal action is needed to improve environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916511416647">Di Vita, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916511416647">Grazi &amp; Van Den Bergh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013916511416647">Portney, 2005</xref>). Although municipal data also suffer from weaknesses, such as incomplete data for some variables (e.g., recycling rates, for which only 314 of 351 cities and towns provided data), and an inability to capture individual-level behaviors, they provide a relatively unexploited strategy for studying social behaviors, which relies on more direct methods of measurement than self-reports. For example, rather than asking survey respondents whether they own a hybrid vehicle, these data use hybrid auto registrations compiled by the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. To assess whether socioeconomic and cultural variation in Massachusetts’ municipalities correlates with these three metrics of environmental behavior, I examine whether they are positively associated with social class metrics (both economic and cultural) on a municipal level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013916511416647">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Social Class/Environmental Behavior Nexus</title>
<p>Findings related to the social bases of both environmental attitudes and behaviors (either measured directly or through self-reported data) have been equivocal. Because of the documented gap between them (i.e., environmental concern not translating into meaningful action), further research that explores behavior itself is warranted. Although at one time social class seemed to have positive, albeit modest, correlations with environmental attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0013916511416647">Van Liere &amp; Dunlap, 1980</xref>), recent research suggests that proenvironmental dispositions have diffused throughout every strata of American society, such that demographics are largely useless in predicting concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916511416647">Buttel, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916511416647">Dunlap &amp; McCright, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013916511416647">Samdahl &amp; Robertson, 1989</xref>). These empirical findings are at odds with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916511416647">Inglehart’s (1981)</xref> postmaterialism thesis, at least on smaller scales (e.g., poorer, materially insecure respondents indicating high levels of environmental concern), whereby abstract issues such as the environment theoretically become politically salient after baseline needs are secured.</p>
<p>Although generalized austerity, or “sufficiency,” has often been framed as the logical reaction to unsustainable consumption levels (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013916511416647">Princen, 2005</xref>), many behavioral modifications reasonably incur greater costs in terms of either time, money, or both. For instance, research focusing on attitude–behavior gaps often portrays individual and structural constraints as characterized by a lack of time, money, and education, among other resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916511416647">Kennedy, Beckley, McFarlane, &amp; Nadeau, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916511416647">Kollmuss &amp; Agyeman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013916511416647">Taylor, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916511416647">Ellis and Thompson (1997)</xref> theorized that there are also cultural barriers that prevent broader proenvironmental behavior from materializing (i.e., an affirmation of economic growth principles in the United States, etc.). Of course, many environmental problems—namely localized pollution—do pose problems for immediate physical well-being and thus would not necessarily be emblematic of “postmaterial” concerns. Still, many proenvironmental behaviors that require either cost or time premiums deliver benefits, which are less immediately visible than, for example, attenuation of localized pollution (e.g., toxic contamination, particulate reduction, etc.). If these behaviors are to become increasingly diffuse, identifying possible barriers to participation and action—in this case, structural, material, and cultural—is necessary.</p>
<p>Recent research that brings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916511416647">Inglehart’s (1981)</xref> postmaterialism thesis to bear on environmental concern has often found socioeconomic status to be a significant factor in determining attitudes, both in the United States and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916511416647">Franzen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916511416647">Franzen &amp; Meyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916511416647">Kanji &amp; Nevitte, 1997</xref>). These findings, in contrast with others that found no linkages between affluence and concern, paint an equivocal picture of how sociodemographics influence environmental attitudes and related behaviors and illustrate how the conclusions often hinge on changes in operationalization of concepts. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0013916511416647">Uyeki and Holland (2000)</xref> found that generalized environmental concern was common across demographic categories but that those who specifically espoused a “limits to growth” orientation—a central facet of Dunlap’s “New Environmental Paradigm” (NEP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916511416647">Dunlap, 2008</xref>)—had higher incomes and educational attainment. The literature on specific environmental behaviors is often ambiguous, yet provides clues that social class—primarily operationalized as income and education—may play an important role in determining behaviors. Studying these environmental behaviors is crucial to illustrating gaps between attitudes and actions, which may hinge on social class and other structural antecedents.</p>

<title>Literature on Recycling, Consumption, and Civic Behaviors</title>
<p>Recycling (specifically curbside or drop-off disposal of household cardboard, plastics, and so on, intended for reuse) is perhaps the paradigmatic “environmental behavior” due to its expansion in the United States over the last two decades. It is also often the first thing respondents ponder when considering even global environmental problems and related individual actions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0013916511416647">Whitmarsh, 2009</xref>). Although some research has found moderate support for social class as a determinant of recycling behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916511416647">Gamba &amp; Oskamp, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916511416647">Owens, Dickerson, &amp; Macintosh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916511416647">Schultz, Oskamp, &amp; Mainieri, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013916511416647">Sidique, Lupi, &amp; Joshi, 2010</xref>), many researchers have concluded that demographics are generally poor predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916511416647">Derksen &amp; Gartrell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916511416647">Ebreo, Hershey, &amp; Vining, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916511416647">Jenkins, Martinez, Palmer, &amp; Podolsky, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916511416647">Iyer and Kashyap (2007)</xref> found a negative relationship between recycling rates and class metrics but based their findings on a sample of residence halls in a large university setting. Other studies have focused exclusively on psychological variables. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013916511416647">Seacat and Northrup (2010)</xref> examined “value-belief-norm” and “information-motivation-behavioral skill” behavioral models in two relatively affluent, well-educated towns in western Massachusetts. Although at one time, class may have had connections to recycling behaviors simply by virtue of more affluent cities and towns having good programs and the attendant removal of barriers to participation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916511416647">Berger, 1997</xref>), recycling has become common since the early to mid-1990s, when curbside programs were still sparsely instituted. (Although many municipalities have them, recycling programs are not universal, and constraints related to the lack of municipal programs likely characterize many other states, rural areas, etc.) For instance, in Massachusetts, recycling rates have been stagnant for years despite the proliferation of programs, knowledge campaigns, community-level exhortations, and even incentive programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013916511416647">Schworm, 2010</xref>). If sociodemographics are able to predict recycling behaviors, it would be difficult to explain this relationship by positing barriers to participation as a cause given that recycling is no longer restricted to affluent municipalities. Moreover, it could provide further support (on the municipal, rather than national, level) for a postmaterialist reading of environmental behavior, in which poorer or less-educated populations do not translate their environmental concern into behavior on account of the costs involved.</p>
<p>Transportation is one of the largest contributors to total carbon dioxide emissions in the United States and has outstripped other segments in terms of growth over the past four decades (e.g., manufacturing, services, agriculture, etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0013916511416647">Tol, Pacala, &amp; Socolow, 2009</xref>). Personal automotive transportation, among other factors like air travel, is increasingly connected to sustainability, climate, and the environment more generally, with hybrid vehicles becoming more popular in the market as a way to reduce gasoline consumption through fuel efficiency. Although hybrid cars still cost noticeably more than their compact, fuel efficient, conventional counterparts (for example, the 2010 Toyota Corolla starts at US$15,450, whereas the Prius starts at US$22,800<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013916511416647">2</xref></sup>), life cycle analyses show that under certain conditions—for example, high gasoline prices—hybrids may cost less in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916511416647">Lipman &amp; Delucchi, 2006</xref>). However, with the greater initial outlay, one might expect that hybrid auto registrations correlate with metrics of social class. Nevertheless, research has been ambiguous on the subject of environmentally conscious consumer behavior and its relation to variables such as income and education, with many failing to show any support for the expected relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916511416647">Mainieri, Barnett, Valdero, Unipan, &amp; Oskamp, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0013916511416647">Straughan &amp; Roberts, 1999</xref>). Many other studies favor psychological variables or normative attitudes in predicting environmentally conscious purchasing behaviors, rather than demographics. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013916511416647">Roberts and Bacon (1997)</xref> found that those respondents who advocated a “limits to growth” ethos consonant with the NEP disposition were more likely to engage in behavioral modifications in response to the problem (e.g., driving less) rather than frame mitigation efforts in terms of consumptive practices.</p>
<p>Studies examining willingness-to-pay measures are also ambiguous in their conclusions, often finding that demographics have limited predictive power. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916511416647">Laroche, Bergeron, and Barbaro-Forleo (2001)</xref> found that green consumption rates were higher among married females with at least one child, with no other significant demographic variance. Other studies found links between income and willingness to pay but not necessarily in the name of environmental concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0013916511416647">Ubilava, Foster, Lusk, &amp; Nilsson, 2010</xref>). Although “green” consumption is no panacea for global environmental problems (see Alfredsson, 2004, for a critical review), hybrid automobiles are imbued with symbolic power and at least when first introduced in the market signaled an engagement with environmental concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916511416647">Heffner, Kurani, &amp; Turrentine, 2007</xref>, p. 409; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916511416647">Luedicke, Thompson, &amp; Giesler, 2009</xref>). Hybrid vehicle ownership may be important as a socially negotiated symbol of contemporary environmentalism and the possible class strictures involved in those dynamics.</p>
<p>Civic participation has long been theorized to be predicated on resources—namely, time, money, and educational attainment—with empirical research often supporting this view (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916511416647">Brady, Verba, &amp; Schlozman, 1995</xref>). Research examining the social bases of environmental group membership is consistent with this view, with studies showing links between education and political participation in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916511416647">Barkan, 2004</xref>), whereas others show similar results cross-nationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916511416647">Dalton, 2005</xref>). I focus on climate and sustainability advocacy groups in Massachusetts in operationalizing civic engagement for various reasons. First, though many of the local “climate action” groups in Massachusetts are forged under the auspices of reacting to climate change in particular, they often adopt a more generalized proenvironmental rhetoric (e.g., “Sustainable Milton,” which was founded in reaction to climate change but “acts to preserve our ecosystem as a whole”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0013916511416647">3</xref></sup>). Second, these groups are monitored and recognized under the statewide Massachusetts Climate Action Network (MCAN), making definition of the existence of a group within a community consistent. Thus, the local groups under the MCAN umbrella adequately reflect a civic engagement with the environment in a general sense, even if the groups often focus on sustainability efforts in the name of mitigating climate change. As localities (particularly urban areas) have arguably been more robust in their reaction to environmental problems over the last 20 years than the federal government, particularly with respect to global warming (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916511416647">Byrne, Hughes, Rickerson, &amp; Kurdgelashvili, 2007</xref>), it is important to document the social bases for political participation and civic engagement on the issue. Moreover, although “environmental justice” movements sought to bring marginalized social groups into the fold with respect to pollution and environmental issues in the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0013916511416647">Taylor, 2000</xref>), “civic environmentalism” is still characterized by substantive barriers to participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916511416647">Abel &amp; Stephan, 2000</xref>). Finally, examining civic activism on a municipal level may be valuable for illustrating the potential for the social transmission of such behaviors, as researchers contend that personal networks and social ties play crucial roles in political participation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0013916511416647">Tindall, 2002</xref>). If civic action groups predominate in more affluent, better-educated municipalities, it may signify the need to reengage with these questions in examining the barriers to political participation.</p>

<title>The Importance of Social Context and Municipal-Level Data</title>
<p>Little work has examined environmental behaviors on a community level (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916511416647">Kahn, 2007</xref>), though the context of social structure has often been hypothesized as an important determinant of proenvironmental behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916511416647">Guagnano, Stern, &amp; Dietz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0013916511416647">Stern, Dietz, &amp; Guagnano, 1995</xref>). As environmental problems are framed as an ideal example of a prisoner’s dilemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916511416647">Hardin, 1968</xref>), social context is also important in gauging whether values and psychosocial dispositions (altruism, expectations of reciprocity, etc.) can be inculcated on a structural level. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916511416647">Budd, Lovrich, Pierce, and Chamberlain (2008)</xref> found that cities with higher social capital metrics operationalized as attitudes related to trust and free ridership—along with “human capital” metrics—were correlated with sustainability measures such as sprawl (or lack thereof), Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI) membership, and others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0013916511416647">4</xref></sup> As structural settings have also been theorized as an influential factor in specific environmentally conscious behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916511416647">Guerin, Crete, &amp; Mercier, 2001</xref>), community-level data can also provide support for the hypothesis that social environments have an effect on behavior. That is, although antecedent structural variables like social class may influence attitudes and behaviors, norm activation through social context (i.e., recycling because everybody else on the block does so as well) is an important factor in constructing models for action. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013916511416647">Stern (2000)</xref> named “community expectations” as one of the external, contextual variables that contribute to shaping environmental behaviors (p. 417). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013916511416647">Starr (2009)</xref> found that people were more likely to buy “environmentally friendly” material goods when others around them did, which also stresses the importance of norm activation through social context. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013916511416647">Moser (2007)</xref> stressed, there are also relevant political reasons for examining the behaviors on a municipal/regional scale, as the structural components of climate action, in particular, noticeably transcend individualistic behaviors and encompass regional planning and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916511416647">Byrne et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0013916511416647">Zahran, Grover, Brody, &amp; Vedlitz, 2008</xref>). Examining the possible correlations between social class in a community context and metrics of environmental behavior can provide support both for the influence of antecedent structural constraints precluding certain behaviors as well as the possible importance of the social context itself in fostering these behaviors, even if the latter relationship cannot be isolated due to the nature of the data and subsequent inability to determine causation.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The sample consists of municipal-level data from cities and towns in the state of Massachusetts. These data are collected and made available to the public by various state agencies and disseminated by the Boston Globe, and are from the years 2000 (Census figures) through 2010 (e.g., recycling rates are from 2008, hybrid ownership/registration rates from 2009, and MCAN membership from 2010). Recycling data are compiled by cities and towns based on disposal/processing fees (which are themselves based on aggregate weights of waste and recyclables) and are calculated by dividing the total weight of recycled materials by total solid waste output; missing values are the result of municipalities neglecting to report figures.</p>

<p>The primary dependent variables under examination are recycling rates (Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection), proportion of hybrid car ownership (Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles), and existence of a local climate action group (MCAN). Predictors include median per capita income (U.S. Census), proportion of population above the age of 25 possessing a bachelor’s degree (U.S. Census), PhD holders per 1,000 residents (Nielsen/Claritas, via 2004-2009 Census estimates), “culture and recreation” spending per resident (Massachusetts Department of Revenue), average assessed home values (Massachusetts Department of Revenue), proportion of residents under the poverty line (U.S. Census), proportion of municipality that is female (U.S. Census), and proportion of votes for Democratic candidate Deval Patrick in the 2010 gubernatorial election (Massachusetts Election Division, Secretary of State). I argue that the most recent gubernatorial election results are a more accurate indicator of the political character of Massachusetts—widely acknowledged as one of the most reliably liberal states in the United States—than registered party affiliation, as voter registration in the state is characterized by high enrollment of independents, which may obscure these long-standing patterns of voting to the left.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0013916511416647">5</xref></sup> Also included was an ethnic composition variable, the proportion of the municipality of White descent (U.S. Census), as other studies have illustrated that race/ethnicity can be predictive of environmental attitudes and behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013916511416647">Taylor, 1989</xref>), proportion of residents who speak a language other than English in the home (U.S. Census), proportion of foreign-born residents in the municipality (U.S. Census), total population (U.S. Census), and population density (U.S. Census). The presence or nonpresence of curbside recycling and single-stream recycling (Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection) were used in the recycling analysis to control for access issues and behavioral barriers. Detailed explanations of all variables are available in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916511416647">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Analysis Strategy</title>
<p>Because hybrid car ownership and recycling rates are continuous dependent variables, ordinary least squares (OLS) multivariate regression was used to examine the effects of the various independent variables. Binary logistic regression was used for the MCAN dependent variable, as it represents a dichotomous outcome. Data that violated assumptions of normality were logged (for those with positive skew) and squared or cubed (for those with negative skew) to produce acceptable levels of skew. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916511416647">Hamilton’s (1992)</xref> “Interquartile Range” (IQR) test for influential cases and normality indicated no severe outliers in the data for the recycling model. Two outliers were found in the hybrid model; a regression was performed without these potentially influential cases, and the results were substantively similar. Variance factor inflation scores indicated no problems with multicollinearity. The Breusch–Pagan/Cook–Weisberg test was also performed, which indicated no problematic heteroskedasticity for the recycling model (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). Although this test indicated heteroskedasticity in the hybrid model, robust standard errors were used to ameliorate its effects on estimates in all models. No more than 8.2% of cases were missing for any independent variable, whereas many had complete data. Nevertheless, to rectify missing data, multiple imputation by chained equations was used to predict missing values for the independent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511416647">Royston, 2005</xref>). Dependent variables were left out of this process deliberately, as missing cases for recycling rates may reflect a confounding factor (e.g., lack of access to resources or programs). The statistical program (STATA 11.0) was then used to regress the variable with the least missing data on all other independent variables, with the results—adjusted for random error—used to predict values for the missing cases. Imputation progresses from variables with the least to most missing cases until no missing data among the independent variables remain, repeating 5 times, with the results finally combined into a single data set for regression analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916511416647">Enders, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The evidence here shows that to varying degrees, class and culture do have noticeable effects on two of the behaviors examined here. Namely, higher rates of college-educated populations, lower home values, higher proportion of residents who speak a language other than English in the home, higher proportion of Whites, and lower proportion of foreign-born population are all significantly associated with higher rates of recycling. Moreover, greater rates of hybrid auto registration are associated with higher proportion of college-educated residents, higher proportion of Democratic votes, higher culture and recreation spending, and higher home values.</p>
<p>Although consumption behaviors have long been theorized and at times have been shown empirically to correlate with social class, the recycling patterns are more surprising, though still consistent with recent research showing similar, positive effects of education levels (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013916511416647">Sidique et al., 2010</xref>, who examined drop-off recycling behaviors). Although at one time income may have been related to recycling behaviors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916511416647">Schultz et al., 1995</xref>, for a review of early literature), here it is insignificant. This could be because curbside programs have become quite common in recent years, whereby cities and towns with higher property taxes (and presumably property values, general affluence, etc.) are no longer exclusively presenting their residents with the tools necessary to conveniently recycle. Interestingly, higher home values are associated with lower recycling rates, suggesting that the practice, at least in Massachusetts, has become wholly decoupled from most economic metrics on a municipal level.</p>
<p>The significance of education on recycling rates could be indicative of the influence of knowledge of environmental issues on practices, though because recycling is such a “baseline” behavior, it also could indicate generalized cultural resources being important to actualization of attitudes. These results also contrast with previous studies that found no effect of education on recycling behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916511416647">Hopper &amp; Nielsen, 1991</xref>). Although it is tempting to conclude that this is simply a question of knowledge deficiency and that municipalities need to better educate their citizenry on the benefits of recycling, this ignores the qualitative truth that both Massachusetts state officials (e.g., the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection) and individual municipalities have been trying to communicate the upside of the practice for years, with rates remaining stubbornly stagnant.</p>
<p>The effects of proportion of those speaking a language other than English in the home (English as a second language [ESL]) are somewhat surprising given the linguistic barriers to participation in governmental programs. Nevertheless, this could be illustrative of the fact that many of the better-educated towns in Massachusetts do have substantial proportions of “ESL” residents (e.g., Brookline, 76.9% college educated and 29% ESL; Cambridge, 65.1% college educated and 31.2% ESL; Newton, 68% college educated and 21% ESL; etc.). This seems logical, as Massachusetts enjoys comparatively robust higher education, technology, and biomedical sectors, all of which attract international talent. The negative relationship between proportion of foreign-born residents, ethnically White populations, and recycling rates could nevertheless be indicative of a cultural divide, which reflects barriers to engaging with municipal services and the need for municipalities to reach out to these populations in encouraging such behaviors. This could also be indicative, along with the significance of population density, of the access and logistical issues involved in recycling while living in apartment buildings as opposed to homes.</p>
<p>One method of breaching these divides would be to change the focus of communication strategies to how much recycling can save municipalities’ money, establishing a connection between, to use one example, property taxes and the outlay involved in trash disposal. Although recycling is certainly not always a cheaper proposition for a given city or town, and its cost/benefit ratio is subject to a multitude of factors (economies of scale, comprehensiveness of the program, market rates for recyclables, etc.), there is evidence that internalizing the costs associated with landfill disposal through tax mechanisms (e.g., landfill taxes) may encourage greater recycling rates by shrinking the disparities in cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916511416647">Kinnaman, 2006</xref>). Using this market-based method of making recycling more economically expedient (and increasing the desirability of the practice for residents) by internalizing costs may be a more effective method than charging per-unit fees for garbage collection, which in practice would likely be economically regressive, especially considering those cities and towns with lower rates have a higher proportion of foreign-born residents and a lower proportion of college-educated residents.</p>
<p>Cities and towns could also incentivize recycling, such that participants get prizes or other rewards for higher rates. For instance, Everett, Massachusetts, contracts with a private firm that provides gift cards earned by aggregate recycling levels through a point-based system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0013916511416647">Woodruff, Bob, Hill, &amp; Hennessey, 2008</xref>). Municipalities can also target outreach campaigns to immigrant communities, illustrating the benefits of the practice in the process. The influence of curbside recycling programs is to be expected, as this makes the practice practical and convenient for residents. Although the economics of curbside programs are likely a sensitive subject in the context of a waning recession, the aforementioned market-based methods may make such strategies of program expansion more feasible in the face of higher tipping fees for solid waste disposal. Urban municipal governments can also be proactive in ensuring that multiunit apartment buildings have the same capacity and ability to recycle as home owners have.</p>
<p>In the case of hybrids, the effects of education metrics, home values, proportion of Deval Patrick voters, and municipal recreational/cultural spending may be reflective of a cultural divide, whereby the automobiles symbolize a refined, progressive aesthetic or notions of “ethical” consumption, which quite possibly have not diffused throughout different sociocultural strata. Moreover, the clear partisan divide illustrates the possibility that hybrid autos are imbued with liberal political symbolism, such that they reflect the overall ideological commitment of their owners. This may partly be due to the fact that hybrid automobiles are often connected to carbon dioxide emission abatement, which relates to the still highly politicized issue of climate change. Somewhat surprising in the hybrid model is the insignificance of per capita income. The negative relationship between hybrid ownership levels and population density is understandable, considering that areas characterized by lower density likely engender greater overall car ownership, which would reflect an attendant rise in hybrid registration rates.</p>
<p>Still, the significance of the proxy measures of the socioeconomic character of municipalities—culture and recreation spending per resident and home values—lend some support to the notion that generalized affluence (i.e., wealth) may be relevant when discussing hybrid auto purchasing even if income is not. Although hybrid autos deliver high fuel efficiency and can provide financial savings because of this (in life cycle costs, after the initial outlay), they are also frequently connected to narratives of sustainability and carbon emissions (for example, the 2010 Toyota Prius ad campaign: “Harmony between man, nature, and machine.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0013916511416647">7</xref></sup>). As economies of scale render them more competitive, cost savings can be emphasized to minimize any partisan or economic divides with respect to adoption of the technology. Moreover, auto companies are increasingly introducing hybrid drivetrains in a diverse set of models (e.g., sport utility vehicles, luxury sedans, etc.). Although environmentalists are often wary of such practices, preferring to see a commitment to ultralow fuel economy vehicles across the board, this still may be an effective tactic at getting those into the fold who otherwise would be resistant to the technology.</p>
<p>Car manufacturers could also stress the lowering cost premiums involved in buying hybrid drivetrains in attempting greater popularization. One related problem is the fact that hybrid autos are more expensive to manufacture, which presents conventional (and, frequently, larger and less efficient) platforms as the most profitable options for manufacturers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916511416647">Lave &amp; MacLean, 2002</xref>). This problem is more difficult to resolve; incentivizing the purchase of more efficient autos and stoking demand for them threatens to bring in more material barriers to hybrid consumption. Moreover, mechanisms by which demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles is increased (e.g., gas taxes) are historically unpopular with the American electorate as well as regressive to varying extents. The Federal Government could, alternatively, strengthen Corporate Automobile Fuel Efficiency standards, while introducing incentives (tax breaks, etc.) for meeting the more robust benchmarks on an industrial scale.</p>
<p>MCAN group presence, unlike the other variables, was not subject to the influence of educational capital and many cultural indicators. This suggests that affluence and college-educated residential population among others are not predictive of cities’ and towns’ formation of environmental advocacy groups. Nevertheless, the effects of population density suggest that more urban areas have better odds of fostering participation in MCAN. Just as rural areas pool resources to deliver their residents recycling programs (albeit usually of the drop-off variety), those less densely populated towns in Massachusetts could collectively engage in civic group formation, making continued support via the citizenry more feasible. For example, the “Franklin-area Climate Team” is a chapter of MCAN collectively composed of the towns of Franklin, Wrentham, Bellingham, Foxboro, Norfolk, and Plainville. Moreover, the significance of Democratic votes illustrates—at least on a municipal scale—the partisan dimensions of issues like climate change and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that cultural and economic resources solidly predict civic engagement, which suggests that those who are engaged politically have the tools and skills to actualize their concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916511416647">Galston, 2007</xref>). This is echoed by other studies that examined environmental action and civic participation, where education was found to be significant in predicting engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916511416647">Barkan, 2004</xref>). Encouragingly, Massachusetts seems to evade this phenomenon—at least with respect to MCAN—though other regions, particularly those characterized by greater inequality or demographic segregation, may not. The relevance of political indicators suggests that municipalities work to connect issues of sustainability with issues of material security and economic well-being, bridging the gap between the discourses of sustainability and conservative austerity. Of course, these groups present the possibility of engaging residents on a whole range of behaviors by connecting abstract environmental issues with basic, everyday practices. Municipal government leaders could spearhead the creation of local environmental groups and encourage participation by holding events and gatherings along with partnering with neighboring cities and towns, while also soliciting input for policy changes that would make it more convenient for residents to engage in other behaviors (i.e., gauging support for enhanced recycling programs, etc.).</p>
<sec id="section15-0013916511416647">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Because this research is based on a municipal unit level of analysis, claims cannot be made about individual-level behaviors. Another inherent limitation is the lack of complete data, particularly for recycling rates. Although municipalities are encouraged by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to submit figures, they are not compelled to. The regional character of the data also prevents generalizing the results to the rest of the United States. Massachusetts is a relatively affluent and particularly well-educated state, and results from other states or regions could presumably indicate greater (or less) variation. The operationalization of environmental behaviors is also limited to the three metrics presented in this analysis, though realistically acting in a “sustainable” fashion goes well beyond the bounds of the measures used here. Also, because the data are being analyzed on a municipal level, I was unable to include psychosocial variables, which are important facets of comprehensive models of environmental behavior and attitudes. Moreover, although the variance of behaviors across different municipalities may be suggestive of the influence of social context in a general way, the cross-sectional nature of the data prevents any assertions of causation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0013916511416647">
<title>Suggestions for Future Research</title>
<p>As the data were of municipal level, there is an intriguing possibility that these behaviors are partially influenced by the social context they take place in. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013916511416647">Mood (2010)</xref> examined Swedish panel data and concluded that participation in welfare programs may be influenced by others already receiving benefits in one’s neighborhood. Future studies could be conducted, which assess the potential for “contagiousness” with respect to environmental behaviors. Do residents recycle more because they see their neighbors doing so? and conversely, do residents <italic>not</italic> bother recycling because their neighbors do not either? Still, for all the import in examinations of the influence of social capital and norm activation, these considerations should not be divorced from baseline sociostructural variables, which may be influential not only in their own right but also in determining these interpersonal linkages and normative orientations as well. Further research should be conducted to determine whether, indeed, sociocultural and sociostructural variables are more important in determining these phenomena than we have been led to believe by the diffusion of attitudes and concern over the decades.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although it is unsurprising that some social class metrics would positively correlate with the purchasing of “green” durable goods such as hybrid automobiles or with behaviors that incur costs of time like recycling, it is curious that education levels and political ideology were found to be more relevant than economic metrics in this analysis. This suggests that at least in this context, the postmaterialism thesis on a micro level is limited in its explanatory power (e.g., recycling being more popular in municipalities where more residents have their material needs met), though the results for recycling rates and hybrid ownership do illustrate the possible salience of the related “new class” theory in examining these behaviors (i.e., educated professionals socialized in a materially secure environment who affirm postmaterial political concerns and have the resources to actualize them; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916511416647">Gouldner, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916511416647">Inglehart, 1981</xref>). In this regional context, policy makers should focus as much or more on cultural factors than economic constraints in promoting certain behaviors. The state and municipal authorities can also promote incentives that are not directly economic based, such as high-occupancy vehicle lane access for hybrid automobiles, recycling contests among different cities, and civic programs, which engage residents on a host of issues that deal with both local and global environmental issues. Creative solutions are necessary if environmental behaviors—no matter how seemingly inconsequential in the grand scheme—are to become a hallmark of communities across the United States and not just those that are well educated or politically liberal.</p>
