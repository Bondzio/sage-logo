<body>
<p>In 1984 when I received a copy of the first edition of <italic>Nurses and Families: A Guide to Family Assessment and Intervention</italic>, I excitedly took it to a meeting on nursing and families at the National Institutes of Health. My excitement was because the book was based on strengths of families rather than pathology and was superbly written by seasoned clinicians. Now in 2013, I hold the 6th edition. I have looked forward to each edition as I know of the careful review and efforts these scholar authors apply to ensure the latest edition contains the most recent theory, science, and clinical knowledge to inform family nursing practice. While the authors state they continue with the primary purpose to be a “how to” basic text, this book is far more.</p>
<p>The strengths of this edition build from those of the earlier editions. The significance that the authors are excellent clinician/educators/scholars who have systematically documented their practice outcomes for decades cannot be overstated. One of the most notable strengths of all editions and what fueled my excitement of the first edition in 1984 is the focus on family strengths. The authors have placed the edition in the context of their “real life” practice with families and in the current health and social policy of the United States and Canada. This relevancy is important to the readers. The progress in the globalization of family nursing is exciting information; the authors note that the previous editions have been published in eight languages and used in 24 countries. With the advances in this edition these numbers should increase.</p>
<p>As the authors note context, they also describe the changes in their thinking about practice with families. It is important for all clinicians, researchers, and educators to have the evidence of the evolution of thinking and practice for even the most seasoned clinicians. The authors describe their shifting relationship with families to be more collaborative and influenced by a postmodernist worldview. In addition to the changes in their thinking and practice, the authors have improved the format of this edition. It is more readable with color used effectively in the graphs, text boxes, and diagrams. This change is most facilitative to the first time reader to track the progression of the information. The readers have access to many resources from this evolving evidence-based clinical model. The resources are made available through the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.familynursingresources.com">www.familynursingresources.com</ext-link> web site and include educational DVDs.</p>
<p>The authors cite <italic>new</italic> content and features that add to the significant contributions of this 6th edition. A new chapter has been added “<italic>How to move beyond basic family nursing skills.”</italic>  This chapter will guide the readers of previous editions to advance their practice.</p>
<p>An important strength is that there is more research reported on application of the Calgary Family Assessment Model (CFAM) and the Calgary Family Intervention Model (CFIM). The research citations related to these important clinically based models and interventions is a landmark for the book and for family nursing. Not only is the content updated, there are more theory and research references included to provide evidence for the CFAM/CFIM models. More complex genograms have been added to facilitate the assessment of the various structures of families. In future editions, including a discussion of the genogram aligned with the family health history would guide the reader to the era of genetics/genomics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hhs.gov/familyhistory/portrait/index.html">http://www.hhs.gov/familyhistory/portrait/index.html</ext-link>). A description and function of the ecomap is included with the genogram. This is an important family assessment tool rarely described in the nursing literature. The ecomap adds an important dimension of the environment to family assessment and can guide the family to problem-solve for the changes in family functions, activities, and resources due to health and family structure challenges. In addition, more complex family situations are described with interventions to advance nurses’ competencies in family nursing.</p>
<p>Reviewers are identified for this book and this is another important addition. While they may have contributed to previous editions, recognizing this significant role is an important addition.</p>
<p>The quality, usability, and relevance for this essential book for nurses to advance their care of families have evolved with the practice and scholarship of the authors. This book remains a must have for <italic>all</italic> nurses who care for families.</p>
