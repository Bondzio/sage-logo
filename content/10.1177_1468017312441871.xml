<sec id="sec1-1468017312441871"><title>Carolyn Noble and Mark Henrickson (eds), <italic>Social work field education and supervision across Asia Pacific</italic>. Sydney, Australia: Sydney University Press, 2011, 402 pp., AUD50.00 (pbk), ISBN 9781920899691.</title>
<p><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> Barbara Staniforth, <italic>University of Auckland, New Zealand</italic></p>
<p>In 2009 the Asia-Pacific Association for Social Work Education (APASWE), the Korean Association of Social Workers and the Korean Council on Social Welfare Education jointly sponsored a Dean’s forum on social work education and practice development in the Asia-Pacific region. Many ideas and initiatives grew from this forum including two edited volumes of writings dealing with social work education and field practice in the region. The first was published in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017312441871">Noble, Henrickson, &amp; Han, 2009</xref>) and this is the follow-up text focusing specifically on field education and supervision.</p>
<p>There are four sections in the book, representing field work theory, placement experiences, the policy environment and supervision. There are 17 chapters, each with its own abstract written in Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean. Most chapters are written in English, but there are also three chapters written in Korean, Chinese and Japanese respectively. The book represents a good cross-section and collaboration of writing from field education academics, field education (agency) teachers, supervisors and students.</p>
<p>The book is well set out in Noble’s introduction. The editors are clear that the book has been conceptualized and put together with the intention of providing ideas to consider and <italic>adapt</italic> rather than <italic>adopt</italic>. Readers are encouraged to take a critical and reflective/reflexive stance and this is a theme which appears consistently throughout most chapters of the book. This is one of the features which makes this text relevant across cultures within the Asia-Pacific region, but also enables it to be relevant to many different international and cross-cultural situations.</p>
<p>This book should be a ‘must read’ for any student or social work educator considering cross-border placements. Several chapters describe the process and experience of placements occurring outside of a student’s home country or culture. Key themes emerge through these chapters. The importance of good preparation is echoed throughout all of the writings dealing with international placements. Academic preparation, logistical preparation, emotional preparation of the students and planning for the integration of theory and practice throughout the placements are all discussed. The importance of a strong and collaborative relationship between student, supervisor and social work programme faculty is emphasised throughout. The increasing accessibility of cross border placements and supervision through use of modern technologies such as email or Skype is a recurring theme in many of the contributions. Recommendations for students and social work educators considering international placements are made by several authors. Again, while these suggestions are made within an Asia-Pacific context, they are generalizable across many contexts.</p>
<p>Good attention has been given to fieldwork occurring within indigenous contexts. Green and Baldry describe placement experiences of indigenous and non-indigenous social work students working within programs run by/for indigenous (Aboriginal) people in Australia. These experiences are described through various lenses and the chapter is very thought-provoking. The importance of knowledge of self for students is also emphasized throughout the text and tools for the development of knowledge and use of self are described in various chapters.</p>
<p>A ‘stand out’ chapter is that written by Noble on building a critical perspective on field education and supervision. Noble provides a very clear and accessible description of critical theory for social work with an emphasis on social justice and human rights. This chapter should be considered for inclusion in any social work course list of readings as it goes to the heart of what may unite us as a profession.</p>
<p>The editors have made every effort to move beyond the academic hegemonic tradition of all chapters being written in English. This leaves the reader with the challenge of seeking translation for the three chapters which describe social work field education and issues within Korean, Taiwanese and Japanese settings. While somewhat frustrating, this does create empathy and an increased consciousness for the plight of non-English-speaking people who have had to contend with this situation over and over again.</p>
<p>While written mainly by authors situated throughout the Asia-Pacific region, the description of experiences and knowledge generated from them is in no way limited to this context. The book has much to offer social work students, academics and fieldwork educators within many different international and cultural contexts.</p>
