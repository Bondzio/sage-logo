<abstract>
<p>This article presents a small state’s perspectives on military socialization by examining military interactions at political and strategic, operational, and tactical as well as educational tiers. Transnational military socialization creates learning and socializing environments for militaries. However, the transnational military socialization process in Asia has received little scholarly attention, although its nature changed dramatically after the Cold War and 9/11. A small state often enters into asymmetric socialization with major powers. Mongolia presents an interesting case to capture these changes and impacts of transnational military interactions. The Mongolian military internalized Soviet military norms, ideas, and values during its seventy-year military socialization process. Since then, it has been attempting to disconnect from its communist past by internalizing the Western military norms, ideas, and culture even though it is isolated from the Western world. Interactions between Sino-Mongolian militaries over the past two decades have not resulted in any in-depth exchanges of ideas due to political, historical, and cultural factors. In the absence of explicit pressures from these three major powers, today the Mongolia military has consolidated a new identity, similar to a Western military. It has increased its contribution to peace support operations while attempting to disconnect its Soviet past and avoiding absorption from the growing Chinese military initiatives toward Central Asia. At the same time, Mongolia’s military socialization with Russian or American militaries often triggers uncertainty for Chinese security.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Generally, academic discourses center on the use of defense cooperation and diplomacy by major powers to diffuse or even impose their values and norms on the militaries of developing nations. Not enough attention has been paid to motivations and reactions of small state militaries. This article brings with a discussion of small state’s perspectives to understanding the military socialization process.</p>
<p>Military socialization is the most visible, salient part of the state socialization process. But much remains unknown about military socialization. Its transnational dimension has increased dramatically since the end of the Cold War and the events of September 11, 2001. These pose intriguing questions: Are there any noticeable changes in small states’ militaries? How can we examine analytically the dynamics of the military socialization process?</p>
<p>This article attempts to answer these questions based on examination of the Mongolian case. Mongolia’s case is interesting for several reasons. First, Mongolia is a geostrategic spot with military–strategic significance for major powers; therefore, it interacts with three major powers with different military norms, identity, and culture. Second, within Mongolia, there have been noticeable normative changes from a communist militarized state to a liberal democratic state since 1990.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095327X12441323">1</xref>
</sup> Third, its Soviet military identity has been changing into a distinctly North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-oriented military identity. Finally, Mongolia’s small military has become an important foreign policy instrument for confidence building with its neighbors and the advancement of its third neighbor policy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0095327X12441323">2</xref>
</sup> However, Mongolian military interactions with major powers cause security dilemmas for its neighbors. Although the Mongolian military was periodically expanded during the Soviet–Japanese war in 1939 and 1945 as well as during the Sino-Soviet confrontation in 1960–1989, today it maintains about 10,000 active duty personnel in a single service (army) military.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0095327X12441323">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This article first introduces an analytical framework, then examines Mongolia’s military interactions with Russian, American, and Chinese militaries, and concludes with a few thoughts on the small state’s military socialization process. The data for this article have been drawn from primary sources in Mongolia, academic literatures, and international and Mongolian media sources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0095327X12441323">
<title>Analytical Framework for Transnational Military Socialization</title>
<p>The study of military socialization has been an important topic in international relations and military sociology. Earlier studies of military socialization mostly concentrated on socialization processes through the military services in the Western world and political socialization in communist states.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0095327X12441323">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the scholarly literature that deals with military socialization since 1990s, most academic and policy debates have centered on the Western-led process of military socialization to consolidate democratic civil–military relations and professional military standards in developing nations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0095327X12441323">5</xref>
</sup> However, they have failed to explain the motivations and resistance of small state militaries to attempts by major power-led military socialization processes and have neglected the cross-learning dynamics of the socializees. Although this process appears to be a one-way learning process, it is not. Major powers do learn from small states.</p>
<p>I define <italic>military socialization as a learning process, in which members of military institution transmit, internalize new norms, ideas and values as well as consolidate or redefine their collective identity.</italic> In broader terms, defense diplomacy serves as a medium for the military socialization process. But it is important to highlight that all interactions that happen through defense diplomacy and cooperation do not result in internalizing norms, ideas, and values.</p>
<sec id="section3-0095327X12441323">
<title>Modes of Military Socialization</title>
<p>Transnational military socialization of a small state occurs through the <italic>self-generated motivation</italic> of the small state or through the <italic>limited persuasion, persuasion,</italic> and <italic>coercion</italic> of a major power. <italic>Self-generated motivation</italic> derives from the small state’s security needs for protection, access to defense equipment and training, and confidence building. <italic>Persuasion</italic> could be limited if the major power lacks political will and resources to persuade the small state; therefore, I use the term <italic>limited persuasion </italic>as a separate mode rather than standard<italic> persuasion</italic>, which is backed up by material inducements and sanctions of the major power. The hegemonic power or regional major powers use <italic>limited persuasion</italic>, <italic>persuasion,</italic> and/or <italic>coercion</italic> to change norms, interests, and behaviors of the small state.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0095327X12441323">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The small state is mostly in control over its military interactions with other militaries when socialization is occurring through the <italic>self-generated </italic>mode or <italic>limited persuasion </italic>of the major power. Therefore, the internalization of norms, ideas, and values may be slow and the small state may able to consolidate its own independent identity. In the case of <italic>persuasion</italic> and <italic>coercion</italic>, the major power advances its norms, ideas, and values; therefore, the major power is in control of the socialization process.</p>
<p>The scope and frequency of military socialization of the small state will depend on the nature of the overall relationship with the major power. If the nature of the relationship is alliance or partnership-based, the military socialization process will be <italic>binding</italic> and military interactions will be closer and broader. If the overall state-to-state interaction is uncertain, military socialization processes will be constrained and <italic>nonbinding</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0095327X12441323">
<title>Key Factors</title>
<p>Among many factors, there are several important ones we need take into account. First, the legacy of previous military socialization processes, even if not completed, will pose challenges to any new socialization efforts. For example, beliefs in the effectiveness of the previous military institutions will remain high among military elites and unfamiliarity or even mistrust about major power can hinder closer interaction. Second, generational changes will impact the military socialization process—attitudes toward major powers will change overtime depending on first and secondhand experience of each generational cohort dealing with the militaries of major powers. Third, interests and beliefs of ruling political and military elites are influential to define goals, nature, and scope of military interactions. Because of the military’s desire to compare with others and corporate interests of advancing military’s role in foreign policy, the military attempts to influence the thinking of ruling elites. If their professional desires match with the political elites’ interest and beliefs, the military socialization process could proceed smoothly. At the same time, the military can facilitate a gradual understanding, subsequently, promoting the closer interactions between socializing states. Fourth, the political will and the economic capacity of the major power are other key factors. If the major power does not have strong security and economic interests or there are competing interests from other major powers in the small state, the military socialization process may not result in changing norms or identity. Rivalry among major powers increases the ability of the small power to control its military interactions with all major powers and to consolidate its own identity, distinct from any of these militaries. The last factor is the economic capacity of the small state. If the small state is economically independent, it will be in control of its military interactions with the major powers—its military could even transmit its norms, ideas, and values through its socialization processes to others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0095327X12441323">
<title>A Three-Tiered Framework</title>
<p>Because militaries operate at three interconnected “top-down” levels (i.e., strategic, operational, and tactical), it is plausible to assume that their transnational interactions also occur at the same levels. Using this generic hierarchical structure, we can employ three interconnected tiers conceptually to analyze the military socialization process. This framework will consist of <italic>the political and strategic tier, the operational and tactical tier, </italic>and<italic> the educational tier. </italic>Each tier involves different actors. The <italic>political and strategic</italic> tier is represented by political leaders, senior defense officials, and strategic level military leaders; the <italic>operational and tactical</italic> tier involves mid-level officers and below; and <italic>educational</italic> tier refers to defense educational institutions, think tanks, and professional military educational and training institutions. Although defense education and training are institutionalized on the principle of military operational hierarchy as strategic, operational, and tactical, they involve more relaxed learning and socializing environment for military personnel. Therefore, educational interactions should be treated as a separate socialization tier. Depending on the level of trust and nature of defense cooperation, educational tier interactions are further classified into two subcategories: <italic>educational exchanges</italic> to promote confidence building and <italic>professional military exchanges</italic> to improve interoperability. Based on its professional development system, military personnel move along this operational hierarchy. Generally, military officers start their career at the tactical level, then move to the operational, and a few manage to serve at the political and strategic levels.</p>
<p>This framework for the study of military socialization provides an important point of entry to understand motives, intensity, and effects of the military socialization process at different levels. If the nature of the state-to-state relations is closer, or <italic>binding</italic>, then we should see a high frequency of military interactions at all three tiers with more interactions at operational and tactical tiers as well as more professional military exchanges. As a result of this socialization process, the small state’s military will consolidate a similar identity and internalize the norms and values of the major power’s military. If the nature of the state socialization is <italic>nonbinding</italic>, then military interactions will be limited to the political and strategic tier as well as the educational tier. Between this spectrum (continuum) of <italic>binding</italic>, a military alliance type, and the <italic>nonbinding</italic>, confidence building type, we could observe a variety of dynamics of the military socialization process. Examining the frequency, scale, duration, and types of military interactions at each tier will help to assess the nature of military-to-military interactions and motives, intensity, and effects of the military socialization process. The next part will employ this framework to examine the Mongolian military’s socialization processes with the militaries of Russia, United States, and China.</p>

<title>Mongolian Military Socialization with Major Powers</title>
<p>A landlocked, sparsely populated Mongolia obtained its sovereignty in 1911, when it detached from the collapsing Chinese Qing Dynasty. But, its sovereignty was jeopardized by a covert deal between Russia and China in 1915 and it was invaded by Chinese military forces as well as fleeing Tsarist Russian military until its independence in 1921.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0095327X12441323">7</xref>
</sup> Mongolia was also attacked by Japan in 1939 and survived through the Cold War as the Soviet geostrategic buffer against China.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0095327X12441323">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Since the end of the Cold War, Mongolia has strived to keep a balance between its two populous, armed, nuclear neighbors and to reach out to other partners beyond its neighbors. Since Mongolia is geographically isolated from other middle and small powers, the study of Mongolian military socialization can reveal the intensity of asymmetric interactions between the small and major powers. Generally, the Mongolian military socialization process could be divided into four periods as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095327X12441323">Table 1</xref>. In the first three periods, Mongolia internalized the Soviet norms and in the last period, it has been internalizing more Western norms as its interaction with the United States increases.</p>

<p>From 1920 till 1989, Mongolia internalized communist civil–military relations norms such as ideological and repressive controls by the communist party and adopted the Soviet military doctrine, organizations, structures, and military culture. As a result, the Mongolian military consolidated the same identity as other communist militaries in Eastern and Central Europe. Although the initial Mongolian military socialization with Russia caused by the <italic>self-generated motivations</italic> of Mongols, Russia employed both persuasion and coercion whenever Russia needed to deploy its military assets into Mongolian territory in accordance with its geostrategic interests.</p>
<p>The Mongolian military interactions with the US military were initiated in the early 1990s. As a result, Mongolia adopted the norms of democratic civil–military relations such as having a civilian defense minister and transparency in defense policy and spending. It oriented itself toward military professionalism, reducing its reliance on conscription and relinquishing its socioeconomic roles. The Mongolian military joined the nascent US-led Asia Pacific cooperative security arrangements as well as in military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo. In the absence of the explicit US geostrategic and economic interests in Mongolia, Mongolia’s military socialization with the US military was caused by both <italic>self-generated</italic> Mongolian motivation and US <italic>limited persuasion</italic>.</p>
<p>Chinese and Mongolian military interactions merely focused on confidence building. This was the main aim between 1946 and 1963 and again now. Therefore, military exchanges are mostly concentrated at the political and strategic as well as educational tiers. However, Mongolia’s growing interactions with Russia and now the United States and India are often viewed by Chinese military as a threat to Chinese security due to Mongolia’s geographic proximity. Similarly, China’s military buildup and its desire to push operational and tactical tier interactions with Mongolia definitely cause concerns among Mongolian elites and public. This limits the degree of the military socialization process to transmit norms, ideas, and values between Sino-Mongolian militaries.</p>
<sec id="section7-0095327X12441323">
<title>Mongolian–Russian Military Socialization</title>
<p>The Mongolian military’s socialization process with the Russian military is the longest. Although historical accounts about Russian involvement in Mongolian revolutions in early 1900s are still debated, historical facts and geopolitical reality demonstrate that the military socialization process with both Imperial Russia in 1913 and Soviet Russia in the 1920s was initiated by the <italic>self-generated motivation</italic> of the Mongolian political elites. However, this self-motivation was overshadowed by <italic>coercion</italic> and <italic>persuasion</italic> by the Soviet Union in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1960s to establish its military presence in Mongolia to support its geopolitical objectives to deter Japanese and Chinese expansions toward Siberia. The Soviets executed Mongolian political and military leaders who opposed the Soviet military presence in Mongolia in 1920–1940.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0095327X12441323">9</xref>
</sup> Later, the Soviets persuaded Mongolian political leaders in 1960s since most of them were educated in the Soviet Union. Though Mongolian political and military elites were in control of their own military forces, the Soviets were in control of the overall socialization process by providing military advisors, training for Mongolian officers and specialists, and arming the Mongolian Armed Forces. Following each withdrawal of Russian forces from Mongolia, the Mongolian political and military elites often expressed their interests to maintain its national defense capability, but these <italic>self-generated motivations</italic> for closer military interactions were often ignored by Russians. For example, Russia withdrew its military forces from Mongolia 3 times in 1925, 1945, and 1989 in response to Chinese requirements to normalize Sino-Russo relations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0095327X12441323">10</xref>
</sup> Mongolian elites requested Russian military assistance in 1940s and 1990s. Russia was unable to respond due to its cautiousness about a Chinese reaction, its economic downturn, and its lack of political and strategic interest in Mongolia especially after Russia normalized its relations with China. The nature of Mongolia’s military socialization process with Russia was <italic>binding </italic>between 1920 and 1989 and became <italic>nonbinding </italic>after its withdrawal of military forces from Mongolia in 1989.</p>
<p>As the binding nature of military socialization entails commitments for alliance and mutual defense assistance obligations, both militaries interacted closely at all tiers of the military socialization process till 1989. At the political and strategic tiers, the Soviets consolidated pro-communist Mongolian political and military leaders. As the number of Soviet-educated elites increased from 1940s, interactions among Soviet and Mongolian political and military elites increased. Under the 1936 and 1966 mutual defense agreements, military socialization at the operational and tactical as well as educational tiers was institutionalized closely between the two militaries. The operational and tactical tier interactions were increased as the Soviet military units were stationed in Mongolia and reduced when the Soviet military departed. The Soviets deployed 13,000 military personnel in 1921 to support Mongolian military’s operations against fleeing Tsarist Russian military units, 25,000 in 1936–1939 to fight against Japanese, and 82,000 in 1965–1992 to pressure China militarily.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0095327X12441323">11</xref>
</sup> In all occasions, Mongolian military units were structured to conduct combined military operations. This interoperability was tested thorough a series of large-scale military exercises since 1973. Between 1921 and 1926, the Soviets assisted establishing the Mongolian military schools by introducing Soviet educational and training materials, manuals, regulations, drills, and customs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0095327X12441323">12</xref>
</sup> Since 1921, Mongolian military officers were able to interact with their Soviet counterparts as well as others from communist and developing nations during their training in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>These closer interactions at all socialization tiers were impacted greatly when the bilateral relationship became <italic>nonbinding </italic>following the demise of the Soviet Empire. There were only sporadic interactions, mostly initiated by the Mongolian side, at the political and strategic tier in 1990–2000. Interactions at the operational and tactical as well as educational tiers almost ceased completely. This was similar to most former communist bloc nations. Although defense cooperation resumed in 2000, it has been unsubstantial in comparison with earlier periods since neither party currently upholds any common values or collective defense obligations. Nonetheless, Russian military training assistance increased in significantly. The annual bilateral military exercise, <italic>Darkhan</italic>, is considered the largest, political and strategic tier exchange, along with the provision of Russian military equipment resumed in 2003. There are several reasons behind this sudden upsurge in Mongolian and Russian military interactions. First, Russia does not want to lose its relative advantage in Mongolian military affairs to either the United States or China. Its interest can be explained in the context of the Russian policy, advanced by President Putin, to reassert its influence in the former Soviet Union’s sphere of influence. Second, Mongolian military leaders, many of whom graduated from the Soviet military schools, realized that only way to modernize their military arsenal is through Russia.</p>
<p>Over the last two decades, Mongolia requested military–technical assistance from Western nations and attempted to increase their strategic interests in Mongolia, but the West has been cautious and reluctant to provide military technical assistance to Mongolia to avoid antagonizing either Russia or China. One important feature of the current Mongolian and Russian military interactions is that now Mongolians are in control, while Russians are using <italic>limited persuasion</italic> to regain its status of benevolent protector.</p>
<p>As a result of seventy years of the military socialization processes, Mongolia adopted communist civil–military relations norms and consolidated a Soviet-style identity for the Mongolian military. The Mongolian Communist Party institutionalized ideological control over the military through the Party Central Committee, its Military Political Departments, and political commissars, who were in charge of the political indoctrination, education, and training of the military. The military was also under the institutionalized surveillance by the intelligence service. It wielded less power and authority in Mongolian society than the Party and Intelligence. The Soviet military linear warfare doctrine, strategy, and tactics were simply translated into Mongolian, the Soviet-style military decision-making process, which heavily relied on the party and senior military leaders, was adopted, and the Soviet Army education and training system was replicated in Mongolia. The party affiliation, education in Russian military schools, and Russian language skills were the most important aspects for Mongolian military personnel.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0095327X12441323">13</xref>
</sup> Soviet military values, symbols, uniform, and customs (e.g., military parade) were introduced by Soviet military advisors and by Mongolian military officers, educated in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Mongolian military also internalized negative Soviet military norms such as alcoholism and hazing especially among the conscripts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0095327X12441323">14</xref>
</sup> Since the nature of military socialization was binding in 1921–1989, the Mongolian military was organized similarly to the Soviet military and equipped with Soviet-made weapons and equipment to maintain a high degree of interoperability. The socialization process with the Soviet military was easier since Mongolia had a legacy of military interaction with Soviets and Soviet culture, especially since many Mongolians had Russian language skills. In 1992, Mongolia declared its intention to refrain from any military allies and staging foreign military troops in Mongolian territory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0095327X12441323">15</xref>
</sup> The new bilateral treaty of 1993 did not include the mutual military assistance clause of the 1966 treaty with the Soviet Union and stated that “parties shall not enter into any military-political bloc directed against each other and are committed not to conclude with third parties any treaties and agreements contradicting the interests of sovereignty and independence of the other party.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0095327X12441323">16</xref>
</sup> This was indicative of the new type of military socialization: one without any binding obligations.</p>
<p>Since 1989, as Mongolia became a democracy, numerous measures were taken to disconnect from its Soviet past. The Communist Party and intelligence control were abolished in 1990 and new national security concepts and military doctrines were adopted. Mongolian national values, symbols, uniforms, and customs were stressed over the Soviet ones.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0095327X12441323">17</xref>
</sup> For example, traditional military horse hair banners, marching music, rank symbols, verbal commands, and new military uniforms replaced the Soviet symbols. Teaching, research, and publication of military warfare and cavalry tactics of Mongolian Empires were allowed in military educational programs. Innovative thinking to develop national military strategy, doctrines, and warfare methods were debated at all levels of the military institutions. Ideological and Soviet educational prerequisites for military personnel were dropped as Russo-Mongolian binding socialization process ceased in 1990s. The Mongolian political and military elites obtained opportunities to consolidate a new Mongolian military identity distinct from that of its neighbors’.</p>

<title>Military Socialization with the United States</title>
<p>The Mongolian military socialization process with the American military was the result of the <italic>self-generated motivation</italic> of Mongolia as well as <italic>limited persuasion</italic> employed by the United States. As the United States played a crucial role in supporting Mongolia’s transition to democracy and a free market economy after establishment of the bilateral relations in 1987, Mongolian political elites were keen to develop bilateral relations in all dimensions, including the military.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0095327X12441323">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mongolian military leaders, still perceiving the world with a Cold War mentality, were cautious, but willing to interact with the US military: first, to access military technical assistance; second, to learn about professional military in a democracy and free market economy; and, third, to build confidence with its former “enemy.” For US military leaders, unlike their counterparts at the State Department, Mongolia was not an interesting spot for several reasons. First, because of its location, any extensive military interactions with Mongolia could be perceived as a threat to China and Russia. Second, unlike other postcommunist states in Europe or Soviet republics, it was unthinkable to include Mongolia in any collective security institutions or to establish a bilateral alliance. Third, the Mongolian military’s capability was unknown because there was no prior knowledge or interactions. Therefore, the United States used <italic>limited persuasion</italic> to sponsor Mongolia’s participation in the US-led multilateral events in the Asia Pacific Region, to offer educational and training assistance, and to provide humanitarian assistance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0095327X12441323">19</xref>
</sup> Since the nature of the military socialization process with the United States is <italic>nonbinding</italic>, Mongolians have been in control of this socialization process while US influence has been constrained due to limited interest and resources.</p>
<p>The socialization process with the United States could be divided into two periods: 1992 to 2003 and 2003 to present. The first period could be characterized as a learning phase, in which both sides interacted merely at the educational tier. In contrast, interactions have occurred at all tiers in the second period, so there are some noticeable effects of the military socialization process since 2003.</p>
<p>In the first period, although Mongolia made several efforts to advance bilateral military cooperation, the United States was reluctant. Mongolia posted its permanent defense attaché in 1993, while the United States posted its permanent defense attaché in 1999.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0095327X12441323">20</xref>
</sup> Interactions at the political and strategic tier were limited to sporadic visits by senior leaders of the US Pacific Command and bilateral meetings at the side of the US-hosted multilateral events in the Asia Pacific Region. The highest achievement of this period was the Agreement on Military Exchanges and Visits concluded after much consultation involving the Pentagon in 1996.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0095327X12441323">21</xref>
</sup> This was the first military exchange agreement that the Mongolian government concluded with the West. The interactions at the educational tier started in 1992, when the United States included Mongolia in its International Military Education and Training (IMET) program. The initial training assistance was directed to develop English language training capacity and to expose new topics such as democratic civil–military relations, defense resource management, and peacekeeping through in-country seminars. Later in 1996, limited slots at the US professional military educational programs (Command Staff Colleges, Postgraduate Programs) were offered to Mongolian military personnel. Also, in this period, the United States helped the Mongolian military interact with other militaries in the Asia Pacific Region at various multilateral events. Because of its self-generated motivation to interact with the United States and its allies, the Mongolian military became an active participant and supporter of US initiatives for Asia-Pacific cooperative security, especially in peacekeeping.</p>
<p>The second period of the socialization process started as the Mongolian government decided to participate in the US-led military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003. Interactions between political and military leaders at the political and strategic tier became more frequent. Following Mongolian participation in coalition operations, annual defense consultative talks with the Office of the Secretary of Defense, meetings between Defense Ministers at the Shangri-la Dialogue, and Chiefs of Defense meetings at the Chiefs of Defense Conference became annual events, which were indicative of qualitative changes in bilateral relations. Another indication of these attitudinal changes was the declaration of the US official commitment to assist Mongolia to deepen its military reform toward peace support operations in 2003. Later it was outlined more succinctly in the US administration’s statements as to “develop a friendly and capable coalition partner, fully interoperable with U.S. forces.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0095327X12441323">22</xref>
</sup> Although this is a normal statement of the US administration toward any nation with some significance, it upgraded military-to-military relations with Mongolia from a normal confidence building relation to collaborative one. In other words, for Mongolians, their defense cooperation with the United States brought them one level above other developing nations, who are not in closer alliance type relationship with the Pentagon. Mongolia’s participation in coalition operations increased its need for military training in the United States and other NATO countries and provided provisions of NATO standard equipment in order to improve interoperability of Mongolian small units. The two militaries created several bilateral training events (e.g., Khaan Quest exercise) at the operational and tactical tier in Mongolia besides sponsoring Mongolia’s participation in the regional multilateral training events and exercises such as Cobra Gold, Balikatan, and other US initiatives (i.e., Multinational Planning Augmentation Team, Global Peace Support Operations initiatives).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0095327X12441323">23</xref>
</sup> At the same time, the funding for military education and training as well as the provision of NATO standard equipment were increased substantially from 2003. Later Mongolia becomes the biggest beneficiary of the US peacekeeping capacity building programs (i.e., Enhanced International Peacekeeping Capabilities [EPIC], Global Peace Operations Initiatives [GPOI]) and IMET Program among US non-treaty partners in the Asia Pacific.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0095327X12441323">24</xref>
</sup> The socialization process at the educational tier has been broadened and more training opportunities are extended not only to military personnel but also to civilian experts, who were involved in national security aspects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0095327X12441323">25</xref>
</sup> Increasing its professional military education programs for the Mongolian military demonstrates attitudinal changes in the Pentagon, which regards the Mongolian military as a new partner, who needed to build up its interoperability, especially for peace support operations.</p>
<p>There are several observable changes in the Mongolian military that can be claimed as the result of the military socialization process with the US military and its allies. First, democratic civil–military relations norms have been adopted by Mongolia. A civilian defense minister and the separation of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff were introduced in 1996. Transparency in defense policy and defense budget was gradually adopted by the Mongolian government. The Mongolian military has come under more explicitly institutionalized civilian control. It now operates within a clearly defined legal framework even for domestic missions to support civilian authorities in disaster relief and law enforcement. Second, military reform became more explicitly oriented toward NATO standards and professionalism. The entire new system of the non-commissioned officers was adopted with the assistance of the US Army because earlier the Mongolian military basically consisted of an officer corps and conscripts. Now non-commissioned officers constitute over 50 percent of the total manpower. The non-commissioned officer academy was created in 1993 and it is now run by senior non-commissioned officers from 2006. Senior posts for non-commissioned officers were created at the General Staff and all military units. This type of delegation of authority to non-commissioned officers was unthinkable during the communist period. After its participation in the US and NATO-led coalition operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo, the Mongolia military headquarters adopted NATO staff (G/S) structures in 2008. In these coalition operations, Mongolian military contingents, ranging from staff officers and an infantry platoon to enhanced motorized company of 200 personnel units, were integrated into multinational forces, which consist of mostly NATO members, at tactical and, to a certain extent, operational levels. Since 2003, most field operational and tactical manuals were revised following US examples to increase operational and tactical interoperability with NATO ground forces. Negative Soviet traditions such as hazing and alcoholism were dealt with in more systematic ways. Any incidents involving hazing or alcohol at work or during deployment now result in immediate demotion or even expulsion from the military service. Innovations suggested by junior officers, who trained or operated with NATO militaries, were supported by senior officers. Many of these innovations, such as US Army physical fitness training tests, unit symbols, mission insignia, personnel gear modifications, and drills were formally adopted by the military. These were signs of a disconnect from the Soviet past. Third, ideological compatibility, Russian language skills, and Russian military training are no longer considered as prerequisites for promotion. Political neutrality, foreign language skills with more emphasis on English, military education and training from Western nations, and experience of peace support operations become key merits for career development for both officers and non-commissioned officers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0095327X12441323">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Fourth, the socialization process with the United States and its allies contributed to the consolidation of the Mongolian military’s new identity—a Western-oriented professional military, which is committed to peacekeeping and respects democratic civil–military relations norms. The Mongolian military is gradually becoming a member of the Asia Pacific Region, especially Northeast Asia, distinct from Central Asian states, who are members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and maintain a Soviet military identity. Another impact of US–Mongolian military interaction is that it has enabled Mongolia to develop defense cooperation with the US allies in Asia, notably, South Korea, Japan, some Southeast Asian nations, and other NATO member nations, Germany, Turkey, Belgium, and Canada. But, these increased military interactions with the United States and its allies have upset Russia and more particularly the Chinese military.</p>
<p>The Mongolian military’s main mission has shifted from territorial defense to peacekeeping operations. Although Mongolians have been in control of this nonbinding military socialization process with the United States and its allies, its <italic>self-generated motivation</italic> has enabled it to alter the attitudes of the Pentagon—to see the Mongolian military as a model for other post-authoritarian militaries—and Mongolians to perceive the US military as a model for its military reform. As nicely summed up by US Pacific Commander in his testimony to Congress in 2011, “Mongolia endures as a small but strong partner in Northeast Asia . . . It continues to demonstrate support for U.S. regional and global policy objectives—especially those linked to the Global Peacekeeping Operations Initiative and security operations in Afghanistan—while managing positive relations with its neighbors China and Russia.”<sup>

<title>Military Interactions with the PLA</title>
<p>Sino-Mongolian military interactions are unique and vulnerable to external and domestic factors. Due to Mongolia’s geographic proximity to Chinese northern and central areas, Mongolian military socialization with Russia, United States, and even India<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0095327X12441323">28</xref>
</sup> continues to invoke a feeling of anxiety and vulnerability for Chinese security thinkers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0095327X12441323">29</xref>
</sup> The Soviet Union deployed its military into Mongolia to pressure China in 1960s. Now the US and Indian military engagements with Mongolia trigger similar anxiety and fear in Beijing. Although the larger military presence in Mongolia is impossible, China suspects cooperation in intelligence, special operations, or even the establishment of launch pads in Mongolia against China.</p>
<p>This explains Chinese attempts to keep Mongolia free of any extensive foreign military presence by demanding the withdrawal of the Russian military to normalize Sino-Russia relations, reduction of defense posture by establishing a nonmilitarized border in the 1950s, and the demarcation of the Sino-Mongolia border in 1964. On the other hand, centuries of “China threat” paranoia have limited Sino-Mongolian military interaction. It is likely that if military interactions with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Mongolia increased, this would create similar suspicions for Russian military planners regarding Chinese intentions to dominate the Russian traditional geostrategic buffer. Therefore, Sino-Mongolian military interactions need to maintain a delicate balance and are unlikely to enter into the military socialization processes, which transmit norms, ideas, and values at least in the near future. After two decades of hostility, Mongolia initiated a reestablishment of defense cooperation with China in 1989.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0095327X12441323">30</xref>
</sup> Thus, the Sino-Mongolian military interaction was caused by Mongolia’s <italic>self-generated motivation </italic>to interact with the Chinese military to learn and to build confidence. The PLA responded positively to Mongolia’s request and included Mongolia in its foreign military assistance program in mid-1990s, but it seems that initially the PLA did not have any intentions to deepen its military interactions with Mongolia. However, China has been intensifying its military interactions with Mongolia in response to Mongolia’s increased military interactions with the American, Russian, and Indian militaries since 2003. China started employing persuasion to attract Mongolia’s participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) military events. Mongolia has been reluctant to participate in the SCO military activities by exerting its contrasting interest to join in the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) programs and deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo. This indicates that Mongolia has been in control of its <italic>nonbinding </italic>military interactions with PLA while China continues to employ persuasion to discourage Mongolia’s interactions with its potential adversaries and to encourage it into PRC-lead regional security organizations like the SCO.</p>
<p>Geopolitical sensitivity and signs of growing Chinese influence are noticeable if we examine Sino-Mongolian military interactions at different tiers of socialization. In 1950–1963, the PLA was still a revolutionary army and entangled in Korean War and Sino-Indian Border Conflicts. During this period, Sino-Mongolian military interactions centered on the political and strategic tier, and exchanges of military delegates, military ensemble, athletes, and logistics cooperation were organized to promote confidence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0095327X12441323">31</xref>
</sup> In 1956, Mongolia decommissioned its Border Troops and reduced its military substantially; therefore, there was no need and no resources on either side to engage at the other tiers of military socialization. As defense cooperation was normalized in 1989, high-level exchanges resumed on an annual basis, defense attaché offices were established in respective capitals in 1991, and a bilateral agreement was concluded in 1997. Starting from 1993, when the Mongolian military was suffering from challenges related to the economic transition from a socialist to a free market economy, the provision of assistance to the Mongolian military was often portrayed as an important part of the annual high-level exchanges. Since there were no stricter regulations of using this assistance except its requirement for noncombat purpose, it was favored by the Mongolian military leaders.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0095327X12441323">32</xref>
</sup> So far, the PLA has provided 93 million yuan worth of assistance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0095327X12441323">33</xref>
</sup> The PLA assistance usually came in the form of nonmilitary items such as construction materials, computers, vehicles, and so forth. The latest portion of PLA assistance is devoted to the construction of a recreational facility for Mongolian peacekeepers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0095327X12441323">34</xref>
</sup> Along with these developments at the political and strategic tier, educational tier interactions were started in 1995 as China included Mongolia in its foreign military training programs. As China expanded its military training assistance programs for developing nations, particularly, Central Asia, Mongolian military personnel were invited to join in these training programs. By 2011, 160 military personnel participated in PLA military training assistance programs, which were mostly given in Russian along with other Russian-speaking militaries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0095327X12441323">35</xref>
</sup> Also, Mongolian senior military officers have attended the International Security Symposium, which has been organized by the Chinese National Defense University since 1999.</p>
<p>However, operational and tactical tier interactions were not stressed by either side. Except for a small-scale peacekeeping exercise in 2009, the two militaries have never interacted at this tier.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0095327X12441323">36</xref>
</sup> Although both sides have invited military observers to field training exercises since 2006, it was merely for the purpose of confidence building. Therefore, both militaries are not keen to engage closely at the operational and tactical tier. Foremost, Mongolia’s overall reaction to Chinese-led regional security approaches has been cautious. For instance, marking a deep hole in the SCO map in terms of geographic legitimacy, Mongolia is not a member of the SCO and de-emphasized its participation in the military events of the SCO as an observer. Although Mongolia participates in the US-led counterterrorist operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, it does not endorse Chinese counterterrorist collaboration with Central Asian militaries. Second, language is a clear obstacle for military interactions. While the majority of military personnel speak English and Russian in Mongolian military, Chinese is the less popular. The same may apply to Chinese military; few Han-ethnic military personnel speak Mongolian since China never sends Inner Mongolians to its diplomatic posts in Ulaanbaatar or interactions with Mongolian military. Third, transnational military interaction is also a new aspect of the PLA. However, as its influence in foreign policy increases, it seems more emphasis has been given to the PLA Navy and Air Force, but not ground forces.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0095327X12441323">37</xref>
</sup> Therefore, no real need is seen to increase its interactions with Mongolian military.</p>
<p>Sino-Mongolian military interactions are the most conflicted, and these interactions solely aim to build confidence between two militaries. Although one must recognize impacts of the learning process between political and military leaders as well as military personnel, who participated in training programs and exchanges with the PLA, there is deep-seated distrust and bias in the minds of both militaries. Even if people will gain new information and knowledge, the distrust and bias built on traditional hostility and the present uncertainty of the rising major power need more time to be neutralized. To better understand Chinese military engagements with Mongolia, as Institute for Strategic Studies researcher B. Indra concluded, “it needs to be explained in connection with Chinese sensitiveness towards Mongolia’s military engagements with other major powers (clearly the United States) and Chinese ‘good neighbor policy’.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0095327X12441323">38</xref>
</sup> Even though Mongolia invites Chinese observers and participants in small-scale military exercises in Mongolia, China maintains its suspicions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0095327X12441323">39</xref>
</sup> Sino-Mongolian military interactions are weak at operational and tactical tiers, but continued interactions at the political and strategic tier and educational tier may result in more understanding. UN peacekeeping operations may provide more promising military socialization for both nations either in exercises or deployments. Even though differences in the ideational values of both nations are great, Chinese military assistance (noncombat) may prove an influential tool to impact the minds of military personnel, as it does in many other developing nations. Whether Mongolia joins in Sino-centric regional security institutions like the SCO remains an important process to observe. If Mongolia joins the SCO, the Sino-Mongolian military interactions may shift to closer military socialization to internalize norms of this nascent security community and Mongolia will ease Chinese sensitivity.</p>

<title>Concluding Thoughts</title>
<p>The military socialization process, which is either caused by <italic>self-generated motivations</italic> of the small state or <italic>persuasion</italic> and <italic>coercion</italic> of the major power, may result in the internalization of norms and the redefinition or consolidation of a new identity. In the Mongolian case, its socialization with the Russian military in 1921–1989 inducted Mongolia into the communist bloc security community; Mongolia internalized the communist civil–military norms and consolidated the Soviet-style military identity. On the other hand, Mongolian military socialization with the United States inducted Mongolia into the Asia Pacific security community, internalized norms compatible with democracy and a free market economy, and consolidated the Mongolian military’s new identity, which is different from those of the Russian and Chinese militaries.</p>
<p>The military socialization process is slow when the small state is in charge because it desires to develop its own military capability and meet its unique security needs rather than adopting all the norms, ideas, and values of the major power. Also, the small state’s military interacts with the militaries of the major power only to build confidence and to promote political interactions. The Mongolian military socialization process with the Soviet Union was closer and faster when the Soviets had political will, strategic interest, and resources. In contrast, the Mongolian military socialization process with American military forces has been slower even though Mongolian politicians and military leaders displayed interest and eagerness. The Sino-Mongolian military socialization process presented other interesting dynamics. Their interactions are constrained by traditional mistrust and geostrategic sensitivity.</p>
<p>The military socialization process offers a cross-learning opportunity for participants. Over seventy years of <italic>binding</italic> military socialization with the Soviets created a learning environment for both militaries; thus it enabled the faster militarization of Mongolia in 1966–1989. The personal and professional ties established by Mongolian and Russian military personnel during this period helped to resume the military interactions between the two nations in 2000 after a decade of inactivity. In case of the military cooperation with the United States, suspicions of Mongolian military leaders and American military planners’ perceptions about the Mongolian military were changed into the recognition of partnership after interacting for over a decade. A similar trend is applicable to Mongolia’s interactions with the PLA, but this trend is slow due to deep-seated mistrust, ideational and cultural differences.</p>
<p>The Mongolian case demonstrates that all factors such as the legacy of previous military socialization processes, generational changes, political will and economic capacity of the major power, rivalry among major powers, interests and beliefs of ruling political and military elites, and economic capacity of the small state are in play. Military elites are still favorable to Russian military culture and equipment. The political will and economic capacity of the major powers wax and wane. Rivalry is visible between Russia, who desires not to lose its former ally; China, who does not want a militarized Mongolia; and the United States, who supports its fledgling democracy. Mongolian politicians and military leaders are keen to project the military as a foreign policy instrument and protector of democracy. But limited economic capacity constrains the modernization of its military capability. These factors are easily identified in many other developing nations.</p>
<p>In the military socialization process, generational change is important. A military person, who started socializing with foreign military at the tactical or educational tiers, is likely to be supportive of a military socialization process as he or she reaches posts at the operational and political and strategic tiers. In the Mongolian case, military personnel, who started their military careers in 1990s, have started filling key posts at the Ministry of Defense, General Staff, and Defense University. Also, the earlier generation of military officers, with Soviet military background in 1980s and experience with other foreign militaries through exercises, military training assistance programs, and peacekeeping deployments in past two decades, are now manning senior posts. An incumbent Chief of the General Staff, MG Ts. Byambajav graduated from the Soviet military schools and served as Senior National Representative at the US Central Command. His first deputy is MG B. Bayarmagnai, educated in Mongolia and the United States, and commanded military contingents in both United Nations Peacekeeping Operations (UN PKO) in Sierra Leone and the coalition operation in Iraq. The Director of the Strategic Management and Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, BG D. Bayarsaikhan, graduated from both Russian and the US military schools, commanded a military contingent in Iraq, and served as at the multinational planning team. Today the majority of military personnel at the Ministry of Defense, General Staff, and Defense University have interacted with foreign militaries thorough either exercises, deployments or educational exchanges. These generations with extensive transnational military socialization experience are supportive of greater military interactions and institutionalization of Mongolia’s transnational military socialization in more effective ways.</p>
<p>Out of the three tiers, the interactions at the educational tier, in particular the role of the foreign language at this tier, could be most useful to analyze the socialization process. In the Mongolian case, the Russian language was the mandatory foreign language for all military students until 1993. The most Soviet military textbooks were simply translated into Mongolian and even students in the engineering programs were required to use Russian textbooks during that time. From 1995, the English language became the most popular foreign language at the Defense University. Between 1997 and 2011, 554 people graduated from English language courses (over 60 percent in the intermediate and advanced courses), 415 from the Russian courses, and 116 from the Chinese courses. Although Russian and Chinese language courses started from 2002, the majority of the attendees in Russian and Chinese were in the basic and lower intermediate levels: 55 percent of the Russian courses in the intermediate level and 68 percent of the Chinese courses in the basic level.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0095327X12441323">40</xref>
</sup> This means more people have already received basic and lower intermediate level of the English language while skills of Russian language have waned. Since 1995, there have been 551 Mongolian military personnel that studied in various educational and training programs in foreign countries, where English was the main language of instruction, 615 in Russia, and 239 in China. As mentioned earlier, about 80 percent of people who studied in China used either Russian or English as main tool of learning.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0095327X12441323">41</xref>
</sup> Russian military training assistance started from 2003 and doubled its intake from 2008. The other indicator in this tier is the library holdings in the military education institutions. Until 1994, most military scholarly works were completed in Russian and Mongolian and exclusively based on the Soviet sources. Since then, scholarly works are produced only in Mongolian, and sources were diversified, albeit sources in Mongolian, English, and Russian are prevalent in doctoral works. Today, the integrated defense university library system holds 20,088 holdings in Russian, 3,464 in English, and 192 in Chinese. Over 70 percent of the Russian language holdings were inherited from the communist period.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0095327X12441323">42</xref>
</sup> Although all scholarly works of military science have been produced in Mongolian, English may replace Russian as the language of choice for military science in Mongolia.</p>
<p>Mongolian military socialization with three major powers has offered a unique opportunity for Mongolia to consolidate its own identity and norms, which are different from Russian and Chinese military values, norms, and identity. To highlight this differing culture from their neighbors, the Mongolian military has internalized the Western military values, norms, standards, and at the same time, revived its own military tradition and culture dating back to the Mongolian Empire. Although Russian military influence seems to be reappearing and interactions with the Chinese military are rising, their impacts are insignificant because Mongolia is not in “<italic>binding”</italic> partnership with either party. Therefore, the Mongolian military would certainly consolidate its own unique identity and culture with its own pace and desires in near future.</p>
<p>As this article argues that military socialization is one of the most visible facets of the state socialization process, the study of Mongolian military socialization processes with Russian, American, Chinese, and other militaries tells us that Mongolia is once again on the path into a “great game” of major players. Even though geoeconomic aspects will be the most contentious for Russia, China, and the others, the military socialization angle should not be downplayed. Today China employs increasingly assertive defense diplomacy by offering extensive military training and technical assistance to developing nations, pushing its leadership of security architecture in Central Asia, and becoming a hub for military socialization on the similar footing of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the study of soft side of defense engagements—the military socialization process—provides more contextual understanding to analyze causes, intensity, and dynamics of hardware exchanges through defense engagements.</p>
<p>A three-tiered analytical framework will enable us look at the transnational military socialization processes in depth and to capture their dynamics and impacts on socializing militaries. A careful analysis of military socialization may lead to a better understanding the state-to-state socialization between small, middle, and major powers on comparative scale.</p>

<p>In contrast with Russian or US military assistance, PLA did not place any requirements for its assistance over purpose and usages. It may be explained in two ways. First, the military assistance for Mongolia and Central Asian states are relatively new; therefore, the PLA do not have system in place like in Africa, where PLA have personnel in charge of defense assistance programs. Second, PLA does not want to impose any conditions because all these states were former military buffer of the Soviet Union. Thus, PLA assistance will used to ease anti-Chinese sentiments among military.</p>
