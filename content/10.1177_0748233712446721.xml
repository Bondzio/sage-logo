<p>In this study, the cytogenetic and oxidative effects of water soluble extracts of two commonly eaten insects, <italic>Zonocerus variegatus</italic> (Orthoptera: Pyrgomorphidae) and <italic>Oryctes boas</italic> (Solanales: Solanaceae), in southwestern Nigeria were evaluated on cultured human blood cells. The extracts were added to the cultures at various concentrations (0–2000 ppm). The chromosome aberration and micronucleus tests were used to find out the DNA and chromosomal damage potentials <italic>in vitro</italic> by aqueous insect extracts. To assess the oxidative effects of these insect extracts, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant status (TOS) levels were also measured. Our results indicated that these extracts did not show genotoxic effects at the tested concentrations. However, the extracts caused dose-dependent alterations in both TAC and TOS levels. Based on the findings, it was concluded that the studied insects can be consumed safely, but it is necessary to consider the cellular damages that are likely to appear depending on the oxidative stress. We also suggest that this <italic>in vitro</italic> approach for oxidative and genotoxicity assessments may be useful to compare the potential health risks of edible insects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Insects have been considered as an important food source in different regions of the world like Africa, Australia, Asia and the United States, due to their valuable nutritional contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233712446721">Rams–Elorduy, 1997</xref>). Worldwide, nearly 1700 insect species are reported to be used as human food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233712446721">Ramos-Elorduy, 2008</xref>). In Africa, 524 insect species are consumed as human food in 36 countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233712446721">De Foliart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233712446721">Ramos-Elorduy, 2008</xref>). Similarly, a lot of edible insect species are being used for human consumption in various parts of the Nigeria. For example, over 10 different edible insect species are consumed by the people of Benue state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233712446721">Agbidye et al., 2009</xref>). Peoples from another state, Kwara, have been known to feast on termites, crickets, grasshoppers, caterpillars, palm weevil larvae and compost beetle larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233712446721">Bug Food, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233712446721">Fasoranti and Aji Boye, 1993</xref>). Groups of the palm weevil, <italic>Rhynchophorus phoenicis</italic> Fabr. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), are fried and eaten (locally known as Ogongo) in several parts of western Nigeria and in Delta and Edo states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233712446721">Banjo et al., 2006</xref>). The adult variegated grasshopper (locally known as Tata) <italic>Zonocerus variegatus</italic> Linn. (Orthoptera: Pyrgomorphidae) has a large dry season population in southwestern Nigeria is reported to be eaten in the Akoko area of Ondo state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233712446721">Fasoranti and Ajiboye, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233712446721">Adeduntan and Bada (2004</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233712446721">Ashiru (1988</xref>) also reported the consumption of the African silkworm, <italic>Anephe</italic>, by the rural dwellers in Ondo state. These reports indicate that various edible insect species are widely used for human consumption in Nigeria. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233712446721">Banjo et al.

<p>On the other hand, edible insects constitute a very common and important food source in many developing countries, although these insects may contain vertebrate toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233712446721">Akinnawo et al., 2002</xref>). So eating these insects may cause serious harmful effects on humans. At this context, the potential toxic effects of these popular edible insects need further investigation. This research will also serve to improve the pharmaceuticals because it is well known that the animal toxins may become important in curing diseases like cancer. The genotoxic damage potentials of edible insect extracts have not yet been reported except for a very few studies. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233712446721">Incekara and Turkez (2009</xref>), three aquatic edible insect species, <italic>Hydrophilus piceus </italic>Linnaeus, 1758 (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae), <italic>Dytiscus marginalis </italic>Linnaeus, 1758 (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) and <italic>Cybister </italic>sp., (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) were evaluated and found to be nongenotoxic. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233712446721">Incekara et al. (2010</xref>), the <italic>in vitro </italic>genetic and oxidative effects of different <italic>Callimenus latipes </italic>Stal, 1875 (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae: Bradyporinae) extracts (acetone, ethanol and diethyl ether) on human lymphocytes were investigated. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233712446721">Turkez et al. (2010a</xref>), the genotoxic potentials of water soluble extracts of grasshoppers, <italic>Saga ephippigera ephippigera </italic>Fischer de Waldheim, 1846 and <italic>C. dilatatus </italic>Stal, 1876 (Orthoptera) on cultured human blood cells were evaluated and found to be nongenotoxic. Again, recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233712446721">Turkez et al. (2011</xref>) reported nonmutagenic properties of migratory locust (<italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> L.) on cultured human blood cells using the chromosomal aberration (CA) and micronucleus (MN) tests <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>Although insects are widely consumed all over the world, as it is seen from the literatures above, very limited information is available concerning their toxic effects. To our best knowledge, no study has been carried out on <italic>Z. variegatus </italic>and<italic> O. boas</italic> toxicity. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to assess the genotoxic and oxidative effects of <italic>Z. variegatus</italic> (Orthoptera: Pyrgomorphidae) and <italic>O. boas</italic> (Solanales: Solanaceae) by CA and MN tests in human whole blood cultures treated with different concentrations of water soluble extracts for the first time. Genetic alterations, mainly CAs and formations of MN in cell cytoplasm, are the early biological effects of mutagenesis and/or carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233712446721">Hagmar et al., 1998</xref>). In fact, the analysis of CAs is also assumed to be a sensitive method capable of detecting changes in the cell genome of the living organism caused by the environmental mutagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233712446721">Baatout and Derradji, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233712446721">Turkez and Aydin, 2011</xref>). The cytokinesis-blocked MN test also offers the advantage of providing simultaneous information on both the cell cycle progression and chromosomal/genomic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233712446721">Kirsch-Volders et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233712446721">Turkez et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233712446721">Turkez and Geyikoğlu, 2007</xref>). The important oxidative parameters including total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant status (TOS) are used to monitor the development and extent of damage due to oxidative stress by insects in human blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233712446721">Turkez and Toğar, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Insect extracts</title>
<p>Two commonly eaten insect samples, <italic>Z. variegatus</italic> and <italic>O. boas</italic>, were collected from its natural habitats in southwestern Nigeria and killed without any chemical treatment. The aqueous extracts of <italic>Z. variegatus</italic> and <italic>O. boas</italic> were added to the cultures. A stock solution of aqueous extract was prepared by mixing 1 g of dried insect powder with 1000 mL of water (boiled and cooled tap water) with constant stirring on a magnetic stirrer. The suspension of dried insect powder in water was left for 4 h, filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper and the filtrate was stored in amber colored air tight bottle at room temperature till use. Then, stock solutions were diluted and added to cell culture tubes. The final extract concentrations were 0, 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, 75, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm.</p>

<sec id="section4-0748233712446721">
<title>Cell cultures</title>
<p>The heparinized blood samples from five healthy male nonsmoking donors with no history of exposure to any toxic agent were used in our experiments. From all volunteers involved in this study, hematological and biochemical parameters were analyzed and no pathology was detected. Human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures were set up according to a slight modification of the protocol described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233712446721">Evans and O’Riordan (1975</xref>). A 0.5-mL aliquot of heparinized blood was cultured in 6 mL of culture medium (Chromosome Medium B; Biochrom, Berlin) with 5 mg/mL of phytohemagglutinin (Biochrom). The cultures were incubated in complete darkness for 72 h at 37°C. Experiments were conform to the guidelines of the World Medical Assembly (Declaration of Helsinki). Both the CA and MN tests were carried out on lymphocytes 72 h after the treatment. The TAC and TOS assays were carried out on plasma samples 2 h after the treatment. Each individual lymphocyte culture without insect extract was studied as a control group. Mitomycin C (10<sup>−7</sup> M) was used as the positive control in CA and MN assays. Similarly, ascorbic acid (10 µM) and hydrogen peroxide (25 µM) were also used as positive controls in TAC and TOS analysis, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0748233712446721">
<title>MN assay</title>
<p>The MN test was performed by adding cytochalasin B (Sigma; final concentration 6 mg/mL) after 44 h of culture. At the end of the 72-h incubation period, the lymphocytes were fixed with ice-cold methanol/acetic acid (1:1, v/v). The fixed cells were put directly on slides using a cytospin and stained with Giemsa solution. All slides were coded before scoring. The criteria for scoring micronuclei were as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233712446721">Fenech (1993</xref>). At least 1000 binucleated lymphocytes were examined per concentration for the presence of one, two or more micronuclei.</p>

<sec id="section6-0748233712446721">
<title>CA assay</title>
<p>For the analysis of structural chromosomal aberrations (chromatid or chromosome gap and chromatid or chromosome break), cultures were carried out for 72 h. Two hours prior to harvesting, 0.1 mL of colchicine (0.2 μg/mL) was added to the culture tube. To prepare the slides, three to five drops of the fixed cell suspension were dropped on a clean slide and air-dried. The slides were the stained with 3% Giemsa solution in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 15 min. Twenty well-spread metaphases were analyzed for each concentration to detect the presence of chromosomal aberrations. Criteria to classify the different types of aberrations were in accordance with the recommendation of Environmental Health Criteria (EHC) 46 for environmental monitoring of human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233712446721">IPCS, 1985</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-0748233712446721">
<title>TAC and TOS analysis</title>
<p>The automated Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TAC) and TOS assays were carried out in plasma samples obtained from blood cultures for 2 h by commercially available kits (Rel Assay Diagnostics<sup>®</sup>, Turkey) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233712446721">Erel, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233712446721">Turkez and Togar, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 13.0, SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). The Duncan’s test was used to determine whether any treatment has significantly differed from controls or each other. Statistical decisions were made with a significance level of 0.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results of the present study clearly indicated that the aqueous extracts of <italic>Z. variegatus</italic> and <italic>O. boas </italic>did not alter MN/1000 cell frequencies in cultured human lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748233712446721">Figure 4</xref>). The mean ± SD of the individual rates of CA values in treated and untreated groups is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748233712446721">Figure 5</xref>. The water soluble extracts of <italic>Z. variegatus</italic> and <italic>O. boas</italic> did not cause any statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) increase in CA rates depending upon the number of concentrations tested. Nevertheless, the human blood cultures were found to be sterile after the application of the extracts of <italic>Z. variegatus</italic> and <italic>O. boas</italic> at the concentrations of 2000 and 1000 ppm, respectively. The cytotoxic effects that were observed at increasing concentrations might cause the sterility.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The uses of many insect species as an important food source have become so widespread in many parts of the world. Therefore, the consumption of nontoxic insects should be encouraged. Although edible insects have become so widespread in the world, very limited information is available in the literature concerning with their genotoxic and oxidative effects. A very little number of edible insect species were tested for their genotoxic potentials by sister chromatid exchange assay on human whole blood cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233712446721">Incekara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233712446721">Incekara and Turkez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233712446721">Turkez et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233712446721">2011</xref>). In these studies, no <italic>in vitro </italic>adverse effects could be demonstrated and was revealed that some edible insect species have no mutagenic potential. Our present results clearly indicated that water extracts of <italic>Z. variegatus </italic>and<italic> O. boas </italic>have no mutagenic potential. Basic toxicity information often provides a valuable perspective for predicting the potential risk to humans. As a matter of fact, it was reported that identification and subsequent lowering of exposure to genotoxic agents would remain one of the main goals for primary cancer prevention in man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233712446721">Bartsch and Malaveille, 1989</xref>). According to the results of the present study, it is suggested that these insect species can be consumed safely; however, it will also be useful to take into consideration the cytotoxicity at increasing doses. The safe concentrations of edible insect extracts in human blood as prescribed here are valid only for <italic>in vitro </italic>conditions. In order to generalize this suggestion, further <italic>in vivo </italic>studies are required on the absorption kinetics of these extracts from the gastrointestinal track into blood.</p>
<p>The results of the present study revealed that <italic>Z. variegatus</italic> (at 10, 15, 25 and 40 ppm) and<italic> O. boas</italic> (at 10, 15 and 25 ppm) extract caused significant increases in the levels of TAC <italic>in vitro</italic>. The results of this study may be, at least in part, attributed to vitamins A, B<sub>2</sub> and C contents of the mentioned insect species. In fact, it has been found that vitamin A, besides previously recognized functions of preventing particular lipido- and avitaminosis, significantly participate in the protection of the human body against oxidation stress that is characterized by balance disturbance between speed of free radical creation and reactive oxygen forms with pace of their neutralization by enzymes and antioxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233712446721">Rutkowski et al., 2010</xref>). Vitamin C was reported to be together with glutathione, a major representative of the nonenzymatic antioxidant system in the water soluble compartment. Vitamin B<sub>2</sub> was found to be acted mainly as a cofactor of glutathione reductase, which keeps glutathione in the reduced state. Therefore, it can be considered an indirect antioxidative vitamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233712446721">Böhles, 1997</xref>). The relationships between strong antioxidant defenses and the contents of minerals such as Ca, Mg, Fe and P were also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233712446721">Kharb and Singh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233712446721">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>). Our results of the present study also revealed that aqueous extracts of <italic>O.boas</italic> and <italic>Z. vareigatus</italic> caused a decrease in the levels of TAC, at higher concentrations than at 1000 and 500 ppm. Both the extracts caused increase in oxidative stress at the concentrations higher than these concentrations. The cytotoxic effects of overdose application of insect extracts could be explained by the increases in TOS levels. Similar to vegetables, the insect extracts are suggested as an important source of nutritional factors and may also provide vitamins and minerals that exert additional beneficial effects on health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233712446721">Park et al., 2011</xref>). Based on the present findings, it was concluded that the studied insects can be consumed safely, but it is necessary to consider the cellular damages that are likely to appear depending on the oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, insects are not used as emergency food to ward off starvation, but are included as a normal part of the diet throughout the year or when seasonally available. Eating insects have become more popular day by day around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233712446721">Memorial University, 2010</xref>), and therefore, further investigations on the potential genotoxic effects of these popular edible insects should be conducted. In promoting insects as human food, relative genotoxic potentials should be taken into consideration to provide the maximum benefit to human consumers. We also offer that this <italic>in vitro </italic>approach, which includes the collaborative use of two genetic endpoints such as CA and MN tests, will serve to compare the potential health risks of edible insects related to mutagenesis or carcinogenesis.</p>
