<p>Throughout history, religion and science have had a dueling relationship in the social, economic, and political arenas. This contentious relationship has found itself at the center of the debate on how to structure drug addiction treatment programs. It has been commonly assumed that religion and science offer different approaches for addiction treatment. Daniel E. Hood tries to dispel the common belief that there are meaningful differences between religious- and scientific-based addiction treatment programs, in <italic>Redemption and Recovery</italic> (henceforth R&amp;R). It is the second volume of an ethnographic study that compares the successes and failures of two addiction treatment programs. Reading R&amp;R first, before reading <italic>Addiction Treatment: Comparing Religion and Science in Application (Volume One)</italic>, was a challenge given that crucial information from Volume One was needed to understand the nuances of the overall argument made in Volume Two. Moreover, reading R&amp;R was also challenging given the thick nature of the ethnographic analysis. But the juxtaposition of two different addiction treatment philosophies, one based on science and the other based on religion, rewards the reader with a critical analysis of the similarities of the two programs, despite the rhetorical differences.</p>
<p>In the first part of R&amp;R, Hood provides the reader with an ethno-demographic analysis of the clientele at Redemption House (i.e., religion-based paradigm) and Recovery House (i.e., science-based paradigm). Using a contextualized demographic analysis, Hood argues that clients at both houses have four common characteristics: (1) race and ethnicity, (2) occupational status, (3) family background, and (4) drug-use history. However, despite these similarities, Hood maintains that there is no single profile of what causes drug addiction, and there is no single social or psychological profile that can be used to describe drug users. The contextualized demographic analysis provides the reader with a rich array of information, at the same time serving as a constant reminder not to use reductionist tendencies and try to fit these clients into a generalized statistical model.</p>
<p>Hood begins his analysis with the premise that the untrained observer will conclude the Redemption House and Recovery House are in fact, different addiction treatment paradigms. He uses Chapters Two to Four as a springboard to jump into his analysis of the similarities of the two addiction treatment paradigms. Through his ethnographic research, he arrived at a controversial conclusion: the only difference between religious-based and science-based addiction treatment paradigms was the rhetoric and rationale used to support each respective paradigm. For example, both paradigms stressed social and ideological control in an effort to have clients believe in the <italic>Higher Power</italic> of spirituality in their “radical conversion” to a life without drugs. This example shows how the analysis of the intersection of drugs and religion provides a unique lens to understand the similarities in the programs and outcomes, despite the rhetorical device that is used to market differences between science- and religion-based paradigms for addiction treatment.</p>
<p>In Chapter Five, Hood pivots his analysis of similar addiction treatments and focuses his analysis on the process of reentry for clients. Again Hood points to similarities in the two houses to prepare clients for life without drugs. The anchor for both houses is ideological survival (i.e., just say no to drugs). Hood argues that more is needed in terms of skills (beyond ideology) if clients are to survive in the world outside the treatment center. According to Hood, no positivist research can predict, with any kind of certainty, why some drug users succeed and live a life of normalcy and why others fail. The one unifying denominator that successful clients have in common is that they undergo different types of treatments and training services several times. This finding underscores the fact that going through training one time has a low probability of leading to success. In the end, Hood argues that successful reentry depends on time in program, maturity of the individual, and age.</p>
<p>In the final analytical chapter, Hood compares the successes and failures of the two houses. This is perhaps the most confusing, challenging, and least convincing chapter presented in this volume. Hood begins with the premise that since religious- and science-based addiction treatment programs are essentially the same program, then both houses should have the same success rate. No surprise—he concludes that both houses have essentially the same success rate. Despite the rhetorical device used to justify the comparison and conclusion, the success rates were different. The success rate for Recovery House was 15 percent and the success rate for Redemption House was 13 percent. It is possible that these rates were statistically similar; however, Hood made no effort to test this difference, but passed off the success rates to the reader as if they were identical. Moreover, if readers try to look underneath the “hood” to see what is going on with these calculations, they will be surprised to find that the data are not comparable, unless a series of assumptions and extrapolations are made. Unfortunately, Hood’s premise is still a premise.</p>
<p>Despite R&amp;R’s shortcomings in Chapter Five, Hood’s overall analysis of similarities between religious-based and science-based addiction treatment and training programs offers readers a sophisticated and nuanced analysis of the life of a drug user and the obstacles that must be overcome to live a life of normalcy. In a shrewd way, Hood was able to use this comparison to underscore how science-based addiction treatment programs incorporate religious ideas to foster an environment that is conducive to social and ideological control. As he astutely points out, if researchers want to study how religion is used in addiction treatment, the Recovery House is a better place to study than the Redemption House.</p>
