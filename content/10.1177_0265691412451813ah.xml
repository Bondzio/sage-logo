<p>Vaizey has produced a well-researched and interesting book on family life in Germany, which covers the wartime period and the immediate post-war years. In particular, she examines the impact of the war upon family relationships and analyses how men, women and children experienced wartime separation and subsequent peacetime reunion. Her work builds on previous contributions to this subject, including my book, <italic>Nazi Family Policy, 1933–1945</italic> and Mouton’s <italic>From Nurturing the Nation to Purifying the Volk</italic>. Vaizey’s aim is to examine the impact of the Nazi regime on ‘intra-familial relationships’.</p>
<p>Vaizey speaks of the ‘extraordinary resilience of the nuclear family and the emotional ties that bound its members together’ in Nazi Germany (2). She begins with a discussion of family life under Nazism before the wartime period. She shows how the NSDAP aimed to undermine family loyalty and intervene in the private realm, as well as assessing the extent to which people’s actions betrayed their level of commitment to the regime. Vaizey moves on to a discussion of the wartime period. She examines the ways in which family members communicated with each other during periods of lengthy separation, using ego-documents such as letters and diaries to find out how families stayed in touch. Letters helped to bridge the gap of enforced separation in wartime. Of course, it was in the interests of the Nazi regime to maintain popular morale and so it did facilitate letter exchanges, although this process was subjected to heavy censorship. Vaizey maintains that despite the obstacles that confronted family members, they did maintain communication, which was ‘crucial to family cohesion’ (61). She argues that even if emotional intensity in letters was not necessarily to be replicated in person, couples which communicated by letter ‘had good reason to feel optimistic and committed to working on their marriage post-reunion’ (59).</p>
<p>Vaizey investigates the emotional circumstances faced by married couples separated by war. Did the wartime realities strengthen or weaken bonds within marriages? Spouses worried about how their loved ones were faring under the conditions of the war. Women feared for the lives of their husbands on the front; men were concerned about how their wives were managing at home without them, especially as they faced food shortages and air raids. Long periods of separation and scanty communication inevitably meant that some husbands and wives questioned each other’s fidelity or were unfaithful. Others were looking forward to a time when they could be together again. Wartime letters show how couples were able to keep their relationships alive and give us an insight into the private world of their marriages. Whilst many letters were nostalgic about the past and painted a rosy picture of the future, Vaizey shows that some couples were very realistic about their situation. ‘As people learned to cope with less, they adjusted their outlooks accordingly’ (92). However, this does not necessarily imply that the chaos of war and dislocation encouraged cohesion between couples, as Vaizey argues.</p>
<p>The penultimate chapter examines the question of continuity and change in gender roles from the pre-war to the post-war period. It considers the extent to which women were empowered by their wartime experiences. Without their men, women had to make decisions and engage in all sorts of different types of work and activities than they had previously. How did their independence impact upon their subsequent reunions with their husbands? The concept of women ‘standing alone’ on the Home Front during the war and the ‘Hour of the Woman’ after the war, meant a new situation for married couples once men returned from the front. Despite the prevalent image in the historical literature of strong women, who dealt with the realities of war and subsequently cleared up the rubble, many women did feel vulnerable or were physically exhausted by the strains of life. Vaizey argues that ultimately they ‘wanted to return to a sense of normality’ (109). In the end, she maintains, changes in gender roles engendered by the circumstances of the war were not permanent ones, and that power dynamics between spouses adjusted back to how they were previously.</p>
<p>The last chapter analyses the impact of the war on the relationships between parents and children. Vaizey examines ‘motherhood on the home front’ and ‘fatherhood from afar’. Many children grew up without the presence of their father for several years. To what extent did this erode the traditional patriarchal model of the family? Moreover, she examines the different types of family reunions. In the end, she states, ‘there can be no definitive answers to the question of how the relationships between parents and children were affected by World War Two and its aftermath’, as variations were very great ‘from one family to another’ (148). Vaizey’s book is an important contribution to historical literature on this subject.</p>
