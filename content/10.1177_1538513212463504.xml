<p>Suzanne Frank did an excellent job with the “Harlem and the 1967 ‘New City’ Exhibition” article (vol. 11:3).</p>
<p>There are the two places where I would correct the MIT, particularly Bob Goodman, references.</p>
<p>On p. 216, she says MIT hired Goodman to determine “what residents of East Harlem would want.” Goodman was hired before there was any notion of the “New City;” none of us received any directives from MIT.</p>
<p>On p. 217, she rightly sees Goodman as the team member engaged in advocacy planning, but suggests that the MIT design was in the hands of Goodman who in turn was under the influence of Maurice Smith. The MIT design was a collective effort, including students. All participants except Goodman had significant relations with Smith. Additionally, Smith would want to assure us that the MIT project does not reflect his thought.</p>
