<sec id="sec20-1744987112455422"><title>Introduction:</title><p>Teen pregnancy in Hispanic youth is a poorly understood phenomenon with numerous and overlapping sociocultural influences. Hispanics have had the highest teen pregnancy rates in the United States since 1995 and pregnancy rates that have declined much more slowly when compared to every other ethnic group. Literature investigating long-term Hispanic youth of the United States and the factors influencing their decision-making processes and sexual behaviours is limited.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec21-1744987112455422"><title>Purpose:</title><p>This study aimed to explore and describe attitudes and behaviours related to teen pregnancy and parenting in Hispanic female teens from long-term families in New Mexico, whose primary language was English and who have experienced pregnancy and motherhood in the 12 months prior to participation.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec22-1744987112455422"><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a focused-ethnographic qualitative study conducted in areas of New Mexico with high rates of teen pregnancy and where the population is majority Hispanic with long-term residency. Data were collected in interviews with 10 adolescent mothers and 10 adults, and through participant observation. Data were analysed inductively through immersion and crystallisation.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec23-1744987112455422"><title>Results:</title><p>Key findings of the study include chaos/instability characterising the homes of youth, low levels of communication related to reproductive issues, disappointment expressed by families and community in response to teen pregnancy and community goals for the future.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec24-1744987112455422"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The study results will aid in increasing the knowledge base related to long-term Hispanic youth and the many sociocultural factors affecting their sexual decisions and behaviours.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec1-1744987112455422" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Teen pregnancy is a complex issue with far-reaching and burdensome consequences, affecting disproportionate numbers of Hispanic youth in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112455422">Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI), 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987112455422">Kost and Henshaw, 2012</xref>) and in New Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987112455422">National Center for Health Statistics, 2010</xref>; National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987112455422">NCPTUP), 2010a</xref>). Teen motherhood is often viewed negatively because of its strong associations with academic failure, poverty, welfare dependence, and domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987112455422">New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH), 2005</xref>). The U.S. has the highest rates of teen pregnancy in the entire industrialised world (42.2/1,000 girls aged 15–19 years) with around 750,000 teenagers becoming pregnant annually. Hispanics residing in the U.S. have had the highest teen birth rates since 1995 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1744987112455422">The State Center for Health Statistics/Office of New Mexico Vital Records and Health, 2007</xref>) with more than 51% of Hispanic females becoming pregnant at least once before they reach the age of 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987112455422">National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy (NCPTP), 2006</xref>). In 2006, New Mexico had the second highest teen birth rate in the nation with 4,688 pregnancies occurring to teen mothers; 3,188 were to Hispanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1744987112455422">The State Center for Health Statistics/Office of New Mexico Vital Records and Health, 2008</xref>). Hispanics are the largest ethnic minority in the U.S., with projected population growth patterns indicating that by 2025, approximately one quarter of all U.S. adolescents will be Hispanic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987112455422">NCPTP, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987112455422">NCPTUP, 2010b</xref>). If teen pregnancy rates continue at their present trends, it is anticipated that the absolute numbers of pregnancies and subsequent births to Hispanic teens will increase further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987112455422">Kirby, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987112455422">NCPTUP, 2010b</xref>). Long-term Hispanics (those with multigenerational familial residence) comprise large groups of Hispanics across the Southwest. Scientific literature using long-term Hispanic samples are largely absent.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the attitudes and behaviours related to teen pregnancy in parenting long-term Hispanic female teens and was guided by three research questions: (a) what are the attitudes and behaviours of long-term Hispanic teen females regarding sex, contraception, adolescent pregnancy, and parenthood?; (b) what cultural and social influences guide the behaviour and belief systems of long-term Hispanic teen females, in regards to sex, contraceptive use, adolescent pregnancy, and adolescent parenting?; and (c) what are the attitudes of adult Hispanics regarding teen sexuality and reproduction?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987112455422" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Focused ethnography, a qualitative research approach, serves as a method of inquiry to acquire detailed information on the socially created and complex interwoven behaviours and meanings of a group (Agar, 1980; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1744987112455422">Wolcott, 1999</xref>). Using a small number of people can provide in-depth information and understandings on the particular issue of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987112455422">Patton, 2002</xref>); in this case, the sexual behaviours and attitudes of long-term Hispanic adolescent females of New Mexico.</p>
<p>After securing approval from the Institutional Review Board of a major southwestern university, participants were recruited and comprised two distinct groups. Primary participants: these were 10 mothering teens aged 15–17 years, of Hispanic ethnicity who were parenting children less than one year old and had at least three degrees of familial residence in New Mexico. Secondary participants: these were 10 adults, 18 years or older, born and raised in New Mexico, who worked/interacted with Hispanic youth and had valuable insight into the culture where the primary participants live. Primary participants were recruited through referrals from known community contacts, such as local nurse midwives, high school staff, paediatric health providers, and staff of Women Infant Children nutritional programmes. Referrals were of teens who met the inclusion criteria and who were willing to discuss their experiences. Teens also self-referred based upon word-of-mouth contact with enrolled teens, and were based upon inclusion criteria. Secondary participants were recruited from known contacts and through referrals from other enrolled primary and secondary participants. In focused ethnography, a number of individuals who have the key characteristics, knowledge, or experience of interest are recruited and enrolled in the study to maximise the chance that the data will be rich and informative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987112455422">Higginbottom, 2004</xref>). Participants of this study were recruited until the data were redundant and the themes were saturated.</p>
<p>Prior to data collection, informed consent (including parental/guardian consent and teen assent) was obtained. Interviews were guided by a loosely structured format allowing the participants’ stories to lead the discussion. Interviews began with a 'grand tour' question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987112455422">Siegle, 2002</xref>) to define the area under inquiry and encourage detailed discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987112455422">Brown, 1999</xref>). Following was more specific questioning to help obtain in-depth information about salient elements of the participants’ attitudes and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987112455422">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987112455422">Siegle, 2002</xref>). Topics covered in the interviews included: participant’s upbringing and current attitudes/beliefs about contraception, sex, and pregnancy; teens’ experiences with pregnancy and parenting; and, community views on teen pregnancy. The details revealed through probing and clarifying questions identified specific areas of importance in each of the participants’ stories. After offering the participant’s a choice of interview location, between the investigator’s office and a confidential area of their school, all interviews were held at the office of the investigator, where the participant’s children could play with provided toys and where privacy was secured. All interviews lasted between one and three hours.</p>
<p>Immediately following each interview, the audiotapes were reviewed and the investigators’ preliminary impressions, observations, and thoughts were noted. Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim and participants were assigned aliases to protect their identities. Transcripts were then dimensionalised with salient verbal and nonverbal elements, such as smiling, crying, silences, or other nonverbal cues not captured on the transcripts.</p>
<p>Participant observations were conducted in the community of interest to help the researcher see the world as the participant sees it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987112455422">Fossey et al., 2002</xref>). Observations capture people’s routines, interactions, and practices, which are unspoken and naturally occurring in their social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987112455422">Kottak, 2005</xref>). Observations assist the investigator in understanding the differences between what people say and what they do, thus prompting further questions for subsequent interviews and informing emerging themes while adding to the richness and complexity of the information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987112455422">Crabtree and Miller, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Data were analysed through the process of immersion and crystallisation, a comprehensive and prolonged iterative, contemplative, and reflexive process that led to the emergence of ideas and themes that are insightful and interpretative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987112455422">Borkan, 1999</xref>). A line-by line review of the data followed to verify that the findings were contextual and data-driven and accounted for the key concepts and discordance in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987112455422">Mendelson, 2003</xref>). Additional reviews and discussion of the data occurred between the first and second and third authors which led to the development of refined thematic findings. The repetitive nature of analysis, by individual and group discussions and between reading and reflection of the data and interpretation development allowed firm links to be made that were supported through participant’s comments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1744987112455422">Roberts, 2006</xref>) and ensured similarities and differences across the sample was derived through a rigorous process.</p>

And so my grandpa had to get them … I looked at my parents and I didn’t see the good side of drugs. I saw everything that made it horrible.

<sec id="sec4-1744987112455422"><title>Chaotic/unstable homes</title>
<p>Social influences affecting the attitudes and beliefs of the primary participants included difficult and fragmented home environments where teens engaged with others in their families, shared beliefs and attitudes, and where they were currently raising their own children. The participants described being raised by family members other than their parents, from early childhood. Parents were often not involved in the care of their teens either by choice or because the children had been removed from their care due to substance/other abuse issues. Teens’ parents were not viewed as important in the teen’s life, as role models, or credible sources of guidance as they were physically and emotionally unavailable to the teens.</p>
<p>Several participants described their homes as unsupportive; a place one was allowed to stay if the adult chose to have you. Some recalled being kicked out of their homes after fighting with their family members and at least one had spent time on the streets during her pregnancy. Despite the chaos, primary participants voiced a desire to not hurt/insult their families by repeated pregnancies and instead to better themselves and provide more stable environments for their own child.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987112455422"><title>Communication</title>
<p>Primary participants reported limited communication related to sex and contraception within their families, schools and with their sexual partners. Roberta describes this simply as: ‘Like you just know, no one really tells you' (line 289) and captured participants’ embarrassment, discomfort and a general avoidance of discussing anything sexual, in their homes and schools.</p>
<p>Rare discussions with sexual partners focused on continuation of the relationship should they conceive and parental responsibilities, as they viewed them. Most participants described some comfort with incorrect/inconsistent use of contraceptives, as they had been reassured their boyfriend would remain in the relationship. This indicates that the participants had basic knowledge/understanding that unprotected sex could lead to pregnancy.</p>
<p>Although many participants described discomfort with limited sexual communication, they had not found a means to negotiate a change in this area. Secondary participants added that limited reproductive communication had been longstanding in the communities and negatively influenced youth; they did not agree with the social restrictions placed on this topic and desired changes towards more clear and open discussions. Although they predicted that this shift would likely not occur in the individual homes, they strongly desired comprehensive sexual education undertaken and owned by the schools in hopes that youth would be fully prepared to make more educated and healthy choices for themselves in areas involving relationships, self-esteem, future goals, and sex.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987112455422"><title>Disappointment</title>
<p>Disappointment was a theme induced through the primary participants’ shared fearful experiences of telling their families of the pregnancy and disappointment and anger expressed by the families in response: discussions which occurred behind closed doors where only members of the biological family were present. Despite their fear, primary participants expressed a duty to their unborn child to fight for their life and refuse abortions, which were sometimes advised by their parents/guardians and boyfriends.</p>
<p>Secondary participants recalled incidences where they observed families who were extremely upset by their teen’s pregnancy, who grieved for the lost dreams they once held for their teen daughters, and who were embarrassed over the current pregnancy. Incidences were recalled where families were viewed forcing themselves to publicly exhibit happiness related to the pregnancy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987112455422"><title>Futures</title>
<p>This theme captured the participants’ wishes to stop the cycle of teen pregnancy in their communities. Based upon their experiences, secondary participants predicted poor futures for teen parents who were likely to have low education and income levels, broken romantic relationships, and repeated teen pregnancies; beliefs driving their desires for community change. Primary participants felt that teen pregnancy should be prevented as it was too hard to be a teen and a parent. They desired more open and consistent communication from adults beginning in early childhood and planned to have this type of relationship with their children.</p>
<p>The participants also advise that community efforts cannot stop in supporting futures of teen parents. Here, secondary participants viewed teens as independent decision-makers who chose unprotected sexual activity/ pregnancy at a young age and should therefore accept the inherent accountability which parenting entails if they desired the support of the community. Primary participants described the need for ongoing support in their day-to-day lives. However, support, here is viewed as an entitlement of being a teen parent and an expectation from adults who are seen as more capable and obligated in providing what is needed.</p>
<p>Pregnancy prevention, as described by secondary participants, should be inclusive of comprehensive reproductive education and access to preventative services offered by and the responsibility of the schools. In these areas, where poverty is overwhelming and even basic transportation a luxury, the school is where youth are present and prepared for their futures, including academic knowledge, social skills, and education and services for responsible reproduction.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1744987112455422"><title>Chaotic and unstable homes</title>
<p>It is well documented that positive relationships with one’s parents and community is associated with risk reduction in regards to sexual behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987112455422">Nadeem et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1744987112455422">Talashek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1744987112455422">Velez-Pastrana et al., 2005</xref>); a premise many interventional programmes aimed at reducing teen pregnancy and targeting Hispanic populations are often based upon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987112455422">NCPTP, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987112455422">NCPTUP, 2010c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1744987112455422">Talashek et al., 2004</xref>). In stark contrast to the characterisation of Hispanics in the literature where core values of family unity/closeness (Familismo), respect/politeness (Respeto), and a general importance placed on honesty and social relationships (Personalismo) govern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987112455422">NCPTUP, 2010c</xref>), the primary participants in the current study describe homes of their childhood as chaotic and unstable. Homes are accepted as environments where youth engage with others and begin sharing beliefs and developing attitudes. The primary participant’s households, however, were unsupportive, wrought with abuse issues and parental absentia. These findings appear to be unique to the literature related to Hispanic youth and not described previously.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic factors also play a role in risk level and although Hispanics come from all socioeconomic classes, they tend to suffer disproportionately from poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112455422">AGI, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987112455422">Driscoll et al., 2001</xref>), a factor that is considered risk promotive for teen pregnancy, but cannot fully account for all risk in studied samples (Berry et al., 2000; Santelli et al., 2000). Statistical data support the characterisation of homes in the current study as impoverished and suffering with violence and drug use (The State Center for Health Statistics/Office of New Mexico Vital Records and Health Statistics, 2008) where youth survive but do not thrive. Instead of placing the answer to teen pregnancy prevention on presupposed Hispanic cultural values and norms, interventions based upon careful consideration of the socioeconomic demographics and the unique characteristics of each population may be effective in positively influencing community relationships and norms, thereby reducing the cycle of teen pregnancy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1744987112455422"><title>Communication</title>
<p>Communication between parents and children is sometimes used as a measure of quality in family relationships and is seen as a function of the overall home environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987112455422">Driscoll et al., 2001</xref>) with high levels of communication and information-sharing risk protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112455422">Aspy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987112455422">NCPTUP, 2010c</xref>). Although some studies have found initiation of sexual communication in Hispanic homes, frequency of discussions were not sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987112455422">Campero et al., 2010</xref>). Latinas have been found to be unlikely to discuss sex with their daughters and report high levels of discomfort with communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987112455422">Meneses et al., 2006</xref>); discussion topics mostly relate to morals and consequences of sex but not contraception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987112455422">Guilamo-Ramos et al., 2006</xref>) with mothers describing culture as not conducive to open communication about sex and experiencing embarrassment and discomfort when in discussions with their youth. Discomfort and embarrassment are important barriers to effective parent-youth communication as youth describe a need to feel that adults are credible, trustworthy and accessible in their knowledge if they are to effectively internalise the provided information received from parents to affect behaviour changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987112455422">Guilamo-Ramos et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Many primary participants in the current study had some awareness of contraception and risks of unprotected intercourse, yet continued to state desires for increased education. Based upon this dichotomous report, it seems that what is requested is not purely education, but instead closer/more supportive relationships within their families and/or with reliable, trustworthy and credible adults; findings supportive of positive communication as a proxy for familial connectivity. The participants’ willingness to change towards more positive relationships indicates a prime opportunity to capture the interest of teen parents and adults and institute the beginnings of societal changes towards increasing family cohesiveness and subsequent communication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1744987112455422"><title>Disappointment</title>
<p>The literature describes Hispanic culture as that which strongly values motherhood as an end in itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987112455422">NCPTUP, 2010a</xref>) and where academic and career achievements are less supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987112455422">Driscoll et al., 2001</xref>). Hispanic homes are described as not sanctioning early and unprotected sexual activity, but celebrating and supporting teen pregnancy when it does occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987112455422">Holleran and Waller, 2007</xref>). Contrary to this view, the primary participants described anger and disappointment, expressed by their families in response to their pregnancies.</p>
<p>Primary participants also cited poor personal preparation for motherhood and limited support from their families and community which contradicts the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1744987112455422">Williams and Vines (1999)</xref> that teen pregnancy is a means of obtaining positive emotional support from one’s family and teen motherhood as a rite of passage into adulthood with the independence and associated respect from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987112455422">Montgomery, 2002</xref>). Secondary participants described broad social attitudes regarding teen pregnancy as disappointing yet there also existed an on-stage/off-stage dynamic, where attempts were made to socially correct the families’ embarrassment by portraying the situation publicly as joyful while chastising the teens in private. This environment may be inconducive to open discussions of any hardships or regret related to teen pregnancy/parenting and may present barriers to honest and supportive communication with youth who may wish to receive services for prevention of future pregnancy or promotion of education/career achievements outside of pregnancy/parenting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1744987112455422"><title>Futures</title>
<p>In impoverished surroundings where academic and employment opportunities are limited, it is felt that motherhood becomes a viable and rational career choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744987112455422">Rich and Kim, 2002</xref>) given the alternatives and limited life options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744987112455422">Smithbattle, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1744987112455422">Wiemann et al. (2005</xref>: 352) suggest that Hispanics regard motherhood as an 'essential requisite' for achieving adulthood and Hispanic families strongly support teen parents: a view unsupported in the current study where secondary participants describe teen pregnancy as disappointing and support issued only when earned by the teen parents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744987112455422">Smithbattle (2000)</xref> acknowledges that for many disadvantaged teens, pregnancy may be that which epitomises the aspiration of escaping a grim past for a future that may hold opportunities for teens to reorganise their lives towards becoming more responsible, mature, and empowered. However, the few primary participants in the current study that did choose to conceive reportedly did so to escape unsupportive and/or abusive homes, not as a means of gaining respect, support, or as a career.</p>
<p>However, in a model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987112455422">Merrick (1995)</xref> and accepted in the current study, career choice does not necessarily suggest employment and financial success but may convey a role which serves to define oneself and one’s life’s work. The primary participants’ descriptions of pregnancy/parenting as a positive life change illustrates a defining experience in the teen’s lives and one which now allowed them a career choice; to self-identify as mothers and women. Despite their desires to better themselves though education/careers and become role models for their children, they unanimously lacked positive role models in their homes, attended school sporadically after becoming parents, and were seen struggling to undo the script that had previously been written where poor academics, poverty and repeated cycles of abuse and pregnancy dominated; a description supported by the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987112455422">Mcbride and Gienapp, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987112455422">NCPTP, 2007</xref>). It therefore seems that the current study’s primary participants’ perception of parenting, although allowing them self-identification, was somewhat incongruent with the likelihood of successful futures.</p>
<p>In summary, the three research questions were answered by participants informing the social and economic influences shaping the environments of youth in the current study. The self-perpetuating cycle of disconnected families with repeated teen pregnancy is likely to continue unless such communities are given the social capital and public resources that they require to promote strengths they possess and rewrite norms to protect and nurture their children’s well-being and careers outside of teen parenting. Instead of societal victim-blaming of teens that become pregnant and scapegoating by teens who accuse society for their mistakes, establishing connections for communication between families, schools and the larger community are important to allow careers beyond motherhood.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1744987112455422"><title>Strengths, limitations, and implications</title>
<sec id="sec14-1744987112455422"><title>Strengths</title>
<p>Strengths of this study include rigour, based upon prolonged engagement in the communities of interest, persistent observations including systematic observations that were made throughout the entire data collection period, triangulation of data sources, member checks, dependability and confirmability of the data. Sufficient time and persistent and systematic observations were made in the communities of interest and in the study process for misconceptions to be explored and data to be validated. Over two years was spent on data collection and one year on analysis. Four triangulated data sources, including interviews with primary and secondary participants, observations, demographic information and field notes, promoted completeness in the data and offered several views of the phenomenon of interest. Credibility of the data through member checks was undertaken with systematic interviews that included summarising and validating data with primary and secondary participants throughout the data collection period. Participant interviews included member-checking by soliciting information regarding both validation and/or clarification on the emerging data. The findings were presented in a rich and detailed manner that allows consumers of this research to determine transferability of the study to their populations of interest. Authenticity and accuracy of the data were an ongoing part of this research and maintained through field notes and engagement in peer audits and debriefings with experienced nurse researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1744987112455422"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>Limitations of this study include homogeneity in the sample with no male participants and limited second interviews with primary participants. Although this study focused on the perspectives and experiences of teen mothers and therefore only sampled female teens as primary participants, male participants may have provided different perspectives on the issue under study.</p>
<p>All primary participants had initially assented to participate in second interviews, towards individual member checking of the data; eight of the 10 participants did not return for second interviews due to lack of transportation, disconnected telephone numbers and/or relocated residence. These difficulties may not be seen as unusual when considering the chaotic and unstable homes of youth in this study and their dependence upon others for transportation and livelihood. Member checking did occur in interviews with all participants on emerging themes and provided broad opinions on the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1744987112455422"><title>Implications</title>
<p>It is our intent that the results of this study not be generalised to the entire Hispanic or adolescent populations, but instead add to the knowledge base related to Hispanic youth and the many factors that influence their sexual decisions and behaviours at the practice and research levels. Transferability of the findings is to be determined by each consumer of this research.</p>
<p>The primary participants in this study all faced numerous barriers to successful futures. They struggled with understanding what it was to parent and successfully fulfil this role; a role that was largely unsupported in their families, by their partners and in their communities. Families were described as disconnected, and unsupported in communities that struggled under poverty and closed communication. Through their experiences with difficulties of pregnancy and parenting, the participants planned to avoid repeated pregnancies in their youth and offered advice for other teens to do the same. Despite these hopes, the epidemic of teen pregnancy continues and is especially problematic for Hispanic youth. The participant’s desire for change and to increase communication about sexual health is significant as without assistance and support, the likelihood that participants will affect this change to stop the repeated cycles of teen pregnancy is unlikely. Community nurses can engage populations of youth and interested adults and support their willingness to alter behaviours towards increased education levels regarding reproduction and contraception, as well as basic parenting skills that include child development, healthy parenting, and open, connected and supported homes. Youth are most present in schools and easily accessible by school nurses and school based health centres where family planning, education and contraceptive supplies could be made easily accessible. Work with families and school staff to encourage recurring and accurate information sharing with youth and by credible and trustworthy adults, regarding topics of sexual development and reproduction may also be driven by community nurses acting as advocates for the vulnerable populations of Hispanic youth.</p>
<p>Improving access to and knowledge of reproductive health and its connection to social issues such as poverty and poor education depends on community programmes that acknowledge and are sensitive to the unique social, geographic and economic forces that influence the youth of today and the parents of tomorrow. The situation is ripe for coalitions, inclusive of community and school nurses and staff, families, and nurse practitioners to engage and work with teen parents, families and communities in targeted outreach. Promotion of social capital and sexual health of future generations in a culturally knowledgeable and sensitive manner through improving access to healthcare and educational systems is critical.</p>
<p>Recommendations for nursing research involves exploration of Hispanic reproductive, contraceptive, and teen pregnancy issues at community, family and individual levels. We propose that qualitative research which serves to explore and understand is needed at this stage of scientific inquiry. Truly listening to and connecting with participants while comprehending their issues related to teen pregnancy is crucial in order to continue the work of describing the intricacies of this complex phenomenon.</p>
<p>Research focusing on the community-level must explore broad attitudes on sexuality, including beliefs and values regarding communication, connectivity and social norms. Research should include aims to understand each community’s unique environmental influences, their strengths and social networks that shape beliefs and practices and resulting teen behaviours. Exploration of factors that encourage positive health outcomes and resiliency of its members should be identified so that the strengths of such communities can be capitalised upon with each and every intervention focusing on teen pregnancy prevention. Research into community support of school-based sexual education for youth is critical information to obtain and share with policymakers, educators and nurse advocates.</p>
<p>The relationships between family and children and their communication patterns appear very important in shaping the attitudes and sexual behaviours of teens. Family environments in the current study were described as fearful, embarrassing, difficult and stressful which promotes continued cycles of substance abuse, absent parents and teen pregnancy; all of which affect youth negatively. Therefore, research focused on understanding specific relationships, connectivity, expectations, communication patterns and topics, and practices of parents/guardians is a logical next step. Without insight into the underlying intricate household issues, support of healthy families may not occur effectively.</p>
<p>Research to explore individual attitudes, beliefs, and norms, including research of teen males as half of the sexual dyad and adolescent peers, should be undertaken. Understanding adult and teen males’ attitudes and behaviours on contraception, pregnancy and parenting and the social norms that drive these behaviours and attitudes is critical. Investigating the roles of peers in shaping attitudes towards sex and their impact on normative behaviours is also important. Heterogeneity of samples would add diversity of view points and provide for maximal variation in the data while also allowing for opportunities to test theoretical assumptions.</p>
<p>Most important of all the recommendations is a call for all nurses to role model positive behaviours of effective communication and advocacy that is sensitive to the beliefs, values, health practices and environments of all teens. Nurses are in a key position not only to provide culturally appropriate care but also to educate, role model and advocate for public awareness and open debate regarding reproductive health issues in underserved youth: addressing issues such as those identified in this study. Nurse researchers may effectively advocate for the health of Hispanic youth by promoting a rise in the priority level of research on Hispanic health issues on state and federal health agendas. Nurse researchers may also encourage collaborations within the Hispanic research community as well as between the community and a larger group of nurse researchers that may serve to support research proposals, new research ideas and dissemination of existing data to fill gaps in the knowledge base.</p>
