<abstract>
<p>Our knowledge of the role of plaintiff gender in shaping the judicial decision to issue restraining orders rests upon only two studies. Both conclude that judges discriminate against male victims. Each is constrained by small male sample size, few control variables, and limited statistical analysis. We replicate one of these studies. In the issuance of temporary orders we find a gender difference, though with a greatly reduced effect size compared to the earlier study. Legally relevant gender differences may explain this disparity. Plaintiff gender had no effect on the judicial decision to set hearing dates or to issue a permanent order.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>After several decades of dispute, the “gender symmetry” issue remains one of the most enduring controversies in the social sciences. While considerable agreement exists that male violence is more severe and more likely to result in physical injury than female violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801213490558">Straus, 2008</xref>), a large chasm continues to divide contending parties. Family violence theorists point to a substantial body of data supporting the claim that the prevalence of female intimate partner violence (IPV) equals, or exceeds, female victimization by male partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801213490558">Archer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801213490558">Straus, 2008</xref>). Studies supporting this position rely heavily on data derived from variants of the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) as employed with national probability samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801213490558">Gelles &amp; Straus, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Feminist theorists challenge this view and cite national surveys that show higher rates of female victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801213490558">Catalano, Smith, Snyder, &amp; Rand, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801213490558">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>). Equally important, these critics point to the CTS (and other measurement tools) as counting only acts at the expense of context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801213490558">Cook &amp; Goodman, 2006</xref>). In this perspective, violence perpetrated by men against women is viewed as more severe in meaning and consequence, even when the physical act may be objectively similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801213490558">Brusch, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801213490558">Melton &amp; Belknap, 2003</xref>). Male aggression is seen as motivated by the desire to dominate and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801213490558">Belknap &amp; Melton, 2005</xref>), whereas female aggression is viewed as primarily defensive in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801213490558">Melton &amp; Belknap, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801213490558">Saunders, 1986</xref>), a point that is not conceded by family violence theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801213490558">Straus, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These contending perspectives also shape views of effective intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801213490558">Smith &amp; McCollum, 2011</xref>). Those who view intimate violence as symmetrical and arising from family dynamics believe that couple counseling should be one option in a repertoire of choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801213490558">Straus, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801213490558">2011</xref>). Those who see intimate violence as primarily an attempt by men to control women believe cocounseling erroneously implies coresponsibility for violent acts. Consequently, intervention should be confined to counseling male aggressors. This latter viewpoint is generally regarded as the most influential perspective shaping the design of the majority of batterer intervention programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801213490558">Price &amp; Rosenbaum, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These differences in perspective extend to allegations of gender discrimination in the allocation of societal resources to address and contain the problem of intimate violence. Theorists of the family violence/gender symmetry viewpoint argue that violent victimization of men by women is devalued by society and reflected in a paucity of support services available to male victims of female aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490558">Basile, 2005</xref>). Among these services, civil restraining orders have come to be regarded as a particularly important expression of societal concern for victims, performing both a symbolic and protective function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801213490558">Buzawa, Buzawa, &amp; Stark, 2011</xref>). Their significance to intimate violence victims is suggested by a national survey finding that 17.1% of female victims and 3.5% of male victims obtained a restraining order against their assailant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801213490558">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In view of their importance, it is surprising that civil restraining orders have rarely been analyzed in the larger context of the criminal justice research literature that addresses the influence of gender on court decision-making. The case for making this linkage is clear. Family violence theorists who believe that IPV is symmetrical argue that judges discriminate against male plaintiffs in civil proceedings for reasons based upon gender stereotypes of female aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490558">Basile, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller, Desmarais, &amp; Hamel, 2009</xref>). The literature on gender discrimination in the criminal courts has addressed the influence of exactly the same stereotypes on official decision-making. Theoretical developments in the understanding of the role of gender in the domain of the criminal courts should therefore be a fruitful basis for approaching the same issue in the sphere of the civil courts.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section3-1077801213490558">
<title>The Role of Gender in Criminal Court Decision-Making</title>
<p>In response to a wealth of empirical studies, our understanding of the role of gender in criminal court decision-making has undergone a transformation over the past several decades. Broadly, three hypotheses have emerged to account for observations of gender disparities seeming to favor female offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801213490558">Belknap, 2007</xref>). Initially, such “leniency” was interpreted as indicative of “chivalry” or “paternalism” on the part of male decision-makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801213490558">Moulds, 1978</xref>). Though these concepts are nuanced in different ways, each relies upon stereotypes that “imply weakness and a need to protect another person or group” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801213490558">Belknap, 2007</xref>, p. 150). A second school of thought argues that the “evil woman” will lose the “leniency” benefit when engaging in behaviors incompatible with traditional gender role expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801213490558">Erez, 1992</xref>). For example, in the context of intimate violence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801213490558">Osthoff (2001)</xref> suggests that, “If the woman on trial does not match the image of a good battered woman (if she drinks, uses drugs, or is aggressive in any way) the jury is not likely to be sympathetic” (p. 236). Finally, research relying on statistical regression techniques has consistently established that when controls for prior record and offense severity are introduced, the relationship between gender and criminal court outcomes diminishes dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801213490558">Belknap, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801213490558">Daly &amp; Bordt, 1995</xref>). This conclusion also applies to those studies that have specifically addressed the role of suspect gender in court decision-making in cases involving IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801213490558">Kingsnorth &amp; MacIntosh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801213490558">Worrall, Ross, &amp; McCord, 2006</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest more “equal treatment” of male and female offenders than was previously supposed.</p>
<p>Even when gender disparity persists after controls for offense severity and prior record have been imposed, it is far from clear that this necessarily reflects gender discrimination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801213490558">Steffensmeier, Kramer, and Streifel (1993)</xref>, for example, argued based upon interviews with judges that male and female offenders vary in their “blameworthiness” and that “an overall pattern of more lenient outcomes for women may still be defined as warranted and ought not necessarily be construed as gender ‘bias’” (p. 439). In the same vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801213490558">Daly (1994)</xref>, based upon a “deep sample” analysis, proposes a family justice model of decision-making that casts decision-makers not as protectors of women so much as protectors of family structure and functioning. In sum, statistical findings of continuing gender disparity are no longer taken as necessarily indicative of gender discrimination.</p>
<p>All of the studies cited above have been conducted in the context of criminal court decision-making to the neglect of civil procedures, such as applications for restraining orders (civil restraining orders [CRO]). Generalizations from the criminal court literature are of uncertain validity given that criminal procedures involve the state seeking punishment of a criminal defendant, whereas civil procedures involve one private individual seeking protection from another. On one hand, one could hypothesize that male victims seeking protection orders against female aggressors will be devalued by judges, who see female aggression as a less serious threat to society. This perception could lead to a “paternalistic” response to female offenders resulting in a lower rate of issuance of restraining orders for male plaintiffs. On the other hand, the allegation by males of female aggression might be seen as a gender role departure for women, thus inviting the “evil woman” hypothesis, suggesting that more protection orders, not fewer, would be issued to male plaintiffs seeking to control female aggression. The “equal treatment” hypothesis suggests that controlling for the severity of the alleged violence and prior incidents should render perpetrator gender insignificant in the issuance of such orders. Which of these theoretical viewpoints has the greatest validity in the context of CRO can only be resolved by empirical examination.</p>

<title>Civil Restraining Orders and Court Decision-Making</title>
<p>Reflecting their importance to victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801213490558">Buzawa et al., 2011</xref>), civil restraining orders have been extensively studied from a variety of viewpoints. Areas of enquiry have included such issues as: male and female modes of framing their victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801213490558">Durfee, 2011</xref>); motivations for victim noncompletion of the protective order process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801213490558">Roberts, Wolfer, &amp; Mele, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801213490558">Zoellner et al., 2000</xref>); rates of violation of protective orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801213490558">Kanuha &amp; Ross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801213490558">Logan &amp; Walker, 2010</xref>); factors associated with order violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801213490558">Etter &amp; Birzer, 2007</xref>); perceived effectiveness of the orders by petitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801213490558">Logan &amp; Walker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801213490558">Logan, Walker, Shannon, &amp; Cole, 2008</xref>); and attitudes of law enforcement officers toward civil orders and their enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801213490558">Rigakos, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of such extensive attention to CROs, a literature search reveals that analyses of the role of plaintiff gender in the decision to grant or deny CROs is grounded in only two studies that have confronted this issue as their primary concern. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490558">Basile (2005)</xref> notes, “research that examines court response to male requests for protection or that compares court response to male vs. female requests is virtually non-existent” (p. 171). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> state, in refererence to the Basile study, “To date, we know of only one researcher who has addressed this question” (p. 628). In a comprehensive discussion of CROs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801213490558">Buzawa et al. (2011)</xref> were able (at the time of going to press) to identify only the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490558">Basile (2005)</xref> study as having addressed this issue, which they describe as “worthy of continued exploration” (p. 288). Our own literature search confirms these conclusions.</p>
<p>Neither <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490558">Basile (2005)</xref> nor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> place their analyses in the context of the theoretical literature discussing gender and criminal court decision-making summarized above. Both conclude, however, that judges, based upon gender stereotypes, respond more leniently to allegations of female, compared to male, aggression. In other words, judges, in these studies, are less likely to issue orders restraining the behavior of female offenders than male offenders. Their findings and discussion, therefore, are most compatible with the “chivalry/paternalistic” hypothesis.</p>
<p>Since these studies concur with each other in their findings and conclusions and also represent the totality of the literature centered on this subject, we analyze each in detail.</p>

<sec id="section5-1077801213490558">
<title>Two Studies</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490558">Basile (2005)</xref> analyzed a total population of 282 restraining order requests processed through the district court of Gardner, Massachusetts in a single year. The study site is a small town of 20,125 inhabitants of whom 95.8% are White, 1.6% African American, 2.2% Hispanic, and 1.2% Asian. Since the female filing rate was approximately 5 times greater than that of males, the data set contains 44 male and 238 female plaintiffs. Basile’s data analysis relies on 2 × 2 contingency tables when assessing the effect of gender, cohabitation, and parenting status on the decision to grant or deny restraining orders. Basile reports that female plaintiffs are more likely than male plaintiffs to receive a temporary order (91% vs. 66%; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). When analyzing the issuance of a permanent order, Basile correctly removes from the analysis those cases in which the plaintiff failed to appear or requested the petition be dropped (30.9% of cases), since these do not involve a discretionary judicial decision. Thirty-one male petitioners and 164 female petitioners remained for analysis. As with temporary orders, Basile found that males were less likely to receive a permanent order (94% vs. 71%; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and concluded that “male victims of domestic violence were not afforded the same protections as their female counterparts” (p. 178). To address this inequality, he recommended that, “Domestic violence advocates and court officials should receive training on female initiated violence” (p. 179). The demographic characteristics of the study site, small male sample size, and limited statistical analysis all suggest caution in generalizing Basile’s conclusions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> examined the influence of gender on the issuance of civil restraining orders in Sacramento County, California. This study is the object of the present replication.</p>
<p>In our view, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> study suffers from multiple limitations which, taken together, seriously compromise their conclusions. These are: small sample size with a resulting loss of statistical power, the use of only one control variable, limited and misleading statistical analysis, failure to examine all important outcome variables, failure to remove cases that do not require a judicial decision from the PRO (Permanent Restraining Orders) analysis, and a premature assumption that gender disparity equals gender discrimination without discussion of alternative possible explanations. We address each of these in turn.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> study relies on a simple random sample of 157 applications for CRO to test the hypothesis that plaintiff gender influences the granting or denial of both temporary (TRO) and permanent (PRO) orders. Paralleling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490558">Basile’s (2005)</xref> finding and, consistent with the national data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801213490558">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>), female victims in Sacramento County file such applications at approximately five times the rate of males. Consequently, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> sample contains 131 female (83.6%), but only 26 male plaintiffs (16.4%).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> report that 88.0% of all TRO (Temporary Restraining Orders) requests were granted by the court. The study also found that males received TROs in 57.7% of their requests compared to 94.6% of female submissions (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077801213490558">1</xref></sup> Contrary to almost all studies that have relied on court statistics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801213490558">Kingsnorth &amp; MacIntosh, 2007</xref>), male and female plaintiffs were equally likely to have experienced the most severe forms of violence. When controlling for violence severity—the only control variable in the study—the authors report that the observed discrimination against male plaintiffs in the issuance of temporary orders is statistically significant only at low (i.e., not moderate or severe) levels of violence. The overall finding of gender discrimination at this decision-making level consequently relies upon only 12 cases involving male plaintiffs in the low severity category where 25.0% (<italic>N</italic> = 3) of male plaintiffs—compared to 91.2% (<italic>N</italic> = 52) of female plaintiffs—received a TRO.</p>
<p>From a logit model containing only plaintiff gender as the independent variable, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> concluded that “judges were almost 13 times more likely to grant a TRO requested by a female plaintiff against her male intimate partner, than a TRO requested by a male plaintiff against his female partner” (p. 625). This confuses the meaning of odds ratios with probabilities. An OR of 13 does not mean that females are 13 times “more likely” to receive an order than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801213490558">Demaris, 1995</xref>), only that the odds are 13 times greater. The correct calculation is the risk ratio which, employing the data quoted above, reveals that female plaintiffs are 1.64 times as likely as male plaintiffs to be granted the requested order (94.6/57.7). In addition, the OR of 13 is highly imprecise (reflecting the small sample size), as indicated by the confidence interval (not reported) which ranges from 4.3 to 38.3.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077801213490558">2</xref></sup> Moreover, a logistic regression analysis under these conditions (one binary independent variable) provides the identical significance level and odds ratio as can be obtained by a 2 × 2 cross-tabulation. The analysis, therefore, is not substantially advanced by the use of logistic regression.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> confine their analysis to the issuance of TROs and PROs. As we noted in our summary of procedures section, the denial of a temporary order does not preclude the issuance of a permanent order since judges can, and do, issue PRO hearing dates to plaintiffs denied a temporary order. Failure to consider this outcome overlooks the possibility that judges may differentially (by gender) extend this further opportunity to acquire a restraining order.</p>
<p>In contrast to temporary orders, no significant overall gender effect disadvantageous to male victims was found in the issuance of permanent orders (16.0% vs. 31%) but, like temporary orders, was found to be present at the low severity level (0% vs. 42.9%; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490558">Basile (2005)</xref> however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> do not remove from their analysis of permanent orders those cases that were “dismissed,” even though such cases are not eligible for a permanent order and thus do not involve a discretionary judicial decision. Only cases in which the outcome was not yet determined (<italic>N</italic> = 18) were removed from their sample, leaving 138 cases available for analysis of permanent orders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077801213490558">3</xref></sup> None of the low severity cases involving male petitioners were removed for this (or any other) reason. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> therefore rely upon the same 12 male plaintiff cases in the low violence severity level category as were employed in the TRO analysis, even though they note elsewhere (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077801213490558">Table 4</xref>, p. 633) that 5 of these cases were “dismissed” for the reasons stated above and therefore were not eligible for a PRO.</p>
<p>In addition to case dismissal, there are a number of other possible reasons why a case should be removed from an analysis of permanent restraining order decision-making: for example, cases that were denied a TRO and not granted a PRO hearing date, cases where notification of the hearing order date was not provided to the respondent and the TRO was reissued, and cases that have been “consolidated” with another family law case. As we shall demonstrate, when all ineligible cases are removed from their analysis, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> data support a conclusion contrary to the one they advance.</p>
<p>Finally, noting that only 26% of male plaintiffs who applied for a temporary order ultimately received a permanent order, the authors concluded that it is “not very” likely that male victim petitions will result in such orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. 2009</xref>, p. 633). Since a substantial proportion of the remaining petitioners did not receive a permanent order for reasons related to their own behavior (e.g., failure to appear), this statistic is not meaningful in the context of an assessment of judicial decision-making.</p>
<p>Interpreting the observed gender differences in TRO and PRO outcomes as a reflection of gender discrimination in judicial behavior, the authors offer three hypotheses in explanation. They propose that judges may subscribe to the gender patriarchy assumption that only women are victims of intimate violence, or that judges are concerned with negative publicity if the case later results in further violence against the female petitioner, or that judges are fearful of criticism from feminist victim’s rights groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> conclude that judges in Sacramento County deny equal protection of the law to male victims of female aggression in the issuance of both temporary and permanent protective orders. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490558">Basile (2005)</xref>, they propose that judges receive “education regarding the prevalence, nature, and consequences of female aggression” (p. 635). As we have noted above, it is well established in criminal justice research that disparity does not necessarily reflect discrimination, and that before adopting such a conclusion all other hypotheses should first be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801213490558">Nellis, Greene, &amp; Mauer, 2010</xref>). In the present case, this includes the possibility of legally relevant differences between male and female petitions that could explain gender disparity, but which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> do not acknowledge or discuss.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the present study is to replicate that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref>, while utilizing the same source documents in the same jurisdiction in order to test the validity of their conclusions. A second objective is to assess the theoretical relevance of the three hypotheses previously summarized (“chivalry/paternalism,” “evil woman,” and “equal treatment”). In this way, we link the analysis of civil procedures to the more extensive literature from the criminal courts on the relationship between gender and case processing outcomes.</p>

<title>Civil Restraining Orders and Court Procedures</title>
<p>Requests for Temporary and Permanent Restraining Orders tend to follow a similar procedural pattern regardless of jurisdiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801213490558">Buzawa et al., 2011</xref>). Procedures in Sacramento County, therefore, can be assumed to be quite typical. Plaintiffs seeking a restraining order must first complete an application package requiring them to provide information that will serve as the basis for a judicial determination to grant or deny a temporary order (TRO). Among other items, this includes demographic information about the alleged perpetrator, the nature of the relationship between victim and perpetrator, and a description of the most recent and prior threats or acts of abuse.</p>
<p>The judicial decision to issue a TRO is made exclusively on the basis of the written application in an ex parte proceeding at which neither the plaintiff nor the person to be restrained is in attendance. Within 24 hr a judgment is rendered, and if a temporary order is issued, the judge simultaneously schedules a PRO hearing date for 21 days later to determine whether the TRO should be extended permanently (i.e., for a period of 3-5 years). Plaintiffs denied a TRO may nonetheless be granted a PRO hearing date at which they will have an opportunity to argue for a permanent order. The purpose of the 3-week delay is to allow time for notification of the hearing date to be provided to the person to be restrained, since that individual has a right to attend and participate at the hearing. Failure to serve the order precludes a decision at the scheduled hearing and may result in reissuance of the TRO until such service has been accomplished. Plaintiffs are informed in writing that failure to appear at the PRO hearing will automatically result in dismissal of the case. In this county, one judge is assigned the responsibility for presiding over all CRO requests with other judges assuming the role as needed.</p>

<title>Site Demographics</title>
<p>Sacramento County contains a diverse population of 1,400,949 inhabitants of whom 51.4% are White, 9.8% African American, 18.0% Hispanic, and 20.8% whom we have classified as “other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801213490558">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). This latter category is composed of East, South, and West Asians in addition to Native Americans and Pacific Islanders. Since there is little evidence to demonstrate these groups share cultural characteristics in common, and no single group is sufficient in number for reliable commentary, we direct our analysis primarily to the other three groups. Females constitute 50.8% of the Sacramento County population and males 49.2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801213490558">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-1077801213490558">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>With the assistance of court personnel, a stratified random sample of 310 restraining order requests drawn from monthly filings between April, 2009 and March, 2010 was selected. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref>, the sample is confined to heterosexual couples involved in an intimate relationship. Since the selection strategy involved stratification by gender this means that an equal number (<italic>N</italic> = 155) of male and female plaintiffs are included in the sample.</p>
<p>In addition to plaintiff gender, control variables include race/ethnicity and age of the alleged perpetrator, though unfortunately court documents do not provide these data for the plaintiff. Also included are the relationship and living arrangement of perpetrator and victim, whether the parties were coparents, if protection was sought for a child, previous acts of abuse, whether the parties previously lived together, if police arrived at the scene, time (days) from abuse to restraining order request, and severity of violence. With respect to the latter variable we followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al.’s (2009)</xref> categorization and definitions of violence severity as low/moderate/high. (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1077801213490558">Appendix A</xref> for coding categories and values.) Three outcome variables are analyzed to assess the role of gender in court decision-making. First, we examine whether a TRO was granted or denied in all 310 cases. Second, since denial does not preclude the judge from setting a PRO hearing date, we then analyze this decision using the full sample. Third, after removing those cases where no discretionary judicial decision was rendered, we assess the role of gender in shaping whether or not a PRO was granted.</p>
<p>We concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490558">Basile (2005)</xref> that cases not eligible for a permanent order should be excluded from the analysis of judicial decision-making at this final stage. Specifically, we have removed from the analysis of permanent orders those cases in which: the judge denied a TRO and declined to set a PRO hearing date (31); the case was dismissed because the petitioner failed to appear (128); the petitioner appeared and requested the case be dropped (21); the case was consolidated with another ongoing case (17); the judge left the TRO in place and deferred a decision on the PRO (7). In total, 204 cases (65.8%) were removed from the analysis of the issuance of PROs, leaving 106 cases (58 female petitioners and 48 male petitioners) available for an assessment of the role of gender in shaping this decision.</p>

<sec id="section10-1077801213490558">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Our quantitative analysis includes logistic regression modeling for the decision to grant or deny a temporary order. Since odds ratios are not intuitive, we have also converted these ratios to probability differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801213490558">Steffensmeier, Ulmer, &amp; Kramer, 1998</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077801213490558">4</xref></sup> The multicollinearity diagnostics indicate that none of the variables in the model exceeds a VIF of 1.7, which is well below the 2.5 cutoff proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801213490558">Allison (1999)</xref> for elimination.</p>
<p>Logistic regression (LR) was not feasible for the granting of PRO hearing dates since this is duplicative of the TRO decision when that order is issued, and instances of denial of a TRO and granting of a hearing date are too few (<italic>N</italic> = 20) to permit LR analysis. Nor was regression analysis of the permanent order decision feasible since the rate of denial (11.7%) among those cases that were eligible (<italic>N</italic> = 106) was also very low.</p>
<p>Finally, we are conscious of admonitions in the research literature that statistical disparities may conceal nuanced decision-making that can only be revealed by the inclusion of qualitative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801213490558">Daly, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801213490558">Steffensmeier et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, a number of authorities have called for a more inclusive “mixed methods” approach to criminal justice system research that combines both qualitative and quantitative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801213490558">Brent &amp; Kraska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801213490558">Pratt, 2010</xref>). While the primary data analysis technique adopted in this study is quantitative, these cautionary remarks led us to supplement the quantitative data with qualitative materials. Plaintiff written descriptions of abuse were recorded in all cases where a TRO or PRO was denied, along with the reasons stated by the judge for denial where available. Commencing with new forms issued by the California Judicial Council on January 1, 2010, judges are now required to indicate the reason for their judgment in all cases involving denial of TROs. Prior to that date such indications were a matter of judicial discretion and data are not available in every case. The record is complete for all cases processed after January 1, 2010. Judicial explanations are available for all cases involving denial of permanent orders regardless of date.</p>

<p>Among the control variables, female plaintiffs are more likely to request an order that includes protection of a child. Important differences can also be observed in the race/ethnicity data. The biasing effect of oversampling male plaintiffs means that the data in Column 3 cannot be generalized to the total population of CRO perpetrators and then compared to the overall representation of racial/ethnic groups in Sacramento County. We can perform this comparison, however, for male and female perpetrators separately. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801213490558">Table 1</xref> indicates that White males and those described as “other” are underrepresented as perpetrators (.38 and .07, respectively) relative to their representation in the county population (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1077801213490558">Appendix B</xref>). On the other hand, African American males (.30) are three times more likely than would be expected, and Hispanic males are also substantially overrepresented (.25) among those against whom such orders are filed. A different pattern emerges for male plaintiffs with Hispanic females and those described as “other” underrepresented among perpetrators (.12 and .11, respectively). Conversely, African American females (.22) are more than twice as likely to be named in such petitions as would be expected from their representation in the county population. White females (.55) are slightly overrepresented. Finally, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801213490558">Table 1</xref> indicates that female plaintiffs are more than twice as likely as male plaintiffs to be the recipients of the most severe forms of violence (14.2% vs. 6.5%; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02).</p>
<p>Though not shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801213490558">Table 1</xref>, we nonetheless draw attention to the fact that the judge assigned to preside over all CROs handled 87.7% (<italic>N</italic> = 272) of all TRO cases with six additional judges accounting for the balance (<italic>N</italic> = 37).

<p>All the variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801213490558">Table 2</xref> are binary and therefore can be compared for their respective influence on the dependent variable. As indicated by the regression coefficients, level of violence bears the strongest relationship to the likelihood of receiving a TRO, increasing the odds more than sevenfold. Stated in terms of probability, victims experiencing the more severe forms of violence are 37.9% more likely to receive a restraining order than those who experience less severe violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077801213490558">7</xref></sup> The coefficients indicate the remaining three variables to be approximately equal in influence (though differing in direction). Plaintiff gender (female) more than doubles the odds (2.45) of receiving a TRO, while marital status and reporting delay both reduce the odds of receiving a TRO by more than half.</p>
<p>While the difference between male and female plaintiffs is statistically significant when controlling for other variables, the possibility of legally relevant differences between these groups must be considered before embracing the discrimination hypothesis. For a random subset of the total sample (<italic>N</italic> = 117; female = 59, male = 58), we counted the number of words used by male and female plaintiffs when describing the abuse that precipitated the request for a TRO.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077801213490558">8</xref></sup> Female plaintiffs, on average, employed 74.0 words to describe their victimization compared to only 42.9 words by male plaintiffs, and this difference attains high statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). This measure is admittedly a crude simplification, but it suggests the possibility that female plaintiffs may provide more detailed descriptions of their victimization than male plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Judges denied a TRO in 36 of 155 cases (23.2%) involving a male plaintiff and 15 of 155 cases (9.7%) involving a female plaintiff. Our categorical scheme is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801213490558">Table 3</xref>, which indicates the probability of denial of a TRO by plaintiff gender based upon information available in the files. According to their written justifications, judges were more than twice as likely to deny a TRO petition submitted by males than females by reason of “insufficiency of facts.” The following examples are complete and exact quotations of plaintiff (male and female) descriptions of the precipitating abuse which judges explicitly identified as failing to meet the sufficiency of facts standard:</p>

<p>Taking judicial comments and coder judgments together, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801213490558">Table 3</xref> suggests two important conclusions. First, judges are three times as likely to deny a TRO to male plaintiffs on the basis of failure to meet the sufficiency standard, compared to female plaintiffs (13.5% vs. 4.5%). Second, confirming the analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801213490558">Jordan, Pritchard, Wilcox, &amp; Duckett-Pritchard (2008)</xref> whose study focused exclusively on denied petitions, insufficiency of facts is also the most frequently cited reason overall for denial of a temporary protective order (28/51 = 54.9%).</p>
<p>In addition to the problems posed for judges by these rather sparse descriptions, judicial comments indicated in nine cases (six male, three female) that the plaintiff was seeking an inappropriate order and recommended filing a family law case and/or a petition under the Uniform Parenting Act. Finally, judicial justifications for denial indicate a small number of cases fell into miscellaneous categories such as filed in the wrong jurisdiction, or there was an inexplicably lengthy delay in filing, or the plaintiff was already engaged in an ongoing case with which the TRO request should be conjoined. In eight cases (seven males, one female) no explanation for denial was indicated and we were unable to confidently assign the judge’s reasoning.</p>

<title>PRO Hearing Dates</title>
<p>The decision to grant a permanent order hearing date is important because it grants those denied a temporary order a second opportunity to argue the case for a restraining order. Our data indicate that 92.3% of female plaintiffs and 87.7% of male plaintiffs are afforded this opportunity. This difference is not statistically significant and, consequently, we attempt no further analysis of this outcome measure. It is noteworthy, however, that among the 36 male plaintiffs who were denied a TRO, 17 (47.2%) were nonetheless granted a PRO hearing date. Of the 15 female plaintiffs denied a TRO, three (20%) were granted a PRO hearing.</p>

<p>As stated in the methods section, we have removed 204 cases from our data set and report the rate of issuance of PROs only for the remaining 106 cases that are eligible for such an order. Of these, 94 (88.7%) received the requested PRO and in 12 cases the temporary domestic violence restraining order (DVRO) was vacated, meaning a permanent order was denied. Among female petitioners (<italic>N</italic> = 58), 93.1% received such an order compared to 83.3% of male petitioners (<italic>N</italic> = 48); this difference is not statistically significant. Nor was there any evidence of a suppression effect, since plaintiff gender did not attain significance when introduced into a logit model including control variables (not shown, available on request.).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> state that when analyzing the decision to issue a PRO they removed from this table only 18 N/A cases where the “adjudication was still underway” (p. 632). Elsewhere, they indicate the outcome was unknown for one case and thus their analysis of PROs is based upon the remaining 138 cases. We believe this procedure to be flawed. The alternative procedure (followed, for example, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490558">Basile, [2005]</xref>) is to remove those cases which, following the definitions provided in the footnote to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077801213490558">Table 4</xref>, do not involve a judicial decision. When this procedure is followed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al.’s (2009)</xref> data indicate—contrary to their analysis—the absence of gender discrimination on the part of judges when issuing permanent protective orders. When cases are properly removed (i.e., all but those designated as “restraining order” and “vacated” in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077801213490558">Table 4</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077801213490558">9</xref></sup> only 41 cases requiring a discretionary judicial decision remain in their study. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077801213490558">Table 4</xref> indicates that 40 of these received a permanent order and in only one instance was the DVRO vacated (i.e., petition denied).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077801213490558">10</xref></sup> While we do not know the gender of this denied case, these data clearly leave no opportunity for a statistically significant gender disparity finding.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this analysis we have replicated an earlier study in this jurisdiction, which assessed the impact of plaintiff gender on court decision-making in CRO cases. Our methodological approach differed from the first study in a number of ways, including a larger stratified random sample, a greater number of control variables, removal of all cases from the PRO analysis that did not involve a discretionary judicial decision, and the inclusion of qualitative data. Our findings depart in a number of ways from those reported in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> study.</p>
<p>Only in the granting of TROs did we find a statistically significant gender difference in the direction indicated by the earlier study, though with a greatly reduced effect size (risk ratio = 1.18 vs. 1.64). As confirmed by the odds ratio, the influence of gender in our regression model was considerably smaller than was found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009</xref>; 2.4 vs. 12.9, respectively). Unlike the earlier study, we found violence severity to be more strongly associated with TRO outcomes than plaintiff gender. Moreover, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> found no gender differences in victim violence severity, we found that female plaintiffs were twice as likely to be the victims of the most severe forms of violence.</p>
<p>Since plaintiff gender does attain significance in the issuance of temporary orders, the hypothesis of judicial discrimination against male victims at this level of decision-making must remain viable. On the other hand, the analysis of judicial explanations for denial suggests the influence of gender may reflect legally insufficient male descriptions of abuse, rather than discrimination by judges.</p>
<p>The data reported here indicate that female victims employ, on average, 72.5% more words than males to describe the precipitating incident of abuse (74.0 vs. 42.9 words, respectively). While a word count is unquestionably a crude measure of “sufficiency of facts” (the judicial standard for granting a TRO), it nonetheless suggests that female plaintiffs may offer a more complete account of their victimization experience than male plaintiffs. If this is true, it could reflect a number of factors. It is possible that female plaintiffs offer more detailed descriptions of abuse because they have more abuse to detail. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801213490558">Melton and Belknap (2003)</xref> analyzed law enforcement summaries and found that accounts by female victims “indicated more detailed and hostile threats than most of the descriptions of female threats against male victims” (p. 341). Female victim accounts were also found to be more detailed because male violence was more likely to involve “a string of abusive actions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801213490558">Melton &amp; Belknap, 2003</xref>, p. 342). Male victim accounts of female aggression, on the other hand, “rarely mentioned more than one or two abusive actions” (p. 342).</p>
<p>In a similar vein, female plaintiffs may have a greater stake in the outcome than male plaintiffs, and thus have a greater incentive to provide more complete descriptions of abuse. Women are more likely than men to express fear of their abusers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801213490558">Durfee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801213490558">Melton &amp; Belknap, 2003</xref>), and fear could be a powerful stimulus to provide as much information as possible in order to maximize the possibility of a favorable judicial response to the TRO request.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077801213490558">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>An alternative (or supplemental) explanation for the observed word-count disparity may lie in differences between male and female plaintiffs’ awareness of the need to provide judges with detailed accounts of abuse. Since males are much less likely than females to rely on restraining orders to manage their personal relationships, this should mean that they are less likely to participate in social networks where information about such orders would be available to them. Moreover, such information may be more likely to be shared among women than among men, for whom such admissions may be damaging to self-esteem and feelings of masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801213490558">Migliaccio, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801213490558">2002</xref>). For the same reason, men may be less likely to attend CRO training sessions offered by Sacramento County. Consequently, they would not have the benefit of advice offered in such sessions, which emphasizes the need to provide adequate information to judges about the precipitating abuse. For all these reasons, male petitioners may be less aware than female petitioners of the need to provide judges with a detailed and complete account of their victimization.</p>
<p>Since limited resources required us to confine our focus to descriptions of abuse associated with judicial denial, we cannot rule out the possibility that equally sparse descriptions may have been responded to differently by judges according to plaintiff gender. It is clear, however, that the research literature provides multiple hypotheses, in addition to gender discrimination, that might account for the observed disparity in the issuance of temporary orders.</p>
<p>In addition to plaintiff gender and violence severity, both marital status and filing delay reduce the likelihood of a TRO. Marital status is very likely influential because of its relationship to other decisions, such as custody and visitation rights, which are likely to be the subject of other court actions. In such cases judges often recommend filing a different petition covering those matters with which the restraining order issue can be “consolidated.” The role of delay most likely reflects the judge’s view that violence, which it is the purpose of a temporary order to forestall, is not imminent.</p>
<p>We did not find it necessary to analyze the granting of PRO hearing dates in depth since no statistically significant gender difference was found. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> did not address this outcome measure, even though its importance in relation to the ultimate likelihood of receiving a permanent order is clear. The absence of a gender difference, coupled with the observation that almost half (47.2%) of male plaintiffs denied a TRO nonetheless received a PRO hearing date, runs counter to the gender discrimination hypothesis.</p>
<p>With respect to the judicial decision to grant or deny a permanent order, we differ strongly from the earlier study. The decision by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> to include in their analysis those cases in which judges did not engage in discretionary decision-making is, in our view, a misconceptualization of the decision-making process. We argue that when these cases are properly removed, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> data set supports a position contrary to the one they advance, and that judges, in fact, do not practice gender discrimination when issuing these orders. Our own data confirm that revised conclusion.</p>
<p>We therefore view <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al.’s (2009)</xref> assertion that it is “not very” (p. 633) likely that male plaintiffs who request a TRO will ultimately receive a permanent order as misleading. A more accurate formulation would be that among male plaintiffs who seek a temporary order, it is “very” likely that they will ultimately receive a permanent order <italic>provided they appear at the PRO hearing and request such an order.</italic> Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> do not remove from their analysis those cases that fail to meet these (and other) criteria, their study confounds petitioner behavior with judicial decision-making.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Future Research</title>
<p>The existing research literature relies heavily on the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490558">Basile (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> to inform our understanding of the relationship between plaintiff gender and judicial decision-making in the issuance of civil restraining orders. These studies have distinct, but also overlapping, difficulties in the areas of site demographics, sample size, number of control variables, reliance on contingency tables, and conceptualization of the dependent variables. These limitations impose a severe caution on acceptance of the findings and conclusions reported. In this article we have replicated one of these studies while attempting to correct for the weaknesses perceived in that earlier work. Our conclusions differ substantially from those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> and question the claim that judges, relying on stereotypes of female aggression, discriminate against male plaintiffs when extending the protection of civil restraining orders. The policy recommendation offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> that judges receive education on “the prevalence, nature and consequences” (p. 635) of female intimate aggression is, in our view, premature.</p>
<p>A second objective of this study has been to assess the applicability to the civil court context of theoretical findings concerning the role of perpetrator gender in criminal court decision-making. It is important to bear in mind that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> explain gender differences in CRO issuance rates in terms of perpetrator gender, specifically, a paternalistic stereotype of female aggression allegedly held by judges. In our view, the data reported here are more strongly supportive of the “equal treatment” hypothesis than either the “chivalry/paternalism” or “evil woman” hypotheses. As noted above, plaintiff gender is somewhat influential only in relation to the issuance of TROs, but not to the granting of hearing dates or PROs. The qualitative data suggest that “insufficient” male plaintiff descriptions of abuse, rather than judicial stereotypes of female aggression, may well explain the difference in TRO outcomes. These findings are therefore compatible with criminal court research that emphasizes the reduction of gender differences in outcomes in the presence of appropriate controls, and that residual disparities do not necessarily reflect official discrimination. Since the judges presiding over these cases are all experienced criminal court judges, this consistency between the criminal court and civil court contexts is not surprising.</p>
<p>Several lines of future research are suggested by these data. The overrepresentation of African American males and females as perpetrators in the data set requires further exploration. Whether this reflects a greater frequency of intimate violence in the African American community or a greater willingness to rely on official intervention remains to be determined. The overrepresentation of Hispanic males as perpetrators relative to the county population is equally of interest. The underrepresentation of Hispanic female perpetrators may reflect lower actual rates of abuse, or cultural conceptions of masculinity and an associated reluctance by male victims to publicly acknowledge victimization. Alternatively, undocumented immigration status and its attendant difficulties may contribute to male reluctance to seek these orders.</p>
<p>More extensive qualitative analysis of victim descriptions of abuse would help to clarify the relationship between gender and the likelihood of receiving a TRO. Since the qualitative data in this study focused only on denials, we cannot resolve the issue of whether or not similar descriptions of abuse might be responded to differently by judges depending on the gender of the plaintiff. The qualitative analysis of law enforcement summaries of victims’ accounts of abuse offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801213490558">Melton and Belknap (2003)</xref> would be a useful starting point in this endeavor. The brevity, along with grammatical and spelling errors, of many plaintiff descriptions is troubling in its implication that those of lesser education, or for whom English is a second language, may be less favorably situated to receive the requested orders. Courts could show sensitivity to this issue by encouraging these plaintiffs to consult with court service providers for assistance with these problems and to promptly refile their TRO requests. Dismissing requests or only setting a PRO hearing date in these cases could endanger victims whose circumstances may be no less urgent than others.</p>
<p>The focus in the literature (including this study) on heterosexual couples needs to be expanded to include same-sex relationships. Juvenile restraining orders have received far less than their due in the research literature and await further scrutiny. Finally, the perceived efficacy of restraining orders has been studied only from the perspective of female recipients of these orders. Whether there are gender differences in these perceptions is, as yet, unknown.</p>

<p> Low severity = no physical acts, only threats</p>
<p> Medium severity = Behavior representing ”minor” physical threats to victim such such as “slapping, pushing, shoving, poking, spitting, pulling hair, and so forth”</p>
<p> High severity = Behavior representing “major” physical threat to victim such Act(s) likely to result in serious physical or death, including broken bones, loss of teeth or consciousness, lacerations, internal injury, throwing dangerous objects, use or brandishing of weapons and so forth.</p>

<p>In our coding scheme 32 cases were coded as “more severe” and in every case a TRO was granted. Logit analysis will not accept an independent variable when there is no distribution on the dependent variable. To accommodate this problem we included as “more severe” five additional cases (three female, two male plaintiffs) in which violence was alleged against a child, reasoning that a judge would regard this as more severe. One of these five cases was denied a TRO and this provided the necessary distribution. Our assessment of the influence of violence severity in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801213490558">Table 2</xref> is therefore conservative.</p>

<label>8.</label>
<p>The possibility that the number of words employed might be a meaningful variable only became apparent late in the data collection process. This count was made for all cases processed in the last four months of the sampled period (i.e., December 2009 through March 2010). The characterization of this group of cases as a random subset of the total sample is based upon the assumption of no seasonal variation.</p>

<p>Nullification of marriage is not a possible judicial response to a request for a civil restraining order. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> do not explain the presence of this category in their table.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-1077801213490558">

<p>There are inconsistencies in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801213490558">Muller et al. (2009)</xref> analysis that render summation difficult. For example, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801213490558">Table 3</xref> in their article indicates only 39 cases received a PRO, whereas their <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801213490558">Table 1</xref> (from which our <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077801213490558">Table 4</xref> is excerpted) identifies 40 cases as receiving this order.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-1077801213490558">
<label>11.</label>
<p>In the random subsample we coded for whether the plaintiff indicated fear of the alleged perpetrator. In only 18 cases (15.7%) was this reference present and in every case a TRO was granted. Female plaintiffs, however, were twice as likely as male plaintiffs to indicate fear (21.1% vs. 10.3%). Had we coded the entire sample for this variable and included it in the logistic regression model it is likely that the influence of plaintiff gender would have been substantially reduced.</p>
