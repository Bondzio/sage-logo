<abstract>
<p>This article explores the indexicality (the ideological process that links language and identity) of “standard” edited American English and the ideologies (specifically, standard language ideology and Whiteness) that work to create and justify common patterns that associate privileged White students with written standardness and that disassociate underrepresented—especially African American—students from “standard” edited American English. Drawing on interviews with composition instructors about their readings of anonymous student texts, the author argues that indexicality and standardness are mutually informative: The non/standard features of student texts operate as indexicals for student-author identities just as perceived student-author identities influence the reading of a text as non/standard. Ultimately, this article offers inroads to challenging destructive and enduring indexical patterns that offer unearned privilege to some students at the expense of others and, in the process, perpetuate race- and class-based privilege.AQ Note that APA style capitalizes Black and White.</p>

<p>As a field, composition studies recognizes “standard” edited American English<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0741088312438691">1</xref></sup> (SEAE) as a gatekeeper that often excludes nontraditional students from academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741088312438691">Bizzell, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741088312438691">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088312438691">Canagarajah, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741088312438691">Courts, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741088312438691">Fox, 2002</xref>). However, instructors and scholars who want to resist SEAE and its gatekeeping function often feel conflicted because of the strong possibility that other classes and contexts will expect mastery of this dialect. Indeed, many instructors feel compelled to demand SEAE for that very reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741088312438691">Delpit, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741088312438691">Smith, 1997</xref>). This seemingly widespread acceptance of the professional charge to teach and/or expect SEAE (as evidenced in scholarship and textbooks) draws on and contributes to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088312438691">Matsuda’s (2006)</xref> “myth of linguistic homogeneity” or the erroneous but prevalent assumption that all composition students wield “standard” English. The “linguistic homogeneity” that Matsuda describes and labels as myth is inextricably linked to notions of unmarkedness, or a sense of particular kinds of language use as “normal” and in contrast with other, marked language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741088312438691">McArthur, 1992</xref>, p. 645). Furthermore, the belief that SEAE is unmarked and common more or less explicitly implies a certain identity-less-ness associated with this language variety, a “bleach[ing] . . . of markers that reveal . . . native regional and social dialect[s], especially if these dialects are considered nonstandard by society at large” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741088312438691">Moss &amp; Walters, 1993</xref>, p. 444). However, what much of composition scholarship ignores (at least by omission) is that it is impossible for a dialect to be completely unmarked. According to Donald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741088312438691">Rubin (1995)</xref>, so-called “‘unmarked forms’ are really just normative forms, that is, representing social and political prestige” (p. 6). In the case of SEAE, I assert that although this normative dialect may work to erase some identity cues in texts, it still signals a privileged author, often White and middle or upper-middle class. Indeed, as I discuss in this article, in a small qualitative study involving 12 composition instructors from two midwestern institutions, student essays that were perceived to be “standard” were also perceived to be written by White middle- to upper-middle-class student authors.</p>
<p>Certainly there is significant scholarship within the field that considers the relationship between writing and identity, especially at the level of literacy (from the perspective of New Literacy Studies) and D/discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741088312438691">Gee, 1992</xref>). This prevalent scholarship links language and identity and often works as a frame for considering the dilemma of whether and how to teach SEAE in composition courses, focusing much of the conversation on issues of access and power. Other areas of study that address the relationship between writing and identity include studies on how writers represent their identities within their writing (e.g., some scholarship on voice and work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741088312438691">Ivanic, 1998</xref>) and readers’ impressions of writers’ personalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741088312438691">Hatch, Hill, &amp; Hayes, 1993</xref>). There is little scholarship, though, that looks at the ways that particular language features do or do not signal specific identities—or said another way, there is little composition scholarship that considers indexicality.</p>
<p>One notable exception is research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741088312438691">Matsuda and Tardy (2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741088312438691">Tardy &amp; Matsuda, 2009</xref>) on the authorial construction of “voice,” which they defined as a written identity created by the writer, the text, and the reader. Although they do not term it as such, my understanding of their use of <italic>voice</italic> aligns considerably with the concept of indexicality (discussed in greater detail below). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741088312438691">Matsuda and Tardy (2007)</xref> first performed a small-scale study on reader-constructed authorial voice and then broadened their scope and surveyed blind manuscript reviewers (from the fields of applied linguistics and rhetoric and composition) to verify their findings from the initial study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741088312438691">Tardy &amp; Matsuda, 2009</xref>). Their research suggested that readers do look for clues about writers’ identities—whether or not they are established scholars or students (do they know the conventions?), their race (are there any linguistic markers?), their gender (what is the tone?), their nationality (are there indicators of English being the second language?), and so on. According to their research, “over 80% of participants [stated] that they had speculated or had a sense of the author when reading a blind manuscript” (p. 43). Taking these findings as a starting point for my research, I sought to explore not whether but <italic>how</italic> instructors construct authorial identity when reading anonymous student texts. Specifically, I designed and conducted a qualitative study to address, in part, the following research questions: As composition instructors read anonymous student writing, how do they infer details about authorial identity; what aspects of written language do they perceive as indexical (such as words or phrases, sentence structures, rhetorical choices, topic); and how do they understand and talk about the relationship between language and identity?</p>
<p>This article describes the study and findings to begin conversations about indexicality associated with SEAE and to identify areas for future research and scholarly attention. It does not aim to make generalizations or claims about the ways that composition instructors interact with student papers or construct authorial identities when reading student papers. However, I do use the findings to theorize about indexicality related to SEAE and to engage ongoing conversations on the topic. In this article, I argue that examining the indexicality of SEAE—including the enduring patterns<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0741088312438691">2</xref></sup> that link certain identities or identity profiles to written standardness while making other identities incongruent with SEAE—adds complexity to composition studies’ conversations about the existing and ideal role of SEAE in composition courses, especially concerning the potential “stakes” for students. I also suggest that Matsuda’s “linguistic homogeneity” extends to perceptions of homogeneous student identities (beyond notions of student nationality) associated with standardness and that these two “myths” can work to create each other. Finally, I argue that the potential for the gatekeeping associated with SEAE may be as much about the reception of student texts as the insistence that they be produced in SEAE. Before describing the study and findings, I first offer a brief discussion of the theoretical frames—indexicality, language ideology, and Whiteness—as they apply to this research.</p>
<sec id="section1-0741088312438691">
<title>Indexicality, Standard Language Ideology, and Whiteness</title>
<p>Broadly speaking, <italic>indexicality</italic> is “the creation of semiotic links between linguistic forms and social meanings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741088312438691">Bucholtz &amp; Hall, 2005</xref>, p. 594). This means that people rely on various language practices, language features, or languages in general to determine or create identity, to assign various characteristics to people and social groups, and to mark group membership. As a simple example, a person who uses the word <italic>wicked</italic> as an intensifier will likely be perceived to be young and from New England (and potentially as aligned with certain sports teams, schools, dispositions, etc.). Moreover, others who also identify with these identities may be more likely to treat the person in positive ways—inviting him or her to a social event, offering help if the person seems to be in need, preferring him or her for a job position over other applicants, and so on. Although an everyday (all day) practice that people use for various outcomes and purposes, indexicality can be used as a means of stereotyping, justifying inequality, and perpetuating oppression. There is significant sociolinguistic scholarship detailing the possible negative outcomes of indexicality, sometimes called “linguistic profiling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741088312438691">Baugh, 2000</xref>). Although the concept is commonly used with spoken language, this article and study apply the concept to written language. Indexicality, of course, is inherently ideological. Linking language to identity and using language to constitute identity “relies heavily on ideological structures [that include judgments] about the sorts of speakers who (can or should) produce particular sorts of language” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741088312438691">Bucholtz &amp; Hall, 2005</xref>, p. 594). All sorts of ideologies can contribute to indexicality; however, this project focuses on standard language ideology and Whiteness (an ideology that I define below).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741088312438691">Lesley Milroy (1999)</xref>, “the chief characteristic of a standard [language] ideology is the belief that there is one and only one correct spoken form of the language, modelled [<italic>sic</italic>] on a single correct written form” (p. 174). This one correct form is often identifiable in contrast to all that is not standard. Because SLI creates an environment in which it is common sense to privilege one language variety, it becomes acceptable and common sense to discriminate against other language varieties. Indeed, in contrast to the standard, all other language varieties are labeled “nonstandard,” which can quickly become <italic>sub</italic>standard. It is not enough for standard languages to be thought of as better than other language varieties; they also have to be widely available, “a realizable asset” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741088312438691">Silverstein, 1996</xref>, p. 291) to be fully endorsed <italic>and</italic> hide power relations. As such, standard language varieties must be perceived as unaffiliated: <italic>All</italic> groups stand to benefit from using the standard language variety; no one group has more access than any other to the standard language; and the standard language is not connect to identity—it is nonindexical. SLI then provides the belief system and justification necessary for mandating SEAE and denigrating other language varieties—and the people who use them—and masks the politics associated with such acts. This article describes the indexicality of perceptions of (non)standardness in student texts—stemming in part from SLI.</p>
<p>Given the prevalent portrayal of SEAE as nonindexical and SLI’s reliance on this view of SEAE, Whiteness is another important ideology for considering the indexicality revealed in this study. Drawing on scholarship by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741088312438691">Alice McIntyre (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088312438691">Peter McLaren (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741088312438691">Nakayama and Krizek (1995)</xref>, I have come to a working definition of Whiteness as an ideology of privilege and neutrality that actively creates continued White dominance, drawing on and reinforcing historical and structural inequality while denying its existence and/or power. In this project, Whiteness is especially useful for understanding the negative valuing of difference that allows a positioning of SEAE as superior to other language varieties. As I discuss later, this hierarchical positioning of dialects plays a role in indexicality.</p>

<title>Study Design and Data Analysis</title>
<p>In this study I asked 12 composition instructors from two institutions to read three anonymous student essays and to mark the texts where they strayed from their expectations for college writing. I then interviewed the instructors about their readings of the papers and the identities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0741088312438691">3</xref></sup> they imagined for the student-authors.</p>
<p>The composition instructors I interviewed taught at one of two public midwestern universities—City University (CU) and Midwestern University (MU). CU is an urban university with a student population of approximately 29,000. According to data from its website, the racial demographics of students are as follows: 50% White, 26% African American, 6% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 2% Hispanic. In contrast, MU is located in a college town, and its 41,000 students are considerably more racially homogeneous; 75% of undergraduates self-identify as White.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0741088312438691">4</xref></sup> Although there are no available statistics to generalize about students’ socioeconomic status (SES) at either institution, the significant difference in tuition (MU costs approximately 60% more than CU) suggests that students at MU are likely to be, on average, from a higher SES.</p>
<p>The participating instructors in this study were all current composition instructors who had taught at least 10 sections of college writing. Of the 12 instructors, all were White, and there were equal number males and females (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0741088312438691">Appendix A</xref>). Ten instructors self-identified as coming from a middle-class background; the remaining two self-identified as coming from a lower- or working-class SES. While I had hoped to have more (or any) racial diversity among the instructors in this study, it is not surprising to have all White instructors. In fact, if membership in composition studies’ professional organization is any indication, the majority (86%) of composition instructors are White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088312438691">Middleton, 2009</xref>). Therefore, while it would have been instructive to comparatively interrogate the role of instructors’ race in their production of student identities, it is useful to examine the practices of the powerful racial majority within the field of composition.</p>
<p>Prior to being interviewed, each instructor read, responded to, and graded three anonymous student papers. (See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0741088312438691">Appendix B</xref> for the full instructions for the participants and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-0741088312438691">Appendix C</xref> for the interview protocol.) I used semistructured interviews and a modified talk-aloud protocol to determine instructors’ responses to the papers and their construction of student-author identity. In the interviews, participants were prompted to describe how each of the three papers met (or did not meet) their expectations for “good” college writing and how they perceived the student-author of each paper. I began the interviews with a broad, even vague, request (“please briefly describe the student-authors you pictured when reading these papers”) so that instructors would not be overly guided by my question. Much later in the interview, I returned to this question but asked instructors to use more detail in their description. Depending on the instructors’ responses, I asked follow-up questions about gender, class, race, prior educational experience, geographic background, and so on. And, always, I asked the instructors to explain what in the text signaled those identity characteristics. In addition to asking questions about student-author identity, I asked the instructors to talk through their responses to and comments on one of the three papers to make sure I understood their notation system. I then prompted the instructors to tell me what was striking about each paper. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741088312438691">Matsuda and Tardy’s (2007)</xref> research on voice informed my methodology, primarily by showing that it was possible to study indexicality—a largely subconscious, ideological process—in writing. In addition, like Matsuda and Tardy, I asked my participants to read and respond to texts; then, I interviewed them about this experience.</p>
<p>Note that the purpose of this study was not to determine whether instructors could correctly determine the student-author identity. Therefore, when choosing student essays, I did not attempt to pick papers based on various features, such as approach to topic, presence of textual markers, or other content-related criteria. Additionally, although I admit that it would be useful to understand how instructors imagine identity when they know the student—which is more akin to what usually happens when instructors read student papers—I chose to use anonymous papers as a first step. I wanted the instructors to be focused on the language within the student essays more than what they thought they knew about actual embodied students. Additionally, there are times when instructors read anonymous student texts—times that are associated with high stakes for students, such as college admission essays and AP exams. Therefore, I argue that the findings from this study offer important considerations for the field and its practitioners as related to actual professional practices that one might encounter and in terms of beginning to think more carefully about indexicality—about how specific language features can signal identities within student writing.</p>
<p>All student papers used in this study—nine in total—were written by first-year students at MU the summer before they matriculated as part of the directed self-placement process. The students all responded to the same prompt, which asked them to read and analyze an article and write a 750- to 900-word argument-based response. I chose nine essays (as opposed to the same three essays read by all instructors) to get a broader range of student writing. This range was important given the focus of my study: the instructors’ responses to the essays and the kinds of features that signal various student-author identities.</p>
<p>The essays chosen for this study were written by male and female students ranging from working to upper-middle class (according to their own self-identification). Because this study centers on issues of privilege and standardness, I chose papers written by students who self-identified as White, African American, or Hispanic (or Latino/a). I chose this racial distribution because the White race typically represents a privileged and powerful position in the academy while African American and Hispanic students are not only underrepresented but historically marginalized by their language use. Four essays were written by White students; three were written by African American students; and two were written by Hispanic students. (See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4-0741088312438691">Appendices D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0741088312438691">E</xref> for more information about the papers according to the race, class, and gender of the author and the distribution of papers to the 12 instructors.) I did not exclude any papers from this study; the nine essays I used were the first nine for which I received permission and that also filled my chosen racial distribution. After I collected the papers, the directors of MU’s writing program and its writing center both reviewed the nine essays and confirmed that, from their experience, the sample reflected writing commonly encountered in first-year composition courses in terms of genre, topic, and skill level.</p>
<p>I used thematic and discourse analysis to interpret the interview transcripts. The analysis described in this article, though, is primarily thematic—a kind of inductive analysis, involving “identifying salient themes, recurring ideas or language, and patterns of belief” in order to create “grounded categories of meaning held by participants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741088312438691">Marshall &amp; Rossman, 2006</xref>, 158-159). This form of analysis revealed patterns of response and illuminated the relationship between various language features and class-, race-, and gender-based indexicality.</p>
<p>In a study about language and identity, it is hard to overstate the role of the researcher in the collection and interpretation of the data. Certainly, multiple aspects of my personal and professional identities are relevant to my interactions with the study participants and the data. Specifically, my identity as White and middle class aligns precisely with 10 of the 12 study participants. Although there is considerable variation within those social categories, the privilege associated with the White race and middle-class status relies on certain worldviews and makes me especially vulnerable to the ideological masking I hoped to uncover in this study. Additionally, my gender, race, perceived class, and affiliation with MU (as an instructor and graduate student) undoubtedly influenced the ways in which the study participants responded to my questions, my topic, and me. The reverse is also true—the gender, race, and perceived class of my study participants likely influenced the way I interpreted what they said and how they said it. These factors of research are unavoidable. Instead of attempting to work against these realities, I attempted to work with them—to be aware of potential biases, to reflexively consider the role of race, gender, and class (and other relevant identity markers) as I engaged with my participants and the data. However, reflexivity alone is limited. Therefore, I also incorporated member checking to address the many ways in which my role as a researcher could interfere with the validity of my research.</p>
<p>Finally, the goal of this study is not to make generalizations about the responses of 12 composition instructors. Instead, this project aims to come to new understandings about SEAE through the interplay between this study and existing scholarship on language, identity, and related ideologies. In the remainder of this article, I describe the role of language in creating readers’ perceptions of student-author identities, the role of perceived student-author identities in influencing the interpretation of “difference” in student texts, and the role of standardness in this bidirectional indexicality.</p>

<sec id="section3-0741088312438691">
<title>“Obvious Tip Offs”: Classed, Raced, and Gendered Language</title>
<p>The data from the interviews clearly show that the instructors imagined students based on language in the student essays—or if they did not have a picture of a student-author at first reading, they were able to turn to various aspects of language use to make “guesses” about student identities. The most common categories for standardness at the sentence level (i.e., features that could be isolated within a particular sentence) and the text level (i.e., features that existed within sentences but worked to effect the entire text) were as follows: grammar and usage (including spelling, misused homonyms, punctuation, sentence boundaries, subject-verb agreement, pronoun-noun agreement, missing words, syntax, and concision), audience awareness (including tone and context), academic conventions (including diction, incorporating cited material, analysis, and thesis statements), organization, and clarity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0741088312438691">5</xref></sup> In this section, I describe the ways that student writing signaled classed, raced, and gendered identities for the instructors. As I describe below, these identity categories—particularly those of class and race—are positioned as integrally related to educational exposure and achievement for students in our society and in the geographic context of this study.</p>
<sec id="section4-0741088312438691">
<title>Class</title>
<p>The category <italic>class</italic> reveals the instructors’ overwhelming sense that students’ SES affects their educational experiences and can be seen in their writing. The instructors in this study repeatedly linked “good” writing with a “good” high school education and, by association, class (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088312438691">Figure 1</xref> for extended examples). Because class was so tightly linked to prior educational experiences, which was presumed to greatly affect students’ writing holistically, a range of language features functioned indexically for this category. However, the language features that were read as adherence to academic conventions were the most common indexicals (60%) for class. Not surprisingly, instructors believed that students who have gone to good (i.e., wealthy and well resourced) high schools have had more exposure to the conventions of academic discourses, which is evident in their writing. Examples of academic conventions include tone, diction, argument and analysis, and the integration of citations and quotations. Of these categories, comments about tone and diction were the most common (representing 80% of all features perceived to be academic conventions).</p>

</fig>
<p>The chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088312438691">Figure 1</xref> organizes excerpts from the interviews into language categories that served as indexicals for class in this study. I have included examples from the three most prevalent categories overall—tone, diction, and grammar and usage—which, combined, represent 80% of all the indexicals for class. Other categories of language use that served as indexicals for class but are not included in the chart include argument and analysis, citations and quotations, engagement with topic, and quality of writing.</p>
<p>Tone and diction are related categories of language use; however, I chose to separate them to locate them at the text level and sentence level, respectively. Tone is an attitude in the paper, which is often governed by generic expectations. For example, instructors repeatedly referenced confidence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088312438691">Figure 1</xref>, Nos. 1-3) or, conversely, uncertainty (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088312438691">Figure 1</xref>, No. 4) in student prose as an indexical for class. Diction, however, is vocabulary or syntax linked to registers. In this study, instructors commented on students’ facility with vocabulary (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088312438691">Figure 1</xref>, No. 11) or awkward syntax resulting from an attempt to mimic an academic register (also called “overwriting” or “Engfish” in this study; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088312438691">Figure 1</xref>, Nos. 8 and 9); instructors turned to these language features to make assumptions about students’ past educational experiences and SES. In particular, instructors seemed to assume that an awareness of academic conventions—including a confident tone and word choice that creates a distanced, objective diction—suggests a better high school and higher SES.</p>
<p>While the grammar and usage category had the most examples of any given category (12 compared to 8 each for tone and diction), the conflation of class and race in this study makes it difficult to tell which identity category is more relevant to the instructors. The many references to the <italic>inner-city</italic> in this section show the tangled connections between the categories of <italic>race</italic> and <italic>class.</italic> Specifically, <italic>inner-city</italic> refers to poor or working-class African Americans for the instructors in this study—a point I elaborate when discussing the indexicals for race. For now, it is worth noting that indexicality associated with grammar and usage was almost always tied to nonstandard features (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088312438691">Figure 1</xref>, Nos. 12-14).</p>
<p>To help readers navigate the chart, I have used bold and underlining to highlight the aforementioned patterns: The bold words or phrases illustrate indexicality associated with confidence (or anxiety) and a sense of academic conventions; the underlined words or phrases illustrate the role of grammar and usage features in indexing both race and class simultaneously.</p>

<sec id="section5-0741088312438691">
<title>Race</title>
<p>While class was linked to instructors’ conceptions of standardness, race was linked to class—at least implicitly—for 10 of the 12 instructors. The instructors’ assumptions about the relationship between educational privilege and race cannot be separated from socioeconomic class. The evidence of White privilege in our society—in this case, manifest as economic and educational privilege—was convincing to the instructors and served as a backdrop for conversations about race, class, and education in the interviews. Specifically, instructors explained racial indexicality as linked to an assumption that White students “have been given more of an education” (Richard). As such, for the participants who noted the connection between race and class, White was linked to standard, or “good,” writing. Rachel expressed this connection explicitly, stating that “mostly the quality of writing with people of color tends to be not as good as the White folks.” Although only two other instructors made explicit comments about this connection, the logical progression of assuming that better writing is linked to better preparedness—which is likely to mean that the student comes from a wealthier school district (i.e., the student is probably middle to upper-middle class and White)—ultimately functioned to create a stereotype of privileged White students who have had better educations and are therefore better writers. Of course, the interview specifically asked instructors to call on and note patterns from their teaching experience, which implicitly encouraged stereotyping. Therefore, the repeated conflation of class and education and the connection of these categories to race are understandable. Nonetheless, this logical reasoning ultimately works to reinforce and perpetuate standard language ideology and Whiteness.</p>
<p>One important factor in the consideration of race in this study is the close proximity of CU and MU to Metropolis—CU is located in Metropolis, and MU is within an hour’s drive from the city. Metropolis is a large, predominately African American city with a failing school district. Likely because of this, race was reduced to African American or White, with the exception of a handful of discussions about English-as-a-second-language or English-as-a-foreign-language Asian students and an acknowledgment of other prevalent racial categories on each campus. The perception of African American students as coming from Metropolis Public Schools contributed to instructors’ sense that White students are often better prepared educationally than Black students. When instructors talked about “urban” or “inner city” students, they always did so to signal race (African American) and class (low SES). For example, Carol first referred to “urban black kids,” which she held in opposition to “middle class kids.” Later, she reduced this identity category to “inner city.” When asked about class and race associated with this category, she affirmed that “inner city” has SES connotations and that she was envisioning an African American student. For 75% of the instructors, the reduction of race to African American or White and the assumption that African American students are products of poor inner-city schools reinforced the perceived connection between “nonstandard” writing and African American students and “standard” writing and White students and perpetuated Whiteness.</p>
<p>Although the instructors commonly linked race and class, the indexicals for these identity categories differed. The chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741088312438691">Figure 2</xref> represents examples from the three most common categories of racial indexicals in this study: grammar, dialect, and diction—all of which were treated as sentence-level language features and, combined, make up 61% of the total indexicals for race. Other categories not included in the chart are organization, argument and analysis, quality of writing, engagement with topics, and worldview. The examples in the chart make visible SLI’s positioning of nonstandard language varieties or features as substandard and the role of Whiteness in linking White people with standardness while positioning other races in opposition to the standard. Specifically, there is not one example of instructors noting a positive feature in the text as an indexical for African American students. Additionally, although some of the instructors noted a dialect of English associated with African Americans, they never considered the possibility of grammatical difference being dialectal difference, even when they stated that those grammatical differences (read as errors) specifically signal African American students. Again, this study did not aim to compare instructors’ perceptions and interpretations of difference with what actually existed in the texts. Therefore, I am not claiming that there were no instances of African American Language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741088312438691">Smitherman, 2006</xref>) in the texts that the instructors did not notice or correctly identify. Instead, I am noting that the instructors did not consider a positive interpretation of grammatical difference as dialectal or language difference, as opposed to error. Finally, the examples in the chart (see Nos. 5, 6, 7, 11, 12) also demonstrate the pattern of absence—of African American Language, “idiosyncratic diction” (Nate), or other “obvious tip offs” (Richard)—functioning as an indexical for White students.</p>

<sec id="section6-0741088312438691">
<title>Gender</title>
<p>In contrast to race- and class-based indexicality, gender-based indexicality was far less likely to be linked to standardness or rely on SLI. Gender is the only identity category for which instructors relied on their intuition (often described as having a sense) as opposed to identifying particular textual features as markers. The willingness to express assumptions about gender without linguistic evidence could indicate that the instructors felt most comfortable making suppositions in this identity category. In fact, Chris admitted that he was more comfortable talking about gender than race. The instructors’ approach to considering gendered identities for the student-authors could also suggest that ideologies about gendered communication styles are more prevalent and more accepted in our society and, as a result, we are less guarded about our gendered assumptions and less likely to feel the need to justify them. Whatever the reason, some instructors did not provide textual evidence for their assumptions about students’ genders. For example, Darrell stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s really hard to put your finger on what it is that makes a paper seem as if it’s written by a male versus a female. I just sort of instinctively feel like this was written by—all three were actually written by guys.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Melissa is another instructor who did not identify specific markers for gender: “I don’t know if I could say what gives me that sense at all [that the author is a male].”</p>
<p>For the instructors who did cite specific cues in the text, engagement with the topic was the most prevalent marker for gender. Eight of 12 instructors noted it as the most compelling marker for at least one of the three essays. Because the student essays were responses to a Malcolm Gladwell article that compares teachers to quarterbacks, the ways that the student-authors interacted with that analogy commonly signaled gender in this study. Instructors repeatedly cited “the way the student latched onto the football thing” (Julie) as an indexical for gender. Additionally, instructors referenced existing stereotypes about differences between male and female communication when acknowledging gender indexicality in the student essays. For example, assertions and a linear organization indexed male authors, and hedging and storytelling through examples signaled female authors.</p>
<p>Although instructors sometimes turned to perceptions of standardness for clues about gender, there was not a consistent linking between either males or females and the “standard.” For example, while women (and, for Rachel, <italic>White</italic> women) fared well in terms of the overall quality of writing in these instructors’ perceptions, they were perceived to employ circular logic, to make fewer assertions, and to use less “rigor” in their argumentation. The treatment of gender as irrelevant to issues of privilege and standardness was expressed through the lack of connections made between gender with race or class and instructors nonsystematically linking gender with non/standardness.</p>
<p>Notably absent from the indexicals for gender was grammar and usage, which is likely related to the perception that gender and sentence-level standardness are unrelated. Instead, as evidenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0741088312438691">Figure 3</xref>, instructors largely relied on text-level standardness, including engagement with topics (35% of total indexicals); the inclusion of Personal experience, affect, and emotion (16% of total indexicals); assertions (13% of total indexicals); organization (13% of total indexicals); and vocabulary (13% of total indexicals) for clues about gender. While vocabulary was connected to diction when it served as an indexical for race and/or class, it did not work in the same way for gender. When the instructors referenced particular words or phrases as signals for gender, they did so because of the meaning of the words or the ways that the words positioned the author, not because of the accuracy of these words or the resulting level of formality associated with the vocabulary choices. For example, Richard thought the phrases “an interesting and intelligent conclusion” and “psychological battle” were feminine, and Nate noted, “Vastly . . . is a word that feels feminine to me.”</p>

<title>Enduring Patterns and “Reverse” Indexicality</title>
<p>As the above section on class, race, and gender shows, there were clear patterns regarding standardness and indexicality. Given the lamination of race and class, African American students (who were always assumed to be from a low SES) were consistently linked with nonstandardness, while White middle- to upper-middle-class students were consistently linked with standardness. These enduring indexical patterns are particularly visible in Melissa’s description of her continuum of standardness and the corresponding student-author identities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0741088312438691">6</xref></sup> Melissa, like other instructors, relied on a continuum of standardness and privilege to understand student writing and student identity. In the quotation that follows, Melissa positioned one identity category (a student from “an inner-city school in Metropolis”) as the proxy for nonstandard writing. She used this proxy as a point of comparison for the paper that she was responding to and her perception of the student’s class identity:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve definitely seen a lot worse. I wouldn’t expect that this student comes from an inner-city school in Metropolis, for example. I think it’s a lot more sophisticated than the kind of writing I’ve seen from most students who come from that background.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Later, she revealed the identity category for standardness as “kids . . . from . . . some of those [wealthy and high-achieving] school districts.” Melissa’s scale of standardness was linked to prior education and, therefore, class but also “linked to race, certainly,” as she explicitly stated that prior education has racial connotations for her when imagining student-author identity.</p>
<p>The indexical patterns described above offer an opportunity to examine the co-occurring ideologies of SLI and Whiteness. SLI creates the assumption that all “good” schools offer access to SEAE (at the sentence and text levels) and all students who have access to SEAE will use it because it is better and desirable. Whiteness creates the assumption that White students are from a higher SES and have gone to better schools. Whiteness also affixes standardness with White people (or, worse, equates standardness with White) and makes other identities, particularly those in opposition to White—in this case, African American—incongruent with the standard (see also work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741088312438691">Delpit, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741088312438691">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741088312438691">Hartigan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088312438691">McLaren, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741088312438691">Nakayama &amp; Krizek, 1995</xref>). SLI and Whiteness, then, work in tandem to perpetuate the belief that SEAE is widely accessible and not affiliated with any one group of people but also less accessible to certain marginalized groups and incongruent with African American language use. These ideologies functionally prohibit indexical patterns that would allow African American students to be linked with anything other than negatively valued nonstandardness. Instead, the enduring indexical patterns continue to privilege White middle- to upper-middle-class students <italic>at the expense of</italic> students of color—in this case, African American students.</p>
<p>These enduring patterns associated with race, class, and standardness are so powerful that they influenced instructors’ reception of texts and even perceptions of standardness. Once instructors had a perceived author in mind, which happened as early as the first sentence of a paper, it changed the way that they interpreted textual features in the student’s text—a kind of “reverse” indexicality. According to a study by Piché, Rubin, Turner, and Michlin in 1978,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>writing evaluators are not always accurate in discerning the actual social identities of writers. But if they decide (for any reason, plausible or not) that a particular writer is a member of a socially stigmatized group, then they are more likely to perceive the writing as nonstandard and error-laden. (quoted in Rubin, 1996, p. 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The findings from this study align with those of Piché et al. In addition, this study shows the opposite to be true as well. When instructors imagined a privileged student-author, they sometimes overlooked errors and often interpreted difference as mistakes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0741088312438691">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Take, for example, Nate’s response to a text that he perceived as having been written by a highly privileged author: “a person from the upper middle or upper class . . . a person who went to a good school . . . very cultured.” Nate stated, “I find it interesting how many little errors I missed in Paper H because of its authority [<italic>laughter</italic>]. Like, I’m, I’m willing to forgive like an extra ‘to’ and a, the lost ‘n’ in an ‘and’ because it just seems like it’s in charge.” The identity that Nate imagined for the author of Paper H worked to redefine standardness, making projected authority and tone more important than the organization and development of the argument, and positioned the sentence-level difference as “lazy” mistakes as opposed to features of nonstandardness.</p>
<p>For many instructors determining whether nonstandard grammatical features are errors or mistakes was an integral, but not always easy, component in the construction of student-author identities, as well as the source of some indexical conflict. Henry articulated the difficulty of this process: “I don’t know until I start talking to the student whether they just left out words because they were writing so quickly and it was so late or whether there’s actual syntax, there’s actually problems with sentence construction.” Whether Henry decides that the missing word in a student’s paper is a mistake or a problem with sentence construction likely has implications for the way that he imagines the student. If Henry follows the indexical patterns in this study, determining that the missing word is an error could lead him to picture an African American student and/or a student from a lower SES (or possibly that the student is an English-as-a-second-language learner). In contrast, if the missing word is a mistake, he might imagine a White student from a middle- or upper-middle-class background. In the example above, Henry did ultimately decide that the missing word was a mistake; however, he did so because he first turned to other markers to create an identity profile that influenced his interpretation of the grammatical “issue.” Henry stated, “My male, jock student, this [missing word] kind of fits with that. I guess maybe that would make me assume more this was just kind of the writing quickly.” He imagined the student preoccupied with sports to the point where he did not allow enough time to write and properly proofread his English paper. In this instance, Henry used his identity profile for the student as a guide for reading the missing word as a mistake. This example of interpreting the cause for a missing word again illustrates the bidirectionality of indexicality: Language use can create identities just as identities can change the way that we receive and interpret language use. Additionally, perceptions of standardness (related to the “myth of linguistic homogeneity” as well as SLI and Whiteness) can contribute to the creation of identities just as perceptions of identities can contribute to the reception of standardness. Better understanding indexicality, then, can allow for better understanding of standardness, or SEAE.</p>

<title>Allowable Identities: The Implications of Enduring Indexical Patterns</title>
<p>This article argues that examining the indexicality of SEAE can uncover often-hidden ideologies of standardness and privilege, reveal enduring indexical patterns, and add complexity to composition studies’ conversations about the (existing and ideal) role of SEAE in composition courses. In particular, this article has demonstrated that instructors relied on their perceptions of written standardness for indexical clues, a finding that aligns with Matsuda and Tardy’s research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741088312438691">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741088312438691">Tardy &amp; Matsuda, 2009</xref>). Additionally, the analysis of this data suggests that because indexicality is bidirectional, instructors are more likely to perceive discursive difference as an error if they believe that the author is an African American or as a mistake if they believe that the author is White. This reverse indexicality works to justify existing stereotypes.</p>
<p>Given the indexical patterns revealed in this study, it seems clear not only that identity is a part of the reception of student texts but also that there are limited recognizable identities based on instructors’ experiences and compelling ideologies about SEAE and privilege. Indeed, there are few allowable identities that can be associated with standardness in this study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741088312438691">McCarthey and Moje (2002)</xref> asserted that literacy practices can limit our identity representations and reception, particularly when the range of acceptable literacy practices is constrained within a given context (p. 231). In this case, the strong expectation for SEAE in academic contexts—the “myth of linguistic homogeneity”—is likely one limiting factor for possible identity representations and, to the point of this article, <italic>the reception of identity</italic>.</p>
<p>The concept of linguistic profiling—of making often negative assumptions about people and their identities based on their language use—is central to my research interests. However, this project also reveals the importance of the opposite, the potentially unearned positive evaluations associated with particular dialects and discursive features. In particular, the findings from this study show a strong link between SEAE and the White race and middle- to upper-middle SES, suggesting that SEAE is a raced and classed social dialect. Even though there is no inherent link between race and dialect, when one dialect is both “read” as White and deemed more acceptable than other dialects, it becomes raced in the reader’s mind and perpetuates Whiteness. Furthermore, as this study shows, racialized language use also racializes language users; however, Whiteness and SLI mask this process by simultaneously racializing SEAE and arguing that SEAE is unaffiliated. SLI provides the justification and logic necessary to buy into the existence and value of “the” standard, and Whiteness allows instructors to both acknowledge a link between “good” writing and already privileged students (based on class and race) and remove themselves from either blame or responsibility for finding a solution for this unequal power system.</p>
<p>Clearly, the stakes surrounding SEAE and identity are high. This research suggests that gatekeeping associated with SEAE, then, is not only a result of insisting that academic writing be produced in SEAE but is connected to the reception of and indexicality associated with non/standardness. Traditionally underrepresented students may be held at a distance from academia due to their language use <italic>and</italic> due to the fact that there are no allowable identities that are linked to standardness and representative of their various social groups.</p>
<p>This study, however, is just a starting point. The findings from this project raise many more questions than they answer. In particular, it begs the following questions: How does the indexicality change in geographic regions of different racial distribution and with readers from other races, and how does the reverse indexicality change when instructors know more about the student (from knowing a name, having a picture, or even having the students in their class)? For now, though, I end with a call to the composition community to both acknowledge and resist the enduring and troubling indexicality of SEAE within individual practices and scholarship—to allow more successful identities into our classrooms and research.</p>

<label>1.</label>
<p>Although commonly referred to as standard English or, simply, English, I follow the lead of <italic>Students’ Right to Their Own Language</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741088312438691">Conference on College Composition and Communication, 1974</xref>) and Lisa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741088312438691">Delpit (1996)</xref>, adding “edited” to indicate that this language variety is both written and no one’s primary dialect—though, it is more similar to some primary dialects than others. Furthermore, including “American” acknowledges the many World Englishes that also have standard varieties.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0741088312438691">
<label>2.</label>
<p>The term “enduring patterns” comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741088312438691">Wortham’s (2001)</xref> description of indexicality as “enduring identities” resulting from individuals “position[ing] [them]selves and others in characteristic ways” through language (p. 256). This research looks not only at “enduring identities” but also at the enduring indexical patterns that connect language to identity.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0741088312438691">
<label>3.</label>
<p>In this project, I rely heavily on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741088312438691">Bucholtz and Hall’s (2005)</xref> definition of identity, which accounts for both “the social positioning of self and other” (p. 586) and the ways in which these means of identification and marking are “constituted in linguistic interaction” (p. 585). Their definition suggests that identity is a relational process located within a discursive context.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0741088312438691">
<label>4.</label>
<p>The 25% of undergraduate students who do not identify as White are not separated by race. According to the Midwestern University website, these students are “African American, Hispanic American, Native American, or Asian American.”</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0741088312438691">
<label>5.</label>
<p>There is considerable crossover between these levels of language use and the categories I use to organize them. Tone, for example, is an issue of audience awareness and academic conventions. Furthermore, it is a language feature related to diction and can affect grammar and usage.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0741088312438691">
<label>6.</label>
<p>While I offer Melissa’s quotation as an example of enduring racist and classist indexical patterns, all of the instructors in this study perpetuated these beliefs and patterns to varying degrees.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0741088312438691">
<label>7.</label>
<p>The distinction between error and mistake rests on a student’s knowledge of rules. If students know a language rule but inadvertently do not follow it (a typo, e.g.), the misuse of language is a mistake. However, if a student is unaware of the rule or is following a different set of rules that are not recognized in that particular context, it would be considered an error.</p>
