<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Cancer is a challenging disease to diagnose and treat, and oftentimes even with the best medical intervention, it spreads and is deemed incurable, requiring a shift from cure to end-of-life care. This study used a spirituality measure and the PATS© storytelling intervention developed by the principal investigator to better understand the experience of being diagnosed with cancer and being told no further curative treatments are warranted. <bold>Purpose:</bold> The purpose of this exploratory study was to implement a storytelling approach to explore the experience of living with terminal cancer. Second, the study documented the presence of spirituality and healing in the narratives. <bold>Method:</bold> The qualitative data were analyzed by narrative analysis developed by Riessman. <bold>Findings:</bold> Seven synoptic stories were written and later sorted into healing categories. The narrative analysis yielded three themes. There were instances of religion and spirituality found in the transcribed stories. The participants’ scores on the Spiritual Health Inventory indicated the presence of spirituality. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Storytelling allowed the seven study participants to share personal experiences and achieve a sense of connectedness and intimacy. The use of the PATS© intervention is a way to facilitate physical, emotional, and spiritual healing and provide holistic end-of-life care.</p>

<body>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010111418116">Murray et al. (2010)</xref> state that individuals dying from cancer experience distress, particularly at four key time points: at diagnosis, at home after initial treatment, at recurrence, and during the terminal stage. Individuals diagnosed with cancer are sometimes informed that their condition is terminal and no additional curative treatment is recommended. Under the best circumstances, people living with terminal cancer are provided supportive care meant to alleviate their pain, suffering, and other incapacitating symptoms of this disease. The goal of health care for these individuals is to provide end-of-life care rather than continuing efforts to cure the disease. When curing of the disease is no longer an option, the emphasis on healing and the transition to death is critical. End-of-life care strives to be holistic in its approach. Although medical and nursing interventions provide physical and emotional comfort, spiritual comfort is often neglected or relegated to the clergy or pastoral counseling. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010111418116">Moadel et al. (1999)</xref> indicated that spiritual care is an area in which patients who have cancer want help. Spiritual support is a key element in ameliorating the anxiety that accompanies the dying person’s awareness of constricted time and also plays an important role in pain management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010111418116">Georgesen &amp; Dungan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010111418116">Hall, 1998</xref>). Spiritual support assists patients in finding a sense of peace and in gaining some control over the fear of dying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010111418116">Hall, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Healing is viewed both as a process and an outcome or object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010111418116">Cowling, 2006</xref>) that is grounded in wholeness and within the lived experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010111418116">Kritek, 1997</xref>). Healing is a lifelong process of self-awareness, growth, and transformation that becomes evident in illness and disease. Healing can also occur through the nearing death experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010111418116">Burkhardt &amp; Nagai-Jacobson, 2002</xref>). Nurses can facilitate healing by recognizing the importance of the unresolved issues and by encouraging communication about residual feelings related to such concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010111418116">Lucas, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Caring for people in the terminal stage of illness requires a holistic framework that makes apparent the integration of mind, body, and spirit. Nurses and other health care providers routinely provide excellent physical care. Emotional care is provided although nurses might feel reluctant to talk to a dying person or to listen to their concerns. Sometimes the nurse’s discomfort is experienced as not knowing what to say. Occurring more frequently, however, is the reality that nurses provide minimal spiritual care. Although spiritual care is mandated as a part of every patient’s treatment plan, these authors believe that it is even more critical at the end of life. This study examined the role of spirituality in the healing of persons with terminal cancer. This emphasis does not neglect the need for the usual standard of care and builds on the assumption that patients will receive the best physical and emotional care possible during the dying process. The study incorporates the core aspects of spiritual caregiving with the qualitative research approach of narrative analysis.</p>
<p>The threefold purpose of the study is to (a) explore the acceptability and feasibility of implementing the PATS© (Presence, Active Listening, Touch, Sacred Story) intervention, an approach to narrative storytelling developed by the first author/principal investigator, and the administration of Spiritual Health Inventory (SHI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010111418116">Highfield, 1992</xref>) in a sample of people who have a terminal diagnosis of cancer; (b) explore the experience of living with a terminal illness as expressed in the narratives of the sacred stories of the study participants that results from PATS; and (c) analyze the sacred stories for the presence and nature of spirituality and healing.</p>
<sec id="section1-0898010111418116">
<title>Research Design and Procedures</title>
<p>Participants living with terminal cancer were invited to tell their stories in this exploratory intervention study. The study was designed to gather qualitative data in the form of sacred stories and quantitative responses to a short survey. Details of the study’s method and procedures are described in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="section2-0898010111418116">
<title>Research Settings and Study Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>The study included a convenience sample of patients diagnosed with terminal cancer and admitted to the palliative care unit (PCU) at a large teaching hospital and a community hospice program in a Mid-Atlantic U.S. state. The average length of stay on the PCU was 5.4 days. Fifteen adults at both sites met the study criteria and were eligible to participate in the study. The participants were referred to the investigators by the staff as meeting the following study criteria: 18 years old and older, confirmed cancer diagnosis, patient informed of terminal illness status, a “do not resuscitate” order documented on the patient’s chart, stability of condition (stable vital signs, a prescribed pain regimen that allows conversing and no indication of imminent death), client is not pregnant, no diagnosis of cerebral malignancy and/or cranial radiation, and has the ability to communicate in the English language. The human subject panel at the principal investigator’s university approved the initial study and subsequent amendments, that is, a second site and a coinvestigator.</p>

<title>Study Intervention</title>
<p>The principal author, engaged in research on the topic of spirituality and healing for over a decade and familiar with a large volume of related literature, surmised that there were critical elements of spiritual care. The PATS intervention, developed by the principal investigator, is an acronym for the innovative integration of four selected core elements: Presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010111418116">Baillie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010111418116">Charles, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010111418116">Davidhizar, Bechtel, &amp; Cosey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010111418116">Golberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010111418116">Harrison, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010111418116">Iseminger, Levitt, &amp; Kirk, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010111418116">Laukhuf &amp; Werner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898010111418116">Nelms, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010111418116">Nouwen, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010111418116">Parse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010111418116">Sumner, 1998</xref>), Active listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010111418116">Conco, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010111418116">Laukhuf &amp; Werner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898010111418116">Tuck, Pullen, &amp; Wallace, 2001</xref>), Touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010111418116">Georgesen &amp; Dungan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010111418116">Hover-Kramer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898010111418116">Smucker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898010111418116">Tuck et al., 2001</xref>), and Sacred story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111418116">Burkhardt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898010111418116">Ross, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898010111418116">Taylor, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898010111418116">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898010111418116">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>PATS occurs within the dyadic interaction between the client and provider/interviewer with the intent of responding to spiritual needs. As indicated, the essential elements of the intervention include the facilitation of therapeutic presence, active listening, and physical and emotional touch by the interviewer while the participant crafts his or her story. The prescribed approaches to these elements are grounded in the literature and are detailed in the intervention protocol. The PATS intervention assumes that the therapeutic process of telling one’s story under the best circumstances will facilitate healing and affect the quality of the end-of-life experience. Although PATS is similar to other approaches to storytelling, the preparation done by the interviewer prior to the session, and the activities intended to create a sacred space for the story to be told, makes it a spiritual intervention. The intervention requires the provider, and in this case, the interviewer, to develop the human connections that are essential to providing spiritual care that facilitates healing. Healing is not synonymous with curing of the disease process and is appropriate for this sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898010111418116">
<title>Theoretical Support for Components of the Intervention</title>
<p>PATS is built on the four core elements of presence, active listening, therapeutic use of touch, and sacred story. First of all, presence is central to the PATS approach and is essential to providing holistic care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010111418116">Iseminger et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010111418116">Parse (1995)</xref> contends that true presence is a special way of being with the other that recognizes that the other’s values and priorities are what are most important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898010111418116">Rushton et al. (2009)</xref> describe contemplative practices as a way to achieve presence. To accomplish true presence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010111418116">Parse (1995)</xref> says that the nurse (provider) must center with the universe, prepare and approach the other, and attend intensely to the meaning of the moment being lived by that person. She believes that true presence is an invitation for the person to explore the depths of ideas, issues, or events in the way that he or she chooses. The process of being present focuses on the person’s thoughts and feelings about people, ideas, objects, or events in the moment of coming together with the nurse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010111418116">Parse, 1995</xref>). “The nurse takes what the person . . . says or does as the meaning of the situation and moves with the person . . . without judging, labeling, or specifying a nurse-generated change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010111418116">Parse, 1995</xref>, p. 82). Parse’s principle related to illuminating meaning becomes a feature of the sacred story.</p>
<p>Second, there has been much written concerning effective communication and active listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010111418116">Conco, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010111418116">Laukhuf &amp; Werner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010111418116">Newshan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898010111418116">Townsend, 1996</xref>) and deep listening at the end of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898010111418116">Seno, 2010</xref>). The human spirit is something sacred, to be respected and honored, and when the nurse listens sincerely, he or she affirms this fact. When listening to a patient, the nurse pays attention not only to the patient’s words but also to his or her voice tone and body language. The nurse strives to enter the patient’s world while listening with the eyes, heart, and spirit as well as mind and ears. This kind of listening is not possible without the accompanying concepts of presence and acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010111418116">Newshan, 1998</xref>). Active listening, therapeutic listening, and/or attentive listening were the techniques used in this study.</p>
<p>The third element of the intervention is classified as “contact” or “noncontact” touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010111418116">Fredriksson, 1999</xref>). Contact or physical touch involves skin-to-skin contact, whereas noncontact refers to eye contact or facial expressions. Both contact touch and noncontact touch may be further defined as task-oriented, caring, and protective touch. Caring touch (also referred to as positive affective touch, expressive touch, nonprocedural touch, comforting touch, and nonnecessary touch) is a form of nonverbal communication. The outcomes of caring touch have been identified as comfort, security, enhancement of self-esteem, and reality orientation and also include creating a connection with the patient. Caring touch has primarily communicative functions. A nurse may gain permission to enter a patient’s personal space first by talking and then by talking and touching. Caring touch communicates acceptance of the patient as a unique person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010111418116">Fredriksson, 1999</xref>). The PATS intervention is designed to use “caring touch,” which may or may not include physical touch.</p>
<p>Finally, the essential feature of the intervention is the telling of the sacred story described in two parts: sacredness and storytelling. Qualitative research seeks to ground the self in the sense of the sacred, to embed the self in sacred space, and illuminate the self in relation to the sacred world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010111418116">Lincoln &amp; Denzin, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010111418116">Burkhardt and Nagai-Jacobson (2002)</xref> state that “with our presence we create a sacred space in which every thought, word, or act makes evident the spiritual in the encounter” (p. 39). PATS uses a qualitative narrative approach that fosters the sense of the sacred to solicit the participant’s stories.</p>
<p>Stories provide a method for organizing and shaping human experience and thought. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898010111418116">Taylor, Highfield, and Amenta (1999)</xref>, stories allow individuals to reflect and observe their experience and to make sense of their experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898010111418116">Taylor et al. (1999)</xref> encouraged storytelling as an intervention that can be used by nurses to promote spiritual health. Storytelling allows “for the sequencing and a connection of various elements of life experiences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898010111418116">Taylor et al., 1999</xref>, p. 252) and brings about “emotional catharsis and instills hope” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010111418116">Chelf, Deshler, Hillman, &amp; Durazo-Arvizu, 2000</xref>, p. 2). Storytelling promotes spiritual well-being and allows the translation of distress into language that ultimately allows us to forget or to move beyond the experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010111418116">Pennebaker &amp; Seagal, 1999</xref>). The act of storytelling allows an individual to share personal experiences with another; it is a mechanism for achieving connectedness and intimacy. Stories of personal experiences are reports of a sequence of events that have entered into the biography of the speaker by a sequence of clauses that correspond to the order of the original events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010111418116">Labov, 1997</xref>). Events that have entered into the speaker’s story are emotionally and socially evaluated and are therefore now transformed from the raw experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010111418116">Labov, 1997</xref>). The intervention was conducted in a prescribed manner to ensure consistency across all participants. The protocol is based on the authors’ preunderstandings that the act of storytelling itself becomes a spiritual intervention with possible healing effects even when a prognosis for physical recovery is poor.</p>

<title>Study Instrument and Operational Definitions</title>
<p>On admission to the study, the SHI was administered and a second administration of the survey was scheduled for 5 days later. The SHI was selected because of its prior use with cancer patients. The SHI, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010111418116">Highfield (1992)</xref>, measures spiritual health in the three areas of self-acceptance, relationships, and hope. Highfield also reported content and construct validity based on the literature, an expert panel review, and factor analysis. Reliability was reported with the Cronbach alpha of <italic>r</italic> = .77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010111418116">Highfield, 1992</xref>). It is estimated that 20 minutes is required for completion of the SHI, and in this study, the instrument could be completed in several short sessions if needed. The primary reason for the inclusion of the study instrument was to have a self-report measure of the participants’ level of spiritual health. Secondarily, it was important to explore participants’ tolerance for completion of the instrument based on their physical condition and to determine the sensitivity of the instrument to change over a short time frame.</p>
<p>Operational definitions for categories of healing were proposed to classify the participant’s stories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898010111418116">Table 1</xref>). These four categories were developed by the principal author and are based on the concepts of transformation, integration, and restoration found in the healing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010111418116">Goddard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010111418116">Kritek, 2000</xref>). This classification of healing was reviewed by three experts, individuals familiar with this content area, and was deemed reasonable and appropriate.</p>

<p><disp-quote><p>I would like for you to tell me about your experience of having cancer and finding out that there are no options available for future treatment or a cure. Your sharing the experience is very significant and for us becomes a sacred story. Please describe for me what this experience has been like for you and what impact it has had on you as a person today.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>If at the conclusion of the story, the following topics have not been included, the interviewer will probe by asking further questions: What about spirituality? How would you describe spirituality or your spiritual journey? Was your sacred story a way to describe your spirituality? Was healing a part of your experience? How do you see yourself in terms of change or growth?</p>
<p>Data collection for the study was conducted over a period of several months. Initially, the interviews were conducted in the PCU by the principal investigator and later in homes as a second site by a doctoral student, enrolled in a research practicum and trained in the protocol. A major challenge of the study was obtaining informed consent in a timely way that allowed time for an interview before the patient was discharged or their condition changed. Thirteen of the 15 eligible participants agreed to be interviewed. Two potential participants’ conditions worsened, and they were no longer able to communicate their consent. Three persons were discharged from the PCU before the interview could be conducted, and three declined later to the interview because either this was not the “right” time to talk or their families were uncomfortable with the topic. A sample of seven participants was realized. The stories were transcribed verbatim for later narrative analysis. Demographic data were obtained from a chart review as part of determining eligibility for the study.</p>
<p>The SHI was administered prior to the intervention in the enrollment session after consent was obtained and was proposed to be readministered on the fifth day of the study period. The brief length of stay, changes in patients’ condition, and discharge procedures made the second administration possible in only three cases, and therefore, these data are excluded from analysis. Participants completed the instrument independently prior to the intervention, or if their condition did not allow, the investigators read the items to participants and recorded their responses. The inability to collect data at the second time interval did not allow for the determination of differences in the SHI scores overtime; however, initial scores do indicate self-reported spiritual health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0898010111418116">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The sample demographics were summarized with frequencies and percentages. The SHI was scored for each of the participants, and the mean group score was derived from these results. There was no further statistical analysis done to determine the differences in scores over the two time intervals because of the small sample size and the inability to administer the instrument postintervention to most of the participants. Participants were asked to tell their sacred story using the PATS protocol and, when possible, to answer open-ended evaluative questions about the intervention on the final day of the study period. Again, all participants did not have an opportunity for a follow-up visit, and responses to the open-ended evaluative questions were not consistently available in sufficient number to warrant analysis.</p>
<p>The sacred stories as told by the participants were audiotaped and transcribed according to the protocol. Data from the sacred stories were analyzed using the narrative technique described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898010111418116">Riessman (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898010111418116">2007)</xref>. The story was a representation of the meaning made of the experience by each participant. The team of investigators read each transcript of the sacred story. The construction of each story was reviewed by the team of investigators and a brief story synopsis was created for each participant. Furthermore, a line-by-line analysis of the transcripts yielded themes that were summarized to provide an exhaustive description of the experience. In the second-level analysis, the investigators reread the transcripts to determine if the a priori categories of healing and content related to spirituality were evident in the words of the participants. The investigators attempted to categorize the healing type based on the operational definitions proposed by the principal investigator for each story.</p>

<sec id="section8-0898010111418116">
<title>Study Findings</title>
<p>Of the seven participants who consented to be in the study and completed the PATS interviews, four were males, three female, five were admitted to the PCU, and two were hospice patients. The mean age was 59.5 years. Three were African American; four were Caucasian. Six reported Protestant religion or nondenomination as their religious preference, and all were discharged to their home or to a relative’s home. The SHI scores in this sample ranged from 109 to 140, and the average score was 122.5. The SHI has a range of scores from 31 to 155. This sample SHI scores indicate a moderately high level of spiritual health for each participant prior to telling his or her sacred stories.</p>
<p>The first study aim was to explore the acceptability and feasibility of implementing the PATS intervention and the administration of SHI in a sample of people who have a terminal diagnosis of cancer. The PATS intervention was partially accepted and deemed feasible with modifications. Thirteen of 15 people agreed to participate in the study, and those who refused or withdrew did so for a variety of reasons. Family reluctance to discuss the finality of death was the primary reason for refusing to participate. The lack of congruence and timing between the participant’s and family’s perception of the “inevitable truth” is probably irreconcilable and may remain a limitation of this type of study. Although hospice care provided more stability in scheduling and there were more resolved family concerns, patients’ conditions worsened and interviews could not be rescheduled in this setting as well. Disruption in the flow of interviews due to staff interruptions was an issue in the PCU. Often personnel in this academic medical center needed to enter the room for treatment issues although the door was closed and the staff had been notified of the ongoing interview. The interviews with the hospice patients were easier to conduct with fewer interruptions. It was helpful in both sites to conduct the interviews in several sessions of 20 to 30 minutes over 8 to 24 hours (that same day or as soon as possible the following day) to allow participants to rest if requested. Flexibility on the part of the interviewer was necessary to be available for subsequent interviews.</p>
<p>The second part of this aim was to explore the feasibility of administering the SHI at two time intervals. The participants’ pretest SHI scores indicated a moderate level of spiritual health even when physical health was at its worst outcome. These scores support the idea that health is not unidimensional and give credence to the presence of spirituality at the time of the interviews. The physical condition of the participants or their early discharge allowed only 43% of the sample to complete the instrument for a second time, which indicates questionable feasibility of the second administration. The three scores were 101, 109, and 142 with less than 7 points variation between the two time periods. Because of missing data, there were no further efforts made to determine differences between the scores at preadministration and postadministration of the survey or to make further comment on the use of the SHI. Thus, methodological questions remain: whether or not spiritual health is amenable to change in a short time period, is the SHI sensitive to measuring such change, or whether or not storytelling as an intervention could affect such change.</p>
<p>The major findings related to the second aim, the participants’ end-of-life experiences, are reported as synoptic stories and thematic analysis. The results of the study provide positive support for the third aim as the presence of spirituality and healing is well documented.</p>
<sec id="section9-0898010111418116">
<title>Participants’ Synoptic Stories</title>
<p>Using the steps of narrative analysis previously described, seven synoptic sacred stories that captured the essence of the experience for the participants were written by the principal investigator and the research team. Pseudonyms were used, and minor details changed to protect the identity of study participants. Many of the exact words of the participants were used in the stories to reflect their personal style and portray their character. The synopses were written to capture the nuances of their speaking dialect and their use of metaphors for their life experiences. The variations in the storylines follow the approach used in the storytelling process. An iterative process of reading and reflection was used to closely align the content, structure, and flow of the synopsis to the sacred story. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898010111418116">Table 2</xref> includes excerpts from the participants’ sacred stories.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Participant 1, Rhonda</td>
<td>Rhonda’s story is a narrative of struggling in a 10-year saga of living with breast cancer in which she faced a delay in diagnosis and treatment, treatment disappointments, and questioning of self and God. She describes her day as a roller coaster or a “topsy turvy” day. Initially, she felt shock when she was shown the mammogram with questionable findings and later disbelief upon hearing that a second mammogram displayed early signs of cancer. When the mastectomy was done, she felt that her feminine energy was now gone and the outcome of the surgery was not as she desired. She was not pleased with the breast reconstruction and felt that her breasts were no longer “normal looking.” She questions her decisions and feels that the disease is not in her control. In the midst of her tale of struggle, there are moments when she expresses her strong belief in God and prays to find confidence. “I keep praying about it and that’s all I can do. . . . Just you know, just faith, the things that, you know I’ve always kept the faith.” She describes Chapter 1 of her life as looking at the outside from the inside and for her; Chapter 2 is looking at new knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Participant 2, Sandra</td>
<td>Sandra tells a story of breast cancer that veers her off of health. Her narrative starts with her struggle with her faith. She sees her health also as a struggle. Life is more difficult and there are disruptions in her ability to care for herself. There are disruptions in her normal patterns. “This is a hurdle, but this old hurdle it’s not like previously. I’m really struggling to get on with this hurdle.” She prays a lot for strength and realizes that the illness is taking another direction. She is struggling to find words to tell others and is looking at the reality of her situation and recognizes that she can’t delay telling them. She names the “it” later in the narrative and talks about hearing the diagnosis of cancer like being hit with a “ton of bricks” or a “bolt of lightning.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Participant 3, Anna Marie</td>
<td>Anne Marie starts her story with the frustration of not knowing and feeling scared. There was a long time between diagnosis and the start of treatment. She responds to the requests of the impersonal “they” and with an unmentioned disease. Frustration came with each new symptom and treatment. She wears a public face that hides a sense of inner frustration and her attempts to keep steady. She expresses a personal relationship with God and professes to live in the spirit. The relationship with God and others is important. Her relationship with others is becoming more challenging as others are pushing more and getting on her nerves. She states I handle it by “talking to God” and “trying to keep breathing.” She believes that nobody can realize what it is like to have cancer and no one understands. Everything has felt “un-normal” and she makes efforts to reclaim normalcy and wonders if it is possible. She sees the disease as a burden and out of her control. The hospital is “a waiting place.” In the midst of the frustration, which cloaks her fears, she states that God and others help her sometimes. Her story ends with her frustration of not being able to walk and her impending loss of independence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Participant 4, Don</td>
<td>Don has a story of acceptance and laughter. He begins by saying that being told was no shock to him because he was an old man and has lived a good life. “Everyone has to die.” “I will spend my time doing more fishing.” He describes that he was more scared by the stroke that happened when he was 59. At that time, there was a great fear that he could not live like he wanted to live. So with the diagnosis of lung cancer, he refused treatment after thinking about it and hearing the stories told by others. He placed himself in hospice care for the “6 months remaining” that now has become 4 years. He laughs a deep soulful laugh and he states that there are no guarantees in life. He feels bad at times and is so sick that he can’t hold his head up and wants it over with. Sometimes the pain is intolerable but he comments that it doesn’t stay long and that he is so blessed. “I’ve done everything that I ever wanted to do.” His obituary is written, the burial plot bought for himself, his wife, and son, and the tombstone engraved and in the garage. There is much laughter and teasing with his wife and with the nurses. There is no questioning of God and no ambivalence voiced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Participant 5, Harry</td>
<td>Harry was confronted suddenly with the diagnosis at age 48 and made the decision to fight for his survival. On the 10th of July, he fell on his deck and couldn’t get up. Later that day when he went to the hospital, they told him that he has cancer of the spine that had metastasized from his lungs. He remembers the physician rattling off the information as he sat and took in the information in bits and pieces. He decided then that he was not going to throw in the towel. “I put my best foot on; I mean I’m not go give up.” “Everyday when you wake up, you got a little bit of something left in you, give it. . . . I’m going to fight back with it. It’s too easy to give up.” He doesn’t blame his bosses for the solvents at the print company where he worked. He heard the diagnosis and began to think and believes that you can get your thoughts and mind settled in a way to handle this disease. There are many stories of triumph over cancer and heart failure in his immediate family and he believes that his family has a “hard will for survival.” He has a strong faith and believes that God determines all things. “I always say if you don’t have nothing to believe in you don’t have nothing.” “Get up, do a little walking, do a little fishing.” He offers, “When you start to loose your spiritual part and your thinking part, that is, can really play hard on you.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Participant 6, Jasper</td>
<td>Jasper starts his story with his arrival at the hospital with swollen legs and after the examination being told that he has prostate cancer. He did know that this type of cancer existed and clearly did not know that 50-year-old Black males are at greater risk for the disease. After several months of treatment, he was told 2 days ago that he has 6 months to live. He thinks that God is trying to tell him something. Although he has been traveling around the country since his mom’s death, he has never forgotten God. He was raised in the church and now was returning to receive God’s grace and mercy. His story is one of women, drugs, and associating with “the acts of the devil.” He states that over time he “slipped away,” “always slipping away from the church.” He knows to take one day at a time and to ask God for forgiveness. He says that God is in control and is everywhere, “He’s the boss.” He reviews his life in terms of good and evil and believes that the confusion and the wickedness he often experienced were brought on by his choices. He has continued his prescribed treatments and supplemented them with alternative herbal care to back them up. “I just trying to survive, trying to take care of myself in this, in this world.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Participant 7, Madelyn</td>
<td>Madelyn was told 2 weeks ago that there “wasn’t a chance that I would survive” and her response was “I don’t want to leave them.” “I have too much to do.” She recently obtained custody of a 10-year old child that is a daughter of a relative who has several other children and many problems. She wants to bring closure to her affairs and make sure that everything is right. Making things right is a recurring theme. In her rambling, she reveals a family journey that is tumultuous, filled with violence and abuse, betrayals, and tragedy, while sharing contrasting anecdotes of love and joy when describing the times spent during her recent illness with her newly adopted daughter and granddaughter. They have become a source of strength. She talks about finding the lump in her breast, having the mammogram done and completing her treatments, and going into remission for 2 years only to be followed a year later with additional chemo and radiation. She cried for several days when she heard the diagnosis. She was told recently that the cancer has spread to her bones. She ends her story with a series of affirmations: “Some strong willed women and men in my family.” “I got to finish doing what I got to do . . . And that’s gonna be it,” “I’m, a pusher.” “It [courage and strength] just runs in my family.”</td>

<title>Thematic Analysis</title>
<p>The narrative analysis of the stories as told by the participants included three themes: <italic>finding out and struggling, discovering what it means</italic>, and <italic>living with the prognosis</italic>. The theme of <italic>finding out and struggling</italic> included the prolonged process of diagnosis before the words of cancer are spoken. Shock and disbelief, sadness, anger, loss, disappointment, outrage, loss of control, and hurt are a few of the emotions reported as part of the struggle. Frustration was frequently expressed. The theme, <italic>discovering what it means</italic>, reflects the impact of the diagnosis. This is followed by a profound response as participants wrestled with what the diagnosis meant. It hit them like a “ton of bricks” or “bolt of lightning” and became a “back and forth” continuing story. Coping or <italic>living with</italic> the diagnosis and later the prognosis required internal and external work. Internally, individuals told themselves to “keep a positive attitude,” “just grin and bear it,” “take one day at a time,” and “make the best of it.” Personal characteristics came to the forefront as well: “I’m a fighter, I won’t give up,” “Gotta keep going,” or “I’m a pusher.” <italic>Living with</italic> was also expressed through connections with others. Family and peer relationships offered the opportunity to weigh and consider options, to search for answers, to stay connected, and to talk with others. The third part of living with the disease was the work done in relationship with God: “God knows best,” “Keeping the faith,” “God will show me the way,” and “Handing it over to God.” The roller-coaster emotions experienced with the initial diagnosis reoccurred when they were told that there was nothing left to be done. The cycle was repeated but with a sense that “but this is a different direction.” The essence of the experience was stories of lives forever changed by the diagnosis of cancer that affected each person physically, psychologically, emotionally, and spiritually.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0898010111418116">
<title>Presence of Spirituality and Healing</title>
<p>The third aim of the study was achieved by specifically seeking evidence of spirituality/religion and healing in the sacred stories by using content analysis, a way to distill the essence of content. The investigators used a line-by-line analysis to glean content related to spirituality and religion. The stories included strong statements that indicated the search for meaning and purpose usually associated with spirituality. The spiritual references were interspersed throughout the stories, were participant initiated, and not at the end of the narrative prompted by the interviewer. All seven stories referenced a deep and often tumultuous relationship with God and connections with family.</p>
<p>Finally, the synopsis of each narrative was classified according to one of the categories of healing. The investigators read the story in their entirety several times and wrote memos describing the sense of the whole story. The transcripts were reviewed and categories of healing were assigned. All seven interviews were easily categorized based on the investigators subjective interpretation of the stories. The findings indicated that there were two disintegrative healing stories as told by two female participants (Rhonda and Sandra), three restorative healing stories as related by two females and one male participant (Anna Marie, Madelyn, and Harry), one integrative healing story told by a male (Jasper), and, finally, one male transformative healing story (Don). Although one category was identified for each participant, there were glimpses of growth and positive changes noted in all cases, even the two classified as examples of disintegrative healing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This exploratory study offered the opportunity to implement the PATS intervention with a sample of persons living with a terminal cancer diagnosis. The sacred stories were rich and captured the nuances of the experience. Sacred stories had unique qualities; however, the derived themes were found in each narrative. The richness of the stories offers insight to those who work closely with this population regarding compassionate care and ethical and legal decisions. Although the participants shared a diagnosis and prognosis and had similar health care encounters, the four types of healing were discernable in the stories. There is no evidence to indicate that particular characteristics of the sample bound an individual to a specific healing type as there were a range of responses. The inclusion criteria required the shared experience of living with a terminal illness. The prognosis became the second chapter and the determinate of a healing type near the end of life. In this study, there was no support for controlling for length of time since the initial diagnosis. Healing type might be the consequence of a general worldview, personality type, or one’s life experience. The healing classifications created for this study required thoughtful reflection of the essence of the sacred stories by these investigators and might be viewed differently by others or at another time. Future studies may provide more definitive answers.</p>
<p>In terms of the feasibility of full implementation of the protocol, there were several strengths noted. When there was an opportunity to have a follow-up interview, there were verbal reports that it helped to talk and have someone listen to their stories. The steps taken to create a safe environment and to be fully present, an active listener, and “in touch” with the participants were viewed positively by the participants and the investigators. Several participants indicated the positive effects of telling their stories. In summary, the storytelling opportunity was viewed as positive by these participants. The stories provided insight into the experience not previously known. These seven stories narrated a life spent with metastatic cancer, seven lives soon to end.</p>
<p>Finally, there was one other strength and a few limitations of the study worth noting. The strength of the study is the diversity of the sample by gender, race, and diagnostic categories. Limitations are the sample size and the challenge of recruiting participants in the settings and at a time primed to tell their stories with enough physical strength to do so. Another limitation may be the inability to glean the differences between spirituality and religion in the narratives. The participants’ definitive responses to the presence of religion and the more ambiguous responses about spirituality raise the question of the uniqueness or overlap in these two socially constructed terms. It is difficult to determine if references to “God” or “Lord” when used extensively in the stories were or should be limited to organized religion. The artificial separation of definition of these terms may be of little value, and for this reason in this study we offer the combined response of religion/spirituality. Both terms are used to refer to the “spirit” in the mind, body, and spirit tripartite description of holism. There may be other understandings found in theology, secular humanism, existentialism, or metaphysics that might clearly distinguish these terms. Such effort is beyond the scope of this work and in a practical sense does not alter the lived experience of these participants or the focus of end-of-life patient care.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Previous studies of spiritual interventions indicate that spirituality is positively related to quality of life, social support, and effective coping strategies and negatively related to perceived stress, uncertainty, psychological distress, and emotional-focused coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898010111418116">Tuck, McCain, &amp; Elswick, 2001</xref>). Outcomes associated with spiritual care are feelings of reduced anxiety, peace, comfort, inner strength, acceptance, hopefulness, calmness, safety, general well-being, a stronger faith, and a positive change in attitude and outlook on life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010111418116">Conco, 1995</xref>). This study’s inclusion of spirituality as part of the cancer experience is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010111418116">Fryback &amp; Reinert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010111418116">Georgesen &amp; Dungan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010111418116">Highfield, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010111418116">Prince-Paul &amp; Exline, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898010111418116">Wittenberg-Lyles, Greene, &amp; Sanchez-Reilly, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In keeping with the findings of this exploratory study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010111418116">Fins, Guest, and Acres (2000)</xref> support narrative analysis as a qualitative method that offers the potential for understanding the experience of cancer at the end of life. The storytelling process facilitated by the PATS intervention was acceptable and feasible as a way of offering spiritual integration and healing. Potential positive effects warrant further investigation and translation to clinical practice. Future studies with larger samples will provide additional data about the usefulness of the PATS intervention. The principal investigator encourages others to use the intervention with permission in order to test the strength of the design.</p>
<p>In conclusion, stories can convey the most important experiences of a person’s life. There are stories that have never been told about major events of life and death. Patients with cancer and health care providers find storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010111418116">Chelf et al., 2000</xref>) and narratives as helpful ways to cope with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898010111418116">Wittenberg-Lyles et al., 2007</xref>). Putting events in one’s life into story-like form helps people to make sense of those events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010111418116">Pennebaker &amp; Seagal, 1999</xref>). Writing or talking about experiences is also associated with beneficial influences on immune functions, and research reveals that when people put their emotional upheavals into words both their physical and mental health improve markedly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010111418116">Pennebaker &amp; Seagal, 1999</xref>). This study examined the integration of presence, active listening, and contact or noncontact touch as a constructed approach for the storytelling intervention. The results indicate the potential for a modest positive effect on the well-being of participants albeit the scope of this study is too small for definitive results and to draw strong inferences.</p>
