<p><italic>The Paradox of Youth Violence</italic> offers a nuanced analysis of media discourse on violence by youthful offenders during the 1990s. J. William Spencer effectively demonstrates that media discourse was both shaped by and helped to shape cultural understandings of youth violence. Specifically, we learn how cultural understandings of youth and place coalesced with media discourse to frame the problem of youth violence, characterize its victims and offenders, and articulate causal explanations and solutions to the problem. This is done through an analysis of a database of more than 1,500 sources from the national news in both print and broadcast forms, as well as an in-depth analysis of seven iconic narratives.</p>
<p>The main theme of the book is that social discourse surrounding youth violence in the 1990s was fraught with uncertainty, which is evidenced by the multiple frames used to organize discussion of the problem, ambiguities in characterizations of youthful perpetrators, multi-faceted causal accounts, debates over solutions to the problem, and the mixed emotions of anger/anxiety and sympathy/compassion toward youthful perpetrators that the discourse both represented and evoked. The primary evidence of ambiguity is in the media’s apparent uncertainty about how to define the problem being discussed, framing it at various junctures as a problem of youth violence and at others as one of superpredators, gang violence, or school violence. These frames were sometimes invoked simultaneously and at other times on their own. As such, youth violence was not presented as a singular problem but as a vast assortment of problems framed in multiple ways.</p>
<p>The multiple frames used in discussions of youth violence helped create complexity and uncertainty in the dialogue about perpetrators, causes, and solutions. The complexity in discourse about these categories was further exacerbated by cultural meanings ascribed to youth and place that did not coalesce with violence committed by young people or with the spread of youth violence to the suburbs and small towns. Specifically, cultural definitions of youth as innocent and in need of protection could not be reconciled easily with the malevolence of the violent acts committed by young offenders. Thus, youthful offenders were portrayed in a complex manner as victimizers and victims, summoning mixed emotions of anger over their violent behavior but sympathy for what led them to it.</p>
<p>The discourse on what led youth to violence emphasized that myriad causes contributed to their violence. Importantly, discussions of causes were shaped by cultural assumptions about place. Violence that occurred in the big city was attributed to local neighborhood conditions, weak neighborhood institutions, and the moral poverty of the city. These explanations were not contested and required little elaboration. However, explanations for violence in the suburbs and small towns were complex and contested, partially because violence in these areas was unexpected and did not coalesce with cultural assumptions about place. Thus, the quest for causes of violence in the suburbs and small towns delved into the lives of offenders, focusing on psychological factors, and looked to causes, easy access to guns, media violence, teen culture, which were far removed from the immediate suburban or small town milieu.</p>
<p>Although searching for the causes of social problems is often considered essential to locating solutions, Spencer observes that the discourse on youth violence often was marred by a disconnect between causes and solutions. The times at which there was a direct connection were those when discussions of solutions were tied to the culture wars and became particularly contested. Interestingly, we see once again that culture contributed to complexity in discourse on youth violence. However, this time it is not shared cultural understandings but a culture war that set the stage for obfuscation. By the end of the decade, the discussion of solutions was characterized by polarizations between gun control versus media control and Democrat versus Republican. These polarizations drew on and contributed to ambiguity in discourse on youth violence, with one side focusing on the innocence of youth and the other emphasizing the evil of their behavior. Perhaps more significant, however, is that the drama associated with this polarization drew attention away from the collective search for solutions to youth violence, serving only to add to the complexity and obfuscation in the discourse.</p>
<p>Spencer clearly demonstrates that discourse about youth violence was fraught with ambiguity and complexity that shaped and was shaped by culture—shared understandings of youth and place, as well as the culture wars. However, the demonstration of complexity (particularly that evidenced by the media’s uncertainty in how to frame the problem) would have been strengthened by a more comprehensive discussion of the methods used to reach various conclusions about, for instance, the frames that dominated during various portions of the decade. There is no account of how articles/transcripts were coded as falling into various frames or the proportion of the articles/transcripts that fit into these frames overall or in various time periods.</p>
<p>The book also fell short in providing evidence for its underdeveloped claim that cultural assumptions about how race, class, and place coalesce were represented in discourses on youth violence. The general argument is that mention of place served as a proxy for race and class due to the cultural assumption that cities are populated by lower-class minorities, and suburbs/small towns by middle-class non-minorities. However, the only evidence provided to support this claim was that, for instance, the race of offending youth typically was not mentioned but presumably assumed by the producers and consumers of discourse on big city and small town/suburban youth violence. The argument could have been bolstered if the study offered examples of sources that made race explicit in instances of violence committed by non-minority youth in urban neighborhoods or violence by minority youth in suburban communities. Despite these relatively minor flaws, the book has much to offer and will certainly be useful for those teaching courses on social problems, public policy, criminal justice, and juvenile delinquency.</p>
