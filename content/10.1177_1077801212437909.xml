<p>The articles in this issue of <italic>Violence Against Women</italic> focus on women who have experienced intimate partner violence. Sonia Frias and Ronald Angel open the issue with an article based on their comparative study of IPV risk among poor urban Mexican-origin women. Using data from two surveys, they compare rates of reported violence among Mexican women living in Mexico with those of native-born and foreign-born Mexican women living in the United States. They found that Mexican women living in Mexico report significantly lower rates of IPV than both groups of Mexican-origin women living in the United States. Although they acknowledge that these findings may represent a real or true difference in the women’s experiences, they also caution that there are various factors, including cultural ones, that may better explain the observed differences. Their work is an important reminder of the difficulties that often arise when researchers try to compare groups that may at first appear quite similar but are, in fact, different in critically important ways that must be taken into account.</p>
<p>Emily Bauman, David Haaga, Stacey Kaltman, and Mary Ann Dutton examine the construct of social support. As they note, most researchers agree that social support is influential in the mental health outcomes of women who have experienced IPV. Nevertheless, researchers disagree on how to best measure social support. Bauman and her colleagues consider whether social support is best measured unidimensionally or multidimensionally. Their factor analysis of the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL) indicates that at least among low-income, African American IPV victims like the women in their sample, social support is best conceptualized unidimensionally.</p>
<p>Melissa Dichter and Richard Gelles explore how women who have called the police because of IPV perceive their subsequent risk of being revictimized and their sense of safety. Their findings indicate that women who experience especially severe forms of abuse, such as sexual violence and threats on their life, are most likely to feel unsafe and to think they are at risk of revictimization, despite police intervention. In this study, women who received support from others and who were able to put some geographic distance between themselves and their abusers felt safer.</p>
<p>Alesha Durfee further considers the impact of police responses to IPV by examining how mandatory arrest laws affect arrests of men and women in what she calls “situationally ambiguous” cases—that is, cases involving male and female partners whom the police consider both victims and offenders. Using data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), Durfee compares outcomes for male and female partners in these types of cases in jurisdictions with mandatory arrest laws, those with proarrest laws, and those that continue to give officers discretion in arrest decisions. Durfee’s analysis shows that after controlling for both incident and individual factors, women are disproportionately affected by mandatory arrest laws, echoing Dichter and Gelles’ findings showing that police intervention does not necessarily make women safer. However, Durfee also identifies factors that affect male-only arrests relative to female-only arrests, raising additional questions about the impact of legal interventions on IPV offenders and victims.</p>
<p>The final three articles in this issue look at various aspects of advocacy interventions for IPV victims. Shanti Kulkarni, Holly Bell, and Diane McDaniel Rhodes conducted focus group interviews with IPV survivors as well as national hotline advocates to examine the relationships between IPV service providers and the women who seek their help. The interviews revealed that survivors believe that IPV services are most helpful when advocates express empathy, contribute to women’s empowerment, address women’s individual needs, and respect ethical boundaries. Hotline advocates felt that services could be improved with better organizational resources, improved training, greater coordination among various community service providers, and efforts to reduce burnout among those undertaking this difficult work. As Kulkarni and her colleagues conclude, the recommendations of both groups—survivors and advocates—are fairly basic: empathetic, empowering, and mutually respectful interactions are key to providing high-quality services to IPV victims.</p>
<p>Sara Perez, Dawn Johnson, and Caroline Vaile Wright also emphasize the importance of fostering empowerment through IPV services. Perez and her colleagues found that interventions that enhance feelings of empowerment for IPV victims reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder resulting from abuse experiences. In fact, Perez et al.’s findings show that empowerment was even more important than resource acquisition in reducing PTSD symptoms among the shelter residents who participated in their study.</p>
<p>Finally, Ann Coker and her colleagues studied the extent to which a clinic-based advocacy program increased help-seeking, reduced subsequent violence, and improved the well-being of women who screened positive for IPV victimization. Women visiting health care clinics who were identified as IPV victims were either directed to an onsite advocate or were referred to offsite services by being given a service provider business card. Researchers subsequently followed-up with the women periodically over a period of 24 months. The findings indicate that women who received the onsite advocacy intervention reported less IPV and fewer depressive symptoms at follow-up compared with the women who received offsite referrals. Women who received the onsite advocacy intervention were also more likely to seek help from the police, a lawyer or the courts to obtain a protective order. As Coker and her colleagues conclude, IPV screening at health care clinics coupled with onsite advocacy appear to be promising interventions for improving a variety of outcomes for battered women.</p>
