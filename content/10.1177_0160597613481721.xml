<p>Last week, my daughter drove over a bent signpost in the road, and it flipped up and smashed a hole in her car directly under her seat. It ripped the car up, but fortunately she was uninjured. Then I found out that teenagers in her rural area sometimes leave booby traps like that on purpose, just for laughs. Imagine my outrage!</p>
<p>What puzzles me is that they do not even stick around to see the results. (If they did, they would probably quit doing it.) What kind of society do we live in that fosters such anonymous malice? I can understand walking around with a chip on your shoulder and getting into a fight with someone who pisses you off. Even if that person is merely a trigger and not the real cause of your anger, at least there is some personal connection, another human being at the end of your fist. But to set an anonymous ambush? The perpetrator has no connection with the victim, and in fact deliberately avoids connection. What is that about?</p>
<p>Systems theory offers a heuristic clue: The problem contains the solution. Perhaps the very anonymity is not only the symptom but the cause. Humans need contact with other humans. We are, as ethologists say, obligatorily gregarious. We need close, warm contact with others as much as we need food and water. If we do not get essential nutrients, we suffer; and if we do not get them long enough we become deformed. Likewise, if we do not get close, warm contact, we become socially deformed; and that deformity plays out as malevolence that, in its very anonymity, contains a hidden cry for help.</p>
<p>Research tells us how social and political structures exacerbate or mitigate the isolation that causes such harm. But it does not tell us how to open our hearts and hear the inchoate cries of those who feel compelled to lash out to assuage their own pain. Could I enter imaginatively into the lived experience of the perpetrator, and reach out to that person with compassion? Could I put aside my outrage—or at least deal with it in other ways—and see that person not as my enemy but as a fellow member of the human family? If I could, it might begin to heal me and to heal hurtful social structures as well.</p>
