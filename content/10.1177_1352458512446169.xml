<title>Background:</title>
<p>Sex ratio in multiple sclerosis has been reported from several geographical areas. The disease is more common in women. In Europe the female-to-male ratio varies from 1.1 to 3.4. A recent study from Canada has reported a significant increase, with time, in female-to-male ratio in multiple sclerosis over the last 100 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458512446169">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to analyse any change in sex ratio in multiple sclerosis in the Swedish population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1352458512446169">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Data from the Swedish MS Register and data from the Swedish National Statistics Office were used to estimate sex ratio by year of birth and year of onset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458512446169">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>In the analysis of sex ratio by year of birth there were 8834 patients (6271 women and 2563 men) born between 1931 and 1985. The mean women-to-men ratio was 2.62. No clear trend was noted for the women-to-men ratio by year of birth (Spearman’s rho = 0.345, <italic>p</italic> = 0.298, <italic>n</italic> = 11). The number of patients analysed by year of onset was 9098 during the time period 1946 until 2005. The mean women-to-men ratio was 2.57. No significant change in women-to-men ratio (Spearman’s rho = −0.007, <italic>p</italic> = 0.983, <italic>n</italic> = 12) with time was observed.</p>

<title>Introduction/background</title>
<p>Several studies over the last decade have indicated an increased women-to-men ratio in multiple sclerosis (MS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512446169">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512446169">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512446169">3</xref></sup> This is due to an increased incidence in women rather than a decline in men. According to Pugliatti's review article the women-to-men ratio for MS in Europe varies from 1.1 to 3.4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512446169">4</xref></sup> A recent Canadian study showed a significant increase in women-to-men ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512446169">5</xref></sup> over the last 100 years. However, no changes of women-to-men ratio between 1990 and 2004 were seen in Alberta, Canada,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512446169">6</xref></sup> where the incidence of MS is very high. Results from a follow-up of the incidence of MS (1953–2002) in Hordaland, Norway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512446169">7</xref></sup> showed an increase in the women-to-men ratio from 1.27 (1953–1957) to 2.4 (1978–1982), and afterwards there was a tendency towards a decrease in the women-to-men ratio (our calculation of their data). Data from different prevalence studies in Sweden has shown the following women-to-men ratios: 1.9 in the county of Västerbotten (1997); 2.3 in the county of Värmland (2002); 2.35 for the whole of Sweden (2008).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512446169">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512446169">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512446169">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>A previous epidemiological study in Sweden (1952–1992) by our group showed an increased mortality in women than in men, during the period 1982 to 1992.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512446169">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>MS is a putative autoimmune disease and other diseases of that type, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), have a female predominance. The reason for this phenomenon is unknown, but one hypothesis is that the gender difference in susceptibility arises from interactions between endocrine factors and the immune system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512446169">12</xref></sup> One such example is microchimerism, where stem cells that are more frequent in parous women have the physiological role of preventing the maternal immune response from rejecting the foetus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512446169">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effect of cigarette smoking on MS has been discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512446169">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512446169">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512446169">16</xref></sup> A recent study, from 2011, which involved data from Canada and Denmark, confirmed that cigarette smoking increases the risk for MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512446169">17</xref></sup> This study also showed that changes in smoking patterns in women and men significantly correlated with an increase in the women-to-men ratio in MS. However, the authors suggest that there must be also some other factor that accounts for the increase in MS among women.</p>
<p>In the past it has been difficult to evaluate the results of epidemiological studies because of variations over time in ethnicity, diagnostic procedures, accessibility to medical equipment and, above all, case definition and privileged access to a healthcare system for men. Furthermore, studies have often represented different periods in time.</p>
<p>Accurate registrations of cases over time in a defined population from a limited area is of great value. They allow us to evaluate and analyse, for example, prevalence and incidence rates as well as sex ratio.</p>
<p>The study in Canada,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512446169">5</xref></sup> which presented results showing a significant increase in MS amongst women, was based on patient cohorts by year of birth. The women-to-men ratio in MS ranged from 1.3 to 3.96 for persons born during the period from 1891 to 1993. The aim of our study was to analyse any change in sex ratio in MS in the Swedish population by year of birth and year of onset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1352458512446169" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>For both analyses of sex ratio in MS determined by year of birth and by year of onset, data from the National Swedish MS Register (SMSreg)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512446169">18</xref></sup> and data from the Total Population Register of the Swedish National Statistics Office were used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512446169">19</xref></sup> Possible MS and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) were not included.</p>
<p>The use of unique personal identity numbers ensured that MS patients registered in SMSreg are counted only once.</p>
<sec id="section8-1352458512446169">
<title>Sex ratio by year of birth</title>
<p>In the study populations by year of birth, all persons diagnosed with MS born in Sweden during the period from 1921 to 1989 were included. After this period, it was not possible to identify the place of birth using the personal number, including whether or not the person was born abroad. The study group was a ‘closed population’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512446169">20</xref></sup> defined for the purpose of this study as persons born in Sweden and not of immigrant background. Data on the number of women and men born each year from 1921 to 1989 was obtained from the Total Swedish Population Register.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512446169">19</xref></sup> Information on the number of women and men with MS by year of birth, born in Sweden was taken from SMSreg. The study period was divided into 11 five-year cohorts from 1931–1935 to 1981–1985. Prevalence proportions were calculated as the number of cases of MS from each year-of-birth cohort (numerator) divided by the size of the birth cohort (denominator) for each five-year interval for both sexes. The sex ratios were then calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1352458512446169">
<title>Sex ratio by year of onset</title>
<p>All persons with a diagnosis of MS registered in the SMSreg, including Swedish born and immigrants, with information about sex and year of onset, were included in this study group. The population size for each year 1941 to 2005 was taken from the Total Swedish Population Register.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512446169">19</xref></sup> The study period was divided into 12 five-year cohorts, from 1946–1950 to 2001–2005. For each five-year period the age and sex-adjusted incidence rates were calculated. Thereafter the sex ratios were calculated covering onset periods from 1946 to 2005.</p>

<sec id="section10-1352458512446169">
<title>The National Swedish MS Register</title>
<p>The web-based version of the SMSreg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512446169">18</xref></sup> started in 2001. It covers the whole of Sweden. Patients with MS or possible MS/CIS have been prospectively and retrospectively registered by the neurologists that are responsible for the patient’s care, who continuously update patient information, including pharmacological interventions and outcome in terms of the number of bouts and disability development, using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and other instruments. In the register, the year of onset is defined as the first symptoms of MS verified by the doctor. These symptoms can be taken from the history, from previous medical files or from the actual clinical visit. Clinical symptoms are categorized in order to form prognostic markers, developed by the founders of the registers. The patients are categorized according to their onset symptoms, whether these concern the sensory or motor nervous system, whether the patients have optic neuritis and whether the symptoms go into complete remission or not. These are the prognostic markers of importance for the development of disease. The following bouts are also categorized in the same way. The accuracy of the register is checked and reported in a yearly report which includes regional variations of epidemiologic features. The register is sorted into the Swedish Quality Registers surveilled by The National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen). There are a total of 71 regional clinics gathering information. In November 2011, the SMSreg comprised about 70% of the estimated number of prevalent cases in Sweden, that is, about 13,000 MS patients. The reliability and validity of the register turns out to be good, though the registrations of patients are not yet homogenous; the northern (Norrbotten), north-eastern (Västernorrland) and south-eastern (Blekinge, Kalmar) counties, for example, covered less than 50% of the expected prevalence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512446169">18</xref></sup> The register is, however, rapidly growing.</p>
<p>The diagnostic criteria for MS have changed with time. Prior to 1983 the diagnosis of MS was based on the criteria of Schumacher.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512446169">21</xref></sup> In 1983 the Schumacher criteria were replaced by the Poser criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512446169">22</xref></sup> An International Panel on the Diagnosis of MS presented new diagnostic criteria for MS in 2001, which are now known as the McDonald criteria. These criteria have been extensively assessed and used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458512446169">23</xref></sup> In 2005 these criteria were revised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512446169">24</xref></sup> Common to all these diagnostic criteria is that MS patients must demonstrate dissemination of lesions in both space and time, and any alternative diagnosis must be excluded. The SMSreg has followed the diagnostic criteria, as mentioned above, and changes made according to new revision recommendations.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 10,807 MS-patients registered in the SMSreg in November 2010, born from 1912 onwards and there were 8834 patients (6271 women and 2563 men) who were born in Sweden during the period 1931 to 1985.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There was no evidence for an increasing women-to-men ratio in MS in Sweden, neither in the prevalence proportion by year of birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512446169">Figure 1</xref>) nor of the incidence rates by year of onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512446169">Figure 2</xref>). Consequently, there was no such trend as described in a previous Canadian study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512446169">5</xref></sup> A similar trend to the one in our study was seen in Hordaland, Norway,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512446169">7</xref></sup> where our calculation of their data even showed a tendency towards a decreasing women-to-men ratio from the end of the 1970s until 2002. These ratios were based on patient’s year of onset. The latest ratio, however, with onset in 1998–2002, can be expected to change in the future as the population ages and more individuals are diagnosed. In the most recent nationwide prevalence study in MS (2008) in Sweden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512446169">10</xref></sup> the women-to-men ratio was 2.35 at the prevalence day on 31 December 2008. This confirms our findings that there has been no increase of the women-to-men ratio in Sweden. Our result, however, demonstrated an increasing incidence of MS by year of onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512446169">Figure 2</xref>), which is in agreement with other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512446169">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512446169">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512446169">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458512446169">29</xref></sup> The increasing incidence rate by year of onset during the last decade has probably been influenced by changes in diagnostic procedure such as the criteria for MS and accessibility to medical equipment, mainly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>
<p>Increased morbidity from MS was seen in the prevalence proportion by birth cohort, but after 1960 it decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512446169">Figure 1</xref>). An increasing women-to-men ratio in MS prevalence by year of birth in patients born 1976 to 1985 can be explained by the fact that women have an earlier onset of MS than men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512446169">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512446169">13</xref></sup> The increase in morbidity in MS by year of birth in the first period may be due to diagnostic procedures, as explained above. Furthermore, the number of MS patients born during 1976 to 1985 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512446169">Figure 1</xref>) is lower, but this could be explained by the fact that not all MS cases have been diagnosed so far because of lack of symptoms and signs fulfilling diagnostic criteria.</p>
<p>The increased morbidity of MS gave us the reason to analyse age of onset. The number of persons with MS born in Sweden was analysed by year of birth and sex. Age at onset for MS patients showed a falling trend from year of birth 1931 to 1985 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512446169">Figure 3</xref>). The mean age of onset was decreasing in women from 39.0 years in the first period, 1931–1935, to 20.9 in the last period, 1981–1985. The corresponding values for men were 41.2 and 21.3. These changes towards a lower age at onset were significant (Spearman’s rho, in women: <italic>r</italic> = −0.998, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>n</italic> = 11; in men: <italic>r</italic> = − 0.991, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>n</italic> = 11). This, of course, may partly be an effect of better diagnostic methods by the routine use of MRI in recent times. Also individuals with higher age at onset have not yet shown signs of the disease.</p>

<p>Authors of the prevalence study in Denmark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512446169">3</xref></sup> have suggested that the present high age of first childbirth and use of contraception may be other factors that explain the increasing incidence in women. A Swedish study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458512446169">30</xref></sup> has shown a significant difference in mean age at onset when women who have used combined oral contraceptives (COCs) were compared with women not using COCs. Women who had used COCs had a higher age at onset, implying that a low age at first childbirth and use of COC would be protective factors against MS. In our study, however, we found very similar curves of age at onset in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512446169">Figure 3</xref>) and that the women-to-men ratio had marginally changed over the last 30 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512446169">Figure 2</xref>). Comparing the results of the Danish study, we can not confirm these; we have not found such differences in age at onset between women and men, and in the sex ratio.</p>
<p>The use of data from the SMSreg has both strengths and limitations. The major strength is that data are collected nationally and the same principles are followed everywhere. The accuracy of the register is regarded as good, even though there is not full coverage of all counties. The time of onset in a patient is decided and registered by the responsible neurologist, who also registers the correct diagnosis: CIS or MS. The diagnostic criteria may vary in the register because older patents may have been diagnosed by following the Poser criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512446169">22</xref></sup> but recent registrations follow McDonald revised criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458512446169">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512446169">24</xref></sup> Furthermore the calculation of the sex ratio in MS in Sweden was based on prevalence proportion in the birth cohorts and based on age and sex-adjustment incidence rates by year of onset. This procedure increased the reliability of sex ratio results for the whole Swedish population.</p>
<p>The very recent nationwide prevalence study on MS in Sweden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512446169">10</xref></sup> mentioned above, revealed higher numbers of MS cases compared with previous estimations. This also applies to the numbers registered in SMSreg. In this prevalence study, patients from The Swedish National Patient Register (NPR) were also included. Considering this, the SMSreg actually comprises about 70% of the recently estimated number of prevalent cases in Sweden. This is due to the fact that not all county departments have given a complete report of their cases to the SMSreg. Furthermore, the SMSreg is a prospective register, which means that not all patients with late stage/late secondary progressive disease are registered, particularly if they are treated by a general practitioner. Such factors can affect the sex ratio.</p>
<p>The study in Canada<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512446169">5</xref></sup> that showed significantly increasing women-to-men ratios with time has been followed up. The authors demonstrated that this increase comprised women patients with relapsing–remitting type of MS only and not primary progressive MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458512446169">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>In another Canadian study, immigrants with MS onset after immigration to Canada were examined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458512446169">32</xref></sup> The women-to-men ratio gradually and progressively increased in a rather similar way to that of the Canadian-born MS patients. The women-to-men ratio and the rate of change varied according to immigrants’ region of origin. Immigrants from the UK and Ireland were the largest group, accounting for 65% of all immigrants. The increasing women-to-men ratio was significant in this group, which is supported by previously reported increases in women-to-men ratio in the UK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512446169">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a control of validity, data from our study of prevalence in the county of Värmland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512446169">9</xref></sup> was used. In that investigation, a strategy of a careful search for MS patients was introduced, and the assessment involved all persons with MS in the county of Värmland on the prevalence day. In this study, it is most likely that those patients registered in the NPR were involved. The number of persons with MS by year of birth, sex and whether or not they were born in Värmland was analysed. No clear trend was found for the women-to-men ratio, analysed by patients’ year of birth during the period 1931 to 1975 (<italic>r</italic> = 0.383, <italic>p</italic> = 0.308, <italic>n</italic> = 9). Compared with the sex ratio for the whole country, there was a more varied women-to-men ratio with time in Värmland. The sex ratio in MS by patients’ year of onset during the period 1968 to 2002 was also analysed. Neither did this show any increasing trend in women-to-men ratio (<italic>r</italic> = 0.000, <italic>p</italic> = 1.000, <italic>n</italic> = 8). The sex ratio in the group of patients with relapsing–remitting MS in Värmland was analysed by year of birth, and did not show any increase of the women-to-men ratio (Spearman's rho = 0.496, <italic>p</italic> = 0.175, <italic>n</italic> = 9), as was seen in Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458512446169">31</xref></sup></p>
