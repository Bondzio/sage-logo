<italic>Objectives:</italic> The concept of recovery has begun shifting mental health service delivery from a medical perspective toward a client-centered recovery orientation. This shift is also beginning in Hong Kong, but its development is hampered by a dearth of available measures in Chinese. <italic>Method:</italic> This article translates two measures of recovery (mental health recovery measure and the recovery subscale of peer outcomes protocol) and one measure of recovery-promoting environments (recovery self-assessment) into Chinese and investigates their psychometric properties among 206 Hong Kong Chinese people with severe mental illness. <italic>Result:</italic> Multifactor solutions from earlier studies were not replicated; our evidence pointed to one-factor solutions. Since all recovery measures demonstrated high internal consistency reliability (.92 to .96), we analyzed total scale scores. <italic>Conclusion:</italic> Moderately high correlations among the recovery measures (.33 to .56) provide some support for construct validity, yet further investigation of recovery measures in a Chinese population is needed.</p>

<p>An accumulation of historical evidence over the past century has begun to moderate the previously bleak prognosis for individuals with severe mental illnesses, particularly for those with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731512471861">Frese, Knight, &amp; Saks, 2009</xref>). Long-term studies of schizophrenia patients have consistently found higher than expected rates of functional (50–59%) and full recovery (22–26%) in follow-up periods of 20 or more years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512471861">Bleuler, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731512471861">Ciompi, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731512471861">Huber, Gross, Schuttler, &amp; Linz, 1980</xref>) suggesting the negative prognosis routinely associated with schizophrenia is frequently incorrect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731512471861">Hopper, Harrison, Janca, &amp; Sartorius, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Early in this century in the United States, the President’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512471861">New Freedom Commission on Mental Health Report (2002)</xref> critiqued a fragmented mental health system based on a disease model that “simply manages symptoms and accepts long-term disability” (p. 1). The Commission posed a challenge to fundamentally transform mental health care in the United States to “ensure that mental health services and supports actively facilitate recovery, and build resilience to face life’s challenges” (p. 1). This shift in the orientation of mental health services from managing long-term disability and toward promoting recovery has resonated in many parts of the Western world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049731512471861">Slade, Amering, &amp; Oades, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049731512471861">Turner-Crowson &amp; Wallcraft, 2002</xref>) and has begun taking root in parts of Asia, including Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049731512471861">Tse, Siu, &amp; Kan, 2011</xref>), Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512471861">Chiba, Kawakami, &amp; Miyamoto, 2011</xref>), and Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731512471861">Song &amp; Hsu, 2011</xref>). This is a fundamental shift in the paradigm of mental health service delivery from long-term symptom and disability management to a client-centered recovery orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731512471861">Ramon, Healy, &amp; Renouf, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Promoting recovery has been adopted as either national policy or as the guiding principle of mental health service reform in numerous countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731512471861">Siu, Yeung, Poon, &amp; Sun, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049731512471861">Slade et al., 2008</xref>). Yet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049731512471861">Slade, Amering, and Oades (2008</xref>) describe this growing consensus in policy circles as mere “rhetorical consensus” (p. 128), since there are numerous definitions of recovery and “rationale debate is not possible without conceptual clarity” (p. 128). A fundamental distinction, they argue, is between clinical recovery (also termed <italic>recovery as an outcome</italic>) which focuses on “sustained remission and restoration of functioning” (p. 128) and personal recovery (or “recovery as a process”) which “focuses on living a satisfying, hopeful and contributing life even with the limitations caused by the illness” (p. 128). These two approaches to defining recovery are different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512471861">Andresen, Caputi, &amp; Oades, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The medical model defines mental illness recovery as absence or remission of a disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049731512471861">Rudnick, 2008</xref>). Yet, from the consumer perspective, recovery does not necessarily mean “cure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512471861">Juvva &amp; Newhill, 2011</xref>) in the sense of returning to a preillness state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731512471861">Ramon et al., 2007</xref>). Recovery is also more than symptom management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512471861">Bradstreet &amp; Connor, 2005</xref>) and may occur without complete symptom relief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512471861">Anthony, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the medical model, the developing recovery paradigm adopts a more holistic perspective, incorporating traditional dimensions of symptom reduction, improved functioning, and positive mental health, along with an emphasis on a person’s multiple needs, their empowerment, their involvement in shared decision making, and reintegration into community life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512471861">Anthony, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731512471861">Marshall, Crowe, Oades, Deane, &amp; Kavanagh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512471861">Ramsay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512471861">Roe, Joseph, &amp; Midleton, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512471861">Liberman and Kopelowictz (2005)</xref> described these two approaches to defining recovery as “the process of recovering and recovery as an outcome” that are “in apposition, not opposition” (p. 741).</p>

<title>Process Definitions of Mental Health Recovery</title>
<p>Many people with severe mental illness can live a satisfying and meaningful life. This has been referred to as <italic>recovery</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731512471861">Rodgers, Norell, Roll, &amp; Dyck, 2007</xref>), or “personal recovery” (Slade at al., 2008). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731512471861">Bellack (2006</xref>) describes consumer definitions of recovery as having emerged “from something akin to a civil rights movement among consumers and a sociopolitical change in public attitudes towards mental illness” (p. 435).</p>
<p>Anthony’s (1993) widely cited process definition defines recovery as “a deeply personal, unique process of changing one’s attitudes, values, feelings and goals, skills, and/or roles … [that] involves the development of new meaning and purpose in one’s life” (p. 15). Similarly, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731512471861">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA, 2004)</xref> National Consensus Statement on Mental Health Recovery identified recovery as a journey of healing and transformation which enables a person with mental illness to live a meaningful life in the community and strive to achieve his/ her full potential. This definition was recently updated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049731512471861">SAMHSA (2012)</xref> as “a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential.”</p>
<p>In this sense, recovery includes social recovery and involves building a life beyond illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731512471861">South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and South West London and St George’s Mental Health NHS Trust, 2010</xref>). It involves a process of learning how to live with mental illness while striving toward positive goals, including developing a sense of control, self-respect, and an appreciation of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049731512471861">Smith, 2000</xref>). The recovery process reflects changes in experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512471861">Resnick, Rosenheck, &amp; Lehman, 2004</xref>), such as empowerment, hope, potentiality, self-determination, self-efficacy/self-esteem, optimism/control over the future, finding meaning in life, taking responsibility for recovery, reestablishment of identity, and general feeling of well-being/life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512471861">Andresen, Oades, &amp; Caputi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731512471861">Onken, Craig, Ridgway, Ralph,, &amp; Cook, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512471861">Resnick, Fontana, Lehman, &amp; Rosenheck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049731512471861">Rogers, Chamberlin, Ellison, &amp; Crean, 1997</xref>). However, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512471861">Anthony (1993</xref>), the concept of recovery ties these various domains into a single idea. Regardless of the dimensionality of recovery, essential components include hope, meaning, and purpose in life, continual growth, increased control over one’s life, and reestablishment of a sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731512471861">Loveland, Randall, &amp; Corrigan, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>SAMHSA has promoted the early development of measures of recovery and of recovery-promoting environments through a number of grants for the development of recovery measures in collaboration with mental health consumers. <italic>Measuring the Promise: A Compendium of Recovery Measures </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731512471861">Campbell-Orde, Chamberin, Carpenter, &amp; Leff, 2005</xref>), contains nine recovery measures and four measures of recovery-promoting environments. It was developed, in part, with SAMHSA support. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731512471861">Song and Hsu (2011</xref>) review and critique the reliability and validity of these measures as a stepping off point in the development of their own recovery measure in Taiwan.</p>

<title>Nascence of Recovery in Hong Kong</title>
<p>The development and implementation of the recovery concept in mental health services is still in its infancy in most Asian countries, including Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049731512471861">Tse et al., 2011</xref>). Surveys of mental health professionals in Hong Kong have indicated high agreement with the concept of recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731512471861">Siu et al., 2011</xref>), albeit with pessimistic attitudes toward the prospect of recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731512471861">Ng, Pearson, Chen, &amp; Law, 2011</xref>), as well as a need for more training of professionals in the key aspects of recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512471861">Mak, Lam, &amp; Yau, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731512471861">Chiu, Ho, Lo, and Yiu (2010</xref>) survey of mental health outpatients found that SAMHSA’s 10 components of recovery (self-direction, individualized and person centered, empowerment, holistic, nonlinear, strength based, peer support, respect, responsibility, and hope) “appeared to contain valid concepts for Chinese subjects” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731512471861">Chiu, Ho, Lo, &amp; Yiu, 2010</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>Two measures of recovery have been preliminarily developed in Chinese communities. The Psychosis Recovery Inventory was developed in Hong Kong to measure issues specific to recovery from a first episode of psychosis, including patients’ attitudes toward illness, toward treatment, and their perceptions of personal recovery and risk for relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512471861">Chen, Tam, Wong, Law, &amp; Chiu, 2005</xref>). The Stages of Recovery scale (SRS) was developed in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731512471861">Song &amp; Hsu, 2011</xref>) tapping dimensions of recovery very similar to those used by SAMHSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731512471861">Chiu et al., 2010</xref>). This scale incorporates items derived from several previously developed scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731512471861">Campbell-Orde et al., 2005</xref>), including the two used in the present study (peer outcomes protocol [POP] and mental health recovery measure [MHRM]). The SRS endeavors to measure both process and outcome dimensions of recovery, and was published at about the time data were collected for the present study.</p>
<p>Qualitative explorations of the concept of recovery in Hong Kong suggest that recovery is multidimensional and includes not only symptom control and medication compliance but also more positive features of regaining previous functions, both cognitive (e.g., being able to concentrate, thinking clearly, and being responsive) and social (e.g., having positive relationships, being respected and respecting others, and independent living; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731512471861">Lam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731512471861">Ng et al., 2008</xref>). These qualitative explorations appear quite consistent with the Western views of recovery from a consumer perspective. Yet, some Chinese investigators wonder whether people with a Chinese cultural mind-set may interpret recovery differently from Western people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731512471861">Chiu et al., 2010</xref>). For example, the emphasis of autonomy and independence in Western society may not be the focus of recovery in the Chinese culture, since “Chinese people’s well-being is significantly determined by a harmonious relationship with others in the social and cultural context” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731512471861">Hsiao, Klimidis, Minas, &amp; Tan, 2006</xref>, p. 998).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049731512471861">Tse, Siu, and Kan (2011</xref>) advanced three strategies to help promote the development of recovery-oriented mental health services in Hong Kong, to develop “an understanding of the concepts of recovery in … Chinese communities … [to] grow leaders from within the service user communities. [and to] develop a scale to measure recovery” (p. 3). Reliable and valid measures are essential for evaluating mental health services and assessing the effects of recovery-promoting environments. In this study, we adopt Tse and colleagues’ third strategy, translating and investigating the reliability and validity of two measures of mental health recovery (MHRM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731512471861">Young &amp; Bullock, 2005</xref>; POP—recovery subscale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512471861">Campbell, Cook, Jonikas, &amp; Einspahr, 2005</xref>) and one measure of recovery-promoting environments (<italic>recovery self-assessment</italic>; RSA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512471861">O’Connell, Tondora, Croog, Evans, &amp; Davidson, 2005a</xref>) in a Hong Kong Chinese context.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A convenience sample (<italic>N</italic> = 206) of mental health service users at one of the Hong Kong’s largest nongovernmental organizations (NGOs; Baptist Oi Kwan Social Services) was taken during the summer and fall of 2011. This agency provides a spectrum of services which include halfway houses, small group homes, integrated community mental health services, day training centers, and caregiver support services in all areas of Hong Kong (Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories). Study selection criteria included (1) mental health service users of the agency for at least 6 months and (2) no relapse or history of attempted suicide in the past 3 months. Except for a few illiterate participants who were read the questions by staff, the large majority of questionnaires were self-administered. The research project was approved by the agency’s research ethics review board and written consent was received from each participant prior to administering the questionnaire. Completed questionnaires were returned to staff and then given to the research team. All service users who were approached completed the questionnaires. This is not unusual because many were regular service users and Chinese tend to be highly compliant to requests from people with whom they are familiar.</p>
<p>In addition to demographics, the questionnaire contained four standardized measures, the MHRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731512471861">Young &amp; Bullock, 2005</xref>), the RSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512471861">O’Connell et al., 2005a</xref>), the recovery subscale of the POP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512471861">Campbell et al., 2005</xref>), and the Chinese version of the <italic>World Health Organization’s Quality of Life Brief Version </italic>(WHOQOL-BREF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049731512471861">Yao, Chung, Yu, &amp; Wang, 2002</xref>). With the exception of the WHOQOL-BREF, the other three instruments were translated by the research team. Initial translation by a bilingual research assistant was checked for accuracy by the first and third authors. The research team met and discussed translations with the agency staff to ensure the clarity and applicability of the items to the clients. The questionnaires were then pilot tested with about 20 clients from the agency. Traditional Chinese (as used in Hong Kong and Taiwan) translations of these instruments are attached (Appendices A–C).</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731512471861">Young and Bullock (2005</xref>) developed the MHRM to provide a comprehensive evaluation of mental health recovery from a consumer perspective, without measuring psychiatric symptoms.

Each item records level of agreement on a 5-point scale, with “1” denoting <italic>totally disagree</italic> and “5” <italic>totally agree</italic>. Prior reliability tests have shown good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α of .93 for the total score and .60 to .86 for subscales) and high test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .92 1-week, and <italic>r</italic> = .91 2-week test–retest reliability; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731512471861">Young &amp; Bullock, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>Campbell and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512471861">Campbell et al., 2005</xref>) developed the POP in collaboration with consumer survivors and their family members “to measure domains that are important to people in recovery themselves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731512471861">Campbell-Orde et al., 2005</xref>, p. 50).

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512471861">O’Connell, Tondora, Croog, Evans, and Davidson (2005a</xref>) developed the RSA to measure “the degree to which recovery-promoting practices are evident” within a mental health service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731512471861">Young &amp; Bullock, 2005</xref>, p. 91). The RSA has an advantage of multiple versions for different stakeholder groups (person in recovery, service provider, and significant other/family member; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512471861">Campbell et al., 2005</xref>) that allows triangulation of information and comparison across stakeholder perspectives. Only the person in recovery version was used in this study. Agreement with each item is measured on a 5-point scale, with “1” denoting <italic>totally disagree</italic> and “5” <italic>totally agree</italic>. Initial assessment of internal consistency reliability of the five RSA subscales (life goals, involvement, diversity of treatment options, choice, and individually tailored services) ranged from .76 to .90, and these subscales jointly accounted for 54% of the scale variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512471861">O’Connell et al., 2005a</xref>). A five-factor structure was confirmed in a subsequent study, with internal consistency reliability for the factors ranging from .76 to .89, internal consistency of the total scale at .96, and a 2-week test–retest correlation of .84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049731512471861">Salyers, Tsai, &amp; Stultz, 2007</xref>).

<p>The distributional shape of the MHRM and QOL were quite normal. However, the POP and RSA were significantly negatively skewed and had high kurtosis, suggesting participants tended to provide high ratings on these two scales. We took the square of the original scores of the POP and RSA to normalize the distributions and conducted separate analyses (i.e., <italic>t</italic>-test, correlation, and analysis of variance [ANOVA]) using the transformed RSA and POP as well as the original data. Results showed no significant differences comparing results derived from the two sets of data (i.e., original and transformed). Therefore, for ease of current understanding and to facilitate future comparisons, we present results derived from analyses using the original data. <italic>T</italic>-tests found no significant differences by gender on any of the four constructs. Similarly, ANOVA failed to find any significant differences by employment status, and correlation analysis found no significant relationships between recovery measures and education. However, correlation analysis did find age was significantly associated with two of the four measures, having modest positive correlations with POP (<italic>r</italic> = .25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and the RSA (<italic>r</italic> = .21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). To test whether this association might be confounded by the experience of coping with illness, we constructed a “years since onset of illness” variable (i.e., current age minus age of first onset) and calculate its correlations with key measures. However, these correlations were all small (range = .06–.08) and nonsignificant, therefore we did not find confounding.</p>

<sec id="section12-1049731512471861">
<title>Internal Consistency Reliability</title>
<p>The internal consistency reliability coefficient (Cronbach’s α) for the QOL total score was .93. Internal consistency reliability coefficients for the MHRM (.96), POP (.92), and the RSA (.96) were also very high. Item level tests were conducted to assess the scale mean and variance if an item was deleted, corrected item-total correlations, and Cronbach’s α if item deleted. Results suggested that the items all performed quite well, with no significant improvements in reliability associated with deleting individual items, in measuring their respective recovery constructs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049731512471861">
<title>Factor Structure of the MHRM</title>
<p>Factor analyses were conducted to assess the dimensionality of each of the three recovery measures. Common factor analysis (i.e., principal axis factoring), instead of principal component analysis, was adopted because the main purpose of the factor analysis is to identify the underlying structure, rather than extracting fewer uncorrelated components that retain maximum variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512471861">Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, &amp; Strahan, 1999</xref>). With oblique promax rotation, the extracted factors are allowed to correlate, which is more consistent with the underlying theoretical relationship among the subscales of the measures.</p>
<p>When considering the number of factors to be extracted, we considered not only the commonly used criteria such as scree test and Kaiser’s rule of eigenvalue greater than 1 but also the more rigorous parallel analysis approach (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049731512471861">Zwick &amp; Velicer, 1986</xref>), including the interpretability of solutions. Balancing these various considerations can help avoid a purely data-driven approach to factor extraction. Parallel analysis is a technique that simulates the intended factor analysis using a hypothetical, computer-generated data set and compares resulting eigenvalues with those derived from the studied data. A factor will be extracted when its eigenvalue based on the studied data is larger than the corresponding one resulting from parallel analysis.</p>
<p>We conducted parallel analysis using the program designed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731512471861">O’Connor (2000</xref>), in which the 95th percentile eigenvalues and 1,000 simulated data sets were specified (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512471861">Crawford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512471861">Longman, Cota, Holden, &amp; Fekken, 1989</xref>). Results of factor analysis of the entire MHRM measure suggested that only the first factor (eigenvalue = 14.69; explaining 49.5% of the variance) should be extracted, although the eigenvalues of the three subsequent factors were slightly larger than 1 (i.e., 1.58, 1.20, and 1.13). Factor loadings for the one-factor solution were consistently high, ranging from .54 to .78 (median: .69). Therefore, to avoid the loss of variance that would accompany factor construction, for comparability with other studies, and due to the high internal consistency reliability of the scale (Cronbach’s α = .96), we used the total MHRM score in subsequent analyses.</p>

<sec id="section14-1049731512471861">
<title>Factor Structure of the RSA</title>
<p>We tested the factor structure of the RSA, attempting to replicate the five-factor structure previously reported (O’Connell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512471861">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049731512471861">Salyers et al., 2007</xref>). While this solution accounted for 62% of the variance, the factor loadings failed to clearly reproduce the original pattern. Parallel analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512471861">Crawford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512471861">Longman et al., 1989</xref>) suggested three factors might be extracted, with eigenvalues of 14.1, 2.4, and 1.5 (accounting for 44.1%, 7.5%, and 4.6% of the variance). However, once again the first factor explained the largest amount of variance, with all items loading in the .44 to .88 range (median: .71), and the factor loadings did not occur in the patterns found in previous research. Specifically, items from O’Connell and colleagues’ (2005a) Factors 2 and 3 tended to load on our Factor 1; their Factor 1 and 3 items loaded on our Factor 2. Moreover, in both the three- and five-factor solutions, most items loaded on the first two factors, which were highly correlated with each other (i.e., <italic>r </italic>= .62 and .58, respectively). Once again, for reasons of parsimony, ease of interpretation, to avoid the loss of variance, and due to the high internal consistency reliability of the whole scale (α = .96), we chose to use the total RSA score in subsequent analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049731512471861">
<title>Factor Structure of the POP</title>
<p>The recovery subscale of the POP was designed for self-assessment of general recovery progress. With the same parallel analysis factor procedure, we obtained a single factor (eigenvalue 6.77, explaining 52.1% of item variance) in the POP scale. Factor loadings were also high, ranging from .54 to .78 (median of .71). This is consistent with the theoretical expectation of the POP recovery subscale as a holistic evaluation of recovery, as no specific domains were differentiated. Therefore, we again used the total scale score (α = .92) in subsequent analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049731512471861">
<title>Incremental Validity of the Subscales</title>
<p>Since factor analysis in the present study did not replicate the multidimensional structure of the MHRM and RSA but in each case suggested a single-factor structure, we investigated how much additional information could be obtained by using original authors’ subscales rather than the total score. The lower section of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731512471861">Table 2</xref> presents the semipartial correlations of each original subscale with the total scale scores of other measures, controlling for the total scale score. This indicates that, for both the MHRM and RSA, when the total score was controlled, the subscales provided very little extra contribution (the semipartial correlations, range = .00–.17, indicating at most a 3% increment in explanatory power) in association with other related constructs.</p>

<title>Convergent and Concurrent Validity</title>
<p>To investigate convergent and concurrent validity of the measures, correlations among the recovery scale scores were estimated. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731512471861">Table 2</xref>, these correlations were all statistically significant and moderately high (i.e., <italic>r </italic>= .39, .41, and .54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). As indicated by the square of the correlations, the recovery measures shared 15–29% of their variance, reflecting meaningful relationships among different aspects of the recovery concept.

<title>Discussion and Application to Social Work</title>
<p>Findings from this study indicate that the two measures of recovery (MHRM, POP) and one measure of recovery-promoting environments (RSA) that were translated into Chinese and investigated in a sample of Hong Kong mental health consumers all have acceptable psychometric properties. Internal consistency reliabilities were very high, indicating only minimal measurement error. Reliability analysis indicated there were no particularly poor items in the scales. Concurrent validity investigations found moderately positive correlations between the MHRM and the RSA measure of a recovery-promoting environment (<italic>r</italic> = .39) as well as to the WHO QOL measure (<italic>r</italic> = .51). Correlations were all consistent with the theoretical expectation of moderate positive relationships in terms of valence, magnitude, and significance.</p>
<p>The significant positive correlation between the MHRM and the POP recovery measures also provides some initial support for their convergent validity. However, the magnitude (<italic>r</italic> = .54) is a bit lower than might be expected, since these instruments are both designed to measure the concept of personal recovery. At this level, the correlation fails to reach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512471861">Cavelti, Kvrgic, Beck, Kossowsky, and Vauth’ (2012</xref>; relatively high) “critical level of .70 for convergent validity” (p. 24). This can occur for several reasons. Perhaps the scales are not truly measuring the same concepts (i.e., they were developed in different locations, with different groups of consumers, and do not contain the same components of recovery). It is also possible that, since these measures were directly translated from English into Chinese, rather than being developed in Hong Kong, they may not encompass all of the culturally important aspects of recovery for mental health consumers in Hong Kong. In addition, it may be reasonable to expect more variability, and hence less shared variance, when translating an instrument into a different language and applying it cross-culturally.</p>
<p>In relation to the factor structure of the MHRM and RSA, our results did not confirm the multiple-factor structures found in previous investigations. Although both scales were developed to measure multiple domains of recovery, in our investigation, the items and the subscales were significantly correlated and, more importantly, factor analysis tended to suggest only a single factor underlying the scales. Consistent with results from our factor analysis, semipartial correlations indicated there was very little gain in explanatory power that could be derived from using the subscale scores, as opposed to simply using the total scale scores. Therefore, preliminarily, it seems that differentiation of various dimensions in the scales may not be necessary, at least among the Hong Kong sample in the current study.</p>
<p>The present study is one of the first to validate recovery measures among a Chinese sample in Hong Kong. However, several limitations are to be kept in mind in understanding the findings. First, as it is not easy to obtain a representative sample of people with mental illness, our sample was obtained from a local NGO, which is one of the major service providers for mental health care. Although the participants were recruited from different districts in Hong Kong, to what extent they are representative of the total mental health clientele in terms of demographic backgrounds (e.g., educational level, religious belief, age, etc.) is unknown. In addition, most subjects were living in the hostels provided by the NGO. This could give rise to concern for social desirability bias, particularly in assessing the recovery-promoting environment (RSA). However, the mean RSA score in our study is actually a bit lower than that reported by the original authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049731512471861">O’Connell, Tondora, Croog, Evans, &amp; Davidson, 2005b</xref>; 3.73 [.76] vs. 4.06 [.69]), helping alleviate this concern. Many Chinese psychiatric patients tend to be taken care of by their families due to the cultural influences of collectivism and an emphasis on social harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049731512471861">Yip, 2004</xref>). Differences between clients living in these different environments, as well as the influences of a supervised residential facility compared to a home-living environment are also unknown.</p>
<p>The recent movement in the mental health field toward a recovery-oriented framework has substantial implications for research and practice. Research has begun to develop instruments designed to measure recovery from different perspectives, yet there is still need for greater consensus on the definition and measurement of recovery.</p>
<p>This translation of two recovery instruments and one measure of recovery-promoting environments and investigation of their psychometric properties is intended as a step toward developing reliable, valid, and culturally relevant measures of mental health recovery in the Hong Kong context. Yet, there is also need for theory development and greater cross-cultural sensitivity in the development of recovery measures. An exploratory investigation into whether additional aspects of recovery (from the perspective of Hong Kong mental health consumers) should be incorporated into existing measures seems indicated.</p>
<p>This is important since the definition of recovery may reasonably be expected to vary across cultures. In fact, early roots of the recovery concept can be found in the ancient Chinese text <italic>I-Ching </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049731512471861">Wilhelm &amp; Baynes, 1977</xref>), where the meaning is one of regaining energy and vitality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049731512471861">Tse et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, the aspect of energy and vitality does not appear to be directly identified in either the POP or the MHRM. In addition, there may be aspects of recovery in a Chinese society that appropriately reflects the more communal nature of Asian cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731512471861">Song &amp; Hsu, 2011</xref>). Cross-cultural investigation of recovery measurement in different cultures can enhance our understanding of both the universal and the culture-specific aspects of the concept.</p>
<p>In practice, the development of recovery measures and measures of recovery-promoting environments is both a step toward and a tool to facilitate the reorientation of the mental health system. We must first measure recovery and recovery-promoting environments before we can investigate whether and to what extent “recovery promoting environments” actually promote recovery. Therefore, the development of culturally relevant, reliable, and valid measures of recovery is an essential prerequisite to promoting a recovery orientation in the mental health system in Hong Kong.</p>
