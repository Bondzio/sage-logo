<abstract>
<p>The current study examines the relationship between therapeutic climate of sexual offender treatment groups, risk level, psychopathy and phase (i.e., early/later) of treatment. The participants were 137 sexual offenders detained indefinitely under Wisconsin’s Sexually Violent Person’s Law who attended a treatment group based on their level of psychopathy: higher levels of psychopathy (i.e., PCL-R scores of 25 or above) or lower levels of psychopathy (i.e., PCL-R scores of less than 25). Using MANOVA with aspects of the therapeutic climate as the dependent variables, the therapeutic climate did not differ as a function of the risk level of the participants. However, the overall therapeutic climate of the two treatment tracks (Lower vs. Higher PCL-R) differed significantly. The mean therapeutic climate scores for both treatment tracks were in the medium to high range (with exception of group cohesion, which was low in the Higher PCL-R track), indicating a fairly positive therapeutic climate in both treatment tracks overall. The therapeutic climate also differed as a function of phase of treatment for each of the treatment tracks, with some aspects being rated more positively early in treatment and others in more positively in later phases. In particular, group cohesion was viewed more positively for the Higher PCL-R group in later phases of treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A number of authors have suggested that risk, need, and responsivity issues (RNR) are important factors to consider in the treatment of sexual offenders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1079063212443384">Andrews &amp; Bonta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1079063212443384">Looman, Dickie, &amp; Abracen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1079063212443384">Marshall et al., 2005</xref>; Ward &amp; Stewart, 2006). As regards these RNR principles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1079063212443384">Hanson, Bourgon, Helmus, and Hodgson (2009)</xref> examined 23 studies (<italic>n</italic> = 6,746) that met the basic RNR criteria. Studies that adhered to all three RNR principles were found to produce recidivism rates (10.9%) that were nearly half of the recidivism rates of comparison groups (19.2%). Treatment that followed none of the RNR principles were found to have had little effect in reducing recidivism levels.</p>
<p>Despite the focus on RNR principles, the therapeutic climate has often been neglected with a few important exceptions (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063212443384">Beech &amp; Fordham, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063212443384">Jennings &amp; Sawyer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1079063212443384">Langton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1079063212443384">Marshall et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1079063212443384">Marshall &amp; Serran, 2000</xref>) even though this has been shown to be an important factor in treatment effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063212443384">Beech &amp; Hamilton-Giachritsis, 2005</xref>). The therapeutic climate of a group refers to the context in which treatment occurs. It can encompass a range of factors such as therapist characteristics, the therapeutic relationship, and the interrelationships between individuals in a group.</p>
<p>Of course, RNR principles can influence therapeutic climate. For example, offenders with an extensive criminal history (typically indicated by high-risk level), may indulge in extensive rule-breaking/impulsive behaviors, which by definition have a negative impact on the therapeutic climate in group-based treatment. The quality of the therapeutic climate can also be considered an external responsivity factor that would affect the offender’s ability to derive benefit from treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1079063212443384">Looman, Dickie, et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Another potentially relevant factor influencing the group process is phase of treatment that the individual is in. It is possible that the more advanced the phase of treatment a person reaches, the more positive they might view the group. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1079063212443384">Yalom (1995)</xref> notes, different processes occur through three different stages of treatment. The <italic>initial stage</italic> is characterized by initial orientation to the group, hesitant participation, search for meaning, and dependency. It might be expected that at this stage, the groups would report higher levels of facilitator control and a focus on concrete, practical tasks and decision making, but lower levels of facilitator support. The facilitator may take a more active role initially, as the individuals seek guidance on how groups should function, but the individuals may not feel as supported by the facilitator as they might hope, given the level of dependency they are experiencing. The <italic>second stage</italic> is characterized by conflict, dominance, and rebellion. It would be expected at this stage that group members would report higher levels of anger and aggression being expressed. Finally, the <italic>third stage</italic> is characterized as the development of “cohesiveness”—the feeling of belonging to, and valuing of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1079063212443384">Yalom, 1995</xref>). At this stage, it would be expected that the individuals would feel more supported by the facilitator; have a better understanding of the structure and rules of the group; have higher levels of expressiveness; and increased self-discovery alongside increased cohesion within the group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063212443384">Houston, Wrench, and Hosking (1995)</xref> studied the group process of two sex offender groups made up of child abusers to determine how they adhered to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1079063212443384">Yalom’s (1985)</xref> three stages of group development. They found support for each of the stages described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1079063212443384">Yalom (1985)</xref> amongst the two groups that were examined.</p>
<p>Psychopathy (as an internal responsivity factor) would appear to have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of treatment, for the individual, and (as an external responsivity factor) for other nonpsychopathic individuals in the same treatment group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1079063212443384">Beech, Fisher, &amp; Beckett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063212443384">Harkins &amp; Beech, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063212443384">Looman et al., 2005</xref>). Psychopathy is a condition marked by (a) self-serving interpersonal traits (e.g., grandiosity), pathological lying, manipulativeness, shallow affect (e.g., lack of emotional depth), lack of empathy, guilt, or remorse; and (b) a set of broadly antisocial traits (e.g., impulsivity, persistent violation of social norms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063212443384">Hare, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Some studies have seemed to indicate that treatment may make highly psychopathic men worse (i.e., more likely to recidivate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1079063212443384">Hare, Clarke, Grann, &amp; Thornton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063212443384">Looman, Abracen, Serin, &amp; Marquis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1079063212443384">Rice, Harris, &amp; Cormier, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1079063212443384">Seto &amp; Barbaree, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1079063212443384">Rice and colleagues (1992)</xref> found that, compared to nonpsychopaths, treatment was associated with an increase in violent recidivism for psychopaths. Two other studies concluded that those offenders who scored high in psychopathy and who performed better in treatment were more likely to recidivate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063212443384">Looman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1079063212443384">Seto &amp; Barbaree, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>However, some problems with studies indicating negative treatment outcome for psychopaths should be noted and some evidence suggests that psychopaths do not invariably have high recidivism rates. In terms of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1079063212443384">Rice et al. (1992)</xref> study, the treatment program is recognized as being complex and controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063212443384">Hare, 2003</xref>), and is not representative of current treatment programs. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063212443384">Langton, Barbaree, Harkins, and Peacock (2006)</xref> noted that there was actually no difference in the failure rate of the two high PCL-R groups, implicating a main effect for the PCL-R rather than an interaction effect in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063212443384">Looman et al. (2005)</xref> study. A recent reanalysis of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1079063212443384">Seto and Barbaree (1999)</xref> sample, using a longer follow-up time and a more comprehensive source for recidivism data, has demonstrated that the effect observed on the original study has not been maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063212443384">Barbaree, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1079063212443384">Seto, 2003</xref>). In fact, a newer study has demonstrated an opposite effect to those found by the previous studies discussed. Here, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063212443384">Langton and colleagues (2006)</xref> found that among sexual offenders with PCL-R scores of 25 or higher, those with ratings reflecting a more negative response to treatment recidivated sexually at a faster rate than those with high scores who performed well in treatment. This study used a sample size that was twice as large as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1079063212443384">Seto and Barbaree (1999)</xref> study, had a longer follow-up, used Cox regression survival analysis, and used a statistical test of moderation.</p>
<p>Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1079063212443384">Abracen, Looman, Ferguson, Harkins, &amp; Mailloux, 2010</xref>) have also found that sex offenders with high PCL-R who attended sex offender treatment, and a comparison group who did not attend sex offender treatment (but many of whom attended other forms of correctional programming) had quite low rates of sexual recidivism (about 6% for the combined group (<italic>n</italic> = 31) with no differences in the recidivism rates of the groups). These results suggest that psychopathic sex offenders do not invariably have high rates of recidivism.</p>
<p>Reviews have also called into question the suggestion that psychopaths as a group are “untreatable” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1079063212443384">Abracen, Looman, &amp; Langton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1079063212443384">Doren &amp; Yates, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1079063212443384">D’Silva, Duggan, &amp; McCarthy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1079063212443384">Loving, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1079063212443384">Olver &amp; Wong, 2009</xref>). These articles have reviewed the available literature on the treatment of psychopaths and concluded that there is not enough evidence to support the view that men who score high on the PCL-R have a negative response to treatment. It is possible that psychopathy presents an obstacle to therapy because psychopaths are seen as more of a challenge to treat than nonpsychopaths, but they may be treatable nonetheless. In particular, it is possible that psychopaths do not respond well to traditional treatment programs but may be more responsive to programs designed specifically to meet their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1079063212443384">Hare, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1079063212443384">Thornton &amp; Blud, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1079063212443384">Wong &amp; Hare, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of “treatment-interfering” characteristics are associated with psychopathy (e.g., arrogance, a deceptive interpersonal style, shallow affect; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1079063212443384">Thornton &amp; Blud, 2007</xref>). Thus, for men who score high in psychopathy, as measured by the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063212443384">Hare, 2003</xref>), it is important to offer treatment in a manner that takes their characteristics into consideration. Hence, current treatment providers have a more optimistic view of the effectiveness of treatment for psychopaths (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1079063212443384">Hare, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1079063212443384">Thornton &amp; Blud, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1079063212443384">Wong &amp; Hare, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The current study was carried out as an attempt to examine the relationship between therapeutic climate of sexual offender treatment groups, risk level, psychopathy (in a treatment program that addresses responsivity as it is designed for psychopaths), and phase of treatment. The following hypotheses were examined in the research described here:</p>
<list id="list1-1079063212443384" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: That therapeutic climate would differ as a function of risk category, with high-risk offenders perceiving the therapeutic climate less positively than low risk offenders.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>This hypothesis is based on previous research demonstrating differential treatment responses for different risk categories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1079063212443384">Andrews &amp; Dowden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063212443384">Friendship, Mann, &amp; Beech, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1079063212443384">Stirpe, Wilson, &amp; Long, 2001</xref>).</p>
<list id="list2-1079063212443384" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Higher psychopathy scorers (PCL-R of 25 or above) will report a less positive therapeutic climate than those in the lower psychopathy scores (PCL-R scores below 25).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>This is based on previous research suggesting the role of psychopathy as an obstacle to treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1079063212443384">Beech et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<list id="list3-1079063212443384" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Therapeutic climate of the group will differ as a function of phase of treatment.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>This is based <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1079063212443384">Yalom’s (1995)</xref> description of different processes occurring during different stages of treatment and the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1079063212443384">Stirpe et al. (2001)</xref> regarding the attainment of treatment goals at different stage of treatment. Specifically, the following differences are hypothesized: (3a) In the earlier phase, individuals in groups will report perceiving higher levels of facilitator control and a focus on concrete, practical tasks and decision making, but lower levels of facilitator support; (3b) In later phases of treatment, it is predicted that higher levels of anger and aggression would be expressed but increasing perceptions of cohesiveness, leader support, order and organization, higher levels of expressiveness, and increased self-discovery; (3c) Treatment groups with high psychopathy scorers will differ from those with low psychopathy scorers across treatment phases with high PCL-R scorers perceiving less cohesive groups and higher expression of anger and aggression.</p>

<title>Setting and Program Ethos</title>
<p>Sand Ridge Secure Treatment Center (SRSTC), in Wisconsin, United States, offers a range of treatment programs designed to meet the specific needs of sexually violent persons detained under Wisconsin’s Sexually Violent Persons law. This facility offers treatment, progressing though several phases, addressing the needs of sexual offenders differing by level of psychopathy and IQ. All treatment tracks address issues surrounding the following criminogenic need areas: <italic>sexual interests, distorted attitudes, socioaffective functioning</italic>, and <italic>self-management</italic>. These areas are targeted in treatment using a multidisciplinary approach. The program is based on a psychosocial rehabilitation model with an emphasis on cognitive-behavioral and relapse prevention techniques. The length of time in treatment is dependent on successful program completion as evidenced by the patient’s consistent demonstration of mastery of self-management skills. Treatment addresses patients’ understanding of their thoughts, attitudes, emotions, behaviors, and sexual arousal linked to their sex offending, and identifying when these occur. To be considered for release, the patient must demonstrate that they have sustained change in their thoughts, attitudes, emotions, behaviors, and their management of arousal. Furthermore, in order for it to be reasonably assumed that the changes made can be maintained and continued through treatment in the community, achievement must be demonstrated in all domains over a considerable time period.</p>
<p>The high PCL-R treatment track, while still addressing the same four criminogenic need areas as the low PCL-R track, specifically addresses psychopathy as a responsivity factor in that treatment is offered in a manner that is expected to sustain the interest and motivation of men who score highly on the PCL-R. Namely, attempts are not made to specifically address criminogenic needs that are closely linked to underlying psychopathic traits (e.g., empathy) as these will not be amenable to change; treatment is designed to account for the treatment-interfering factors (e.g., grandiosity, impulsivity) associated with psychopathy, and clinical methods that are vulnerable to treatment interfering factors, such as a reliance on self-disclosure, are avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1079063212443384">Thornton &amp; Blud, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, staff training and procedures are put in place to maintain boundaries and minimize opportunities for manipulation, there is less reliance on assessment measures that are vulnerable to deception and manipulation, and attempts are made to appeal to the common motivations of psychopaths (e.g., self-interest, status) rather than those that are not likely to be relevant to psychopathic individuals (e.g., altruism, deep emotional needs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1079063212443384">Thornton &amp; Blud, 2007</xref>). Finally, attempts are made to ensure that prosocial behavior leads to more positive consequences than antisocial behavior, fluctuations in behavior do not greatly reduce provision of treatment services, and by responding to diversity even within those who score highly in psychopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1079063212443384">Thornton &amp; Blud, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1079063212443384">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>One hundred and thirty-seven sexual offenders detained indefinitely under Wisconsin’s Sexually Violent Persons law took part in the study. These were a subset of the 272 patients currently undertaking treatment at the facility. The additional 135 of the 272 patients did not take part for a variety of reasons including that approximately 50 patients were not in treatment at the time of the research, approximately another 50 were not selected due to their lower level of functioning, and the remainder chose not to take part for various reasons, such as that their case was still in court.</p>
<p>The participants attended one of four treatment tracks, depending on IQ and level of psychopathy. The first treatment track, referred to as <italic>Corrective Thinking</italic> is for men with average IQ levels and high levels of psychopathy (i.e., PCL-R scores of 25 or above). The second treatment track is called <italic>Adapted Corrective Thinking</italic> for men with below average IQs and high levels of psychopathy (25 or above). The third treatment track, referred to as <italic>Conventional</italic>, is for those men with average IQs and with lower levels of psychopathy (i.e., PCL-R scores of less than 25). The fourth, referred to as <italic>Compass</italic>, is for men with below average IQs and lower levels of psychopathy (i.e., PCL-R scores of less than 25). The participants were on treatment Phase 1, 2, or 3, depending on how much progress they had made in treatment. There were only 3 participants in Phase 3 therefore they were combined with the participants in Phase 2 to create two groups: Phase 1 and Phase 2/3.</p>
<p>To ensure roughly equal sample sizes for analyses, the Corrective Thinking and Adapted Corrective Thinking treatment tracks for men with high PCL-R scores (≥25) were combined into one sample of participants who attended a higher PCL-R treatment track (<italic>n</italic> = 73; 55 in Phase 1 and 18 in Phase 2/3 of treatment) . The Conventional and Compass treatment tracks for men with lower PCL-R score (&lt;25) were combined into a second sample of men who attended a lower PCL-R treatment track (<italic>n</italic> = 64; 42 in Phase 1, <italic>n</italic> = 22 in Phase 2/3). The proportion of men in each phase/treatment track was roughly equivalent, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 1.55, <italic>ns</italic>.</p>
<p>The mean age at testing of the sample was 42.8 (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.0). The average risk level of the sample was High ascertained by Risk Matrix 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1079063212443384">Thornton et al., 2003</xref>) scores. In terms of ethnicity, 71% (<italic>n</italic> = 96) of the sample were White, 15% (<italic>n</italic> = 21) Black, 13% (<italic>n</italic> = 18) Native American, and 1% (<italic>n</italic> = 1) of the sample was Hispanic. The mean PCL-R score for the sample was 24.3 (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.4).The mean IQ for the sample was 95.3 (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.1). The mean number of prior sentencing dates for sexual offenses was two. More than half of the sample (58%, <italic>n</italic> = 78) had committed offenses against both child and adult victims, 13% (<italic>n</italic> = 17) had only adult victims, and 30% (<italic>n</italic> = 40) had only child victims. All of the participants had at least one unrelated victim, except for 1 man who only had related victims. A small percentage (11%, <italic>n</italic> = 15) had a violent conviction at the same time they were sentenced for their index offense and 44% (<italic>n</italic> = 61) had a violent conviction at some point in their past. The mean number of prior sentencing dates for any offense was 5.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.0) and the mean number on nonsexual, nonviolent offenses was 3.3 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.7).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were approached by their treatment providers during one of their treatment sessions and provided with an information sheet. For those who consented to participate, times were arranged for them to complete the Group Environment Scale (GES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063212443384">Moos, 2002</xref>) and the Paulhus Deception Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1079063212443384">Paulhus, 1998</xref>) with the first author who does not work at the treatment facility. Participants completed the GES and PDS individually to increase the response rate and increase the offender’s confidence that their individual responses would not be made available to the treatment providers. Following the completion of the GES and PDS, demographic and treatment information was collected using the clinical files of the participants. This information was gathered at SRSTC using treatment progress notes (completed for each offender every 3 months), treatment learning plans, and annual treatment progress reports.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section8-1079063212443384">
<title>Group Environment Scale (GES)</title>
<p>The GES was used to describe and compare groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063212443384">Moos, 2002</xref>). It is a 90-item self-report measure containing scales that examine respondent’s perceptions of the overall climate of different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063212443384">Moos, 2002</xref>). It contains 10 subscales: Cohesion, which measures member’s group involvement in and commitment to the group and the concern and friendship they show for one another; Leader Support, which measures the amount of help, concern, and friendship the leader shows for the members; Expressiveness, which measures how much freedom of action and expression of feelings are encouraged in the group; Independence, which measures how much the group encourages independent action and expression among members; Task Orientation, which measures how much emphasis is placed on completing concrete, practical tasks and on decision making and training; Self-Discovery, which measures how much the group encourages member’s discussions of personal problems; Anger and Aggression, which measures the extent to which there is open expression of anger and disagreement in the group; Order and Organization, which measures the formality and structure of the group and the explicitness of rules and sanctions; Leader Control, which measures the extent to which the leader directs the group, makes decisions, and enforces rules; and Innovation, which measures how much the group promotes diversity and change in its own functions and activities. These scales have been standardized on a large number of groups allowing for the interpretation of group profiles. There is evidence for the internal consistency and the test-retest reliability over a 1 month interval.</p>
<p>The mean overall GES profile stability ranged from .92 after 4 months to .78 after 2 years indicating that these profiles may be relatively stable for as long as 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063212443384">Moos, 2002</xref>). The intercorrelations show the scales to be distinct measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063212443384">Moos, 2002</xref>). The GES has been used previously to compare the group environment of different sex offender groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063212443384">Beech &amp; Fordham, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063212443384">Beech &amp; Hamilton-Giachritsis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063212443384">Harkins &amp; Beech, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, for groups in which scores were available for most of the group members (5+ individuals), Intraclass correlations were calculated to determine the degree of agreement in different participant’s scores on the GES subscales. For all the groups except two, the individual’s scores within the group were significantly correlated with one another (.42-.90). For the two groups in which the scores were not significantly correlated, these approached significance (i.e., <italic>p</italic> &lt; .06). It could be argued that the more similar the rating, perhaps the closer the ratings are to representing a more objective view of the therapeutic climate.</p>

<sec id="section9-1079063212443384">
<title>Psychopathy Checklist—Revised (PCL-R)</title>
<p>The PCL-R is a clinical assessment instrument developed to assess psychopathic personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063212443384">Hare, 2003</xref>). It is comprised of 20 items, rated on a 3-point scale that are scored on the basis of a semistructured interview and file review. A cut-off score of 25 was used to diagnose psychopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1079063212443384">Harris, Rice, &amp; Quinsey, 1994</xref>). It has been widely demonstrated to be a reliable and valid instrument with acceptable psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063212443384">Hare, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1079063212443384">Salekin, Rogers, &amp; Sewell, 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1079063212443384">
<title>Risk Matrix 2000 (RM 2000)</title>
<p>The RM 2000 was developed to assess risk for sexual recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1079063212443384">Thornton et al., 2003</xref>). It is widely used throughout the United Kingdom with the Prison, Probation, and Police Services in England and Wales having adopted the scale nationally. Calculating a RM2000 score consists of two steps. The first step involves the consideration of three static items: age at commencement of risk, number of sexual appearances, and total criminal appearances. The individual is placed in a Low, Medium, High, or Very High risk category based on the points awarded. The second step contains four aggravating factors. These are male victim, stranger victim, noncontact sexual offenses and lack of a long-term intimate relationship. If two aggravating factors are present, the risk category is raised one level and if all four are present, risk is raised by two levels. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) statistic for RM2000 were .75 and .77 for the samples used to develop it, indicating a good level of predictive accuracy. Independent studies have also found good levels of predictive accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063212443384">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063212443384">Kingston, Yates, Firestone, Babchishin, &amp; Bradford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063212443384">Looman &amp; Abracen, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1079063212443384">
<title>Paulhus Deception Scale (PDS)</title>
<p>The PDS is a 40-item measure designed to determine the validity of responses on self-report measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1079063212443384">Paulhus, 1998</xref>). Socially desirable responding is divided into two subscales. The Impression Management Scale aims to detect lying or faking. The Self-Deceptive Enhancement Scale measures the extent to which an individual has insight. There is good evidence for the reliability and validity of this measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1079063212443384">Paulhus, 1998</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-1079063212443384">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Descriptive information was compared between the two treatment tracks. Correlations were used to examine the relationship between the PDS and GES to ascertain the validity of the participant’s responses on the GES. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance and Variance (MANCOVA) were used to examine the relationship between the categorical independent variables (risk, category, treatment track and phase) on the continuous dependent variables (GES subscale scores)</p>

<title>Test of Hypothesis 1: Risk and Therapeutic Climate</title>
<p>A MANOVA was carried out, with risk category as the grouping variable and the 10 GES subscales as the dependent variables, to determine if the therapeutic climate of a group differed depending on risk level. Risk was dichotomized with the Low, Medium, and High risk category participants (<italic>n</italic> = 72) compared to the Very High risk category participants (<italic>n</italic> = 63). There was no significant main effect indicating the overall group environment did not differ as a function of risk category.

<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063212443384">Table 1</xref>, these groups differed as expected in terms of PCL-R score. They also differed by age at testing with men in the lower PCL-R group being significantly older than the higher PCL-R group. The higher PCL-R group also had significantly more prior sentencing dates. But, importantly, the overall risk level of the groups did not differ. Age at testing and number of prior sentencing dates were therefore entered as covariates in the examination of differences between the lower and higher PCL-R treatment tracks.</p>
<p>A MANCOVA was carried out with treatment track as the grouping variable, age at testing and number of prior sentencing dates as covariates, and the 10 GES subscales as the dependent variables. This MANCOVA was significant, <italic>F</italic>(10/122) = 1.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, indicating that the overall group environment differed depending on whether someone was in one of the higher PCL-R treatment tracks versus those in the lower PCL-R treatment tracks. Scores for the subscales that were significant on the univariate F-tests within the MANCOVA, and the means for each treatment track are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1079063212443384">Table 2</xref>. It should also be noted that Levene’s test of equality of error variance indicated unequal error variance for the following subscales: Leader Support, Order and Organization, and Leader Control. Therefore Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests were used to examine if these differences were significant. The two treatment tracks differed significantly in terms of cohesion, leader support, leader support, task orientation, self-discovery, anger and aggression, order and organization, and leader control.</p>

Higher scores represent a higher perceived level of this particular variable (e.g., a more cohesive group or higher levels of anger and aggression expressed). Generally, this represents more positive ratings on the subscale although one could argue that lower levels of perceived anger and aggression would be more positive; therefore, this would be interpreted as more positive the lower the rating.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined differences in the therapeutic climate in treatment programs at Sand Ridge Secure Treatment Center as a function of risk category, treatment track (based on PCL-R scores), and phase of treatment. The therapeutic climate did not differ as a function of the risk level of the participants. As anticipated, the overall therapeutic climate of the two treatment tracks (lower vs. higher PCL-R) was worse in some respects for the higher PCL-R treatment track. The group environment differed as a function of phase of treatment for each of the treatment tracks, with some aspects being rated more positively in Phase 1 and others in Phase 2/3. The interaction between treatment track and treatment phase was not significant on the whole indicating that for the most part, those in later phases of treatment report similar therapeutic climates. The individual subscales of cohesion and anger and aggression were examined as there were a priori assumptions that the therapeutic climate would differ on these subscales as a result of psychopathy level in later phases of treatment. The level of cohesion was reported as higher by those in later phases in the higher PCL-R group suggesting that those who make it to later phases of treatment feel a high level of cohesion with their group. Levels of anger and aggression were significantly lower in both treatment tracks at later phases of treatment.</p>
<p>The overall group environment did not differ as a function of static risk level. However, nearly all of the participants scored High or Very High on the Risk Matrix 2000. It is possible therefore, that an effect of risk level was not observed because of the limited number of Low (<italic>n</italic> = 3) to Medium (<italic>n</italic> = 27) risk compared to High (<italic>n</italic> = 42) and Very High (<italic>n</italic> = 63) participants. Another possibility is that the risk level of the participant does not have a bearing on the relationships between the members of the group. It may be that static risk category does not reflect the interpersonal characteristics related to the ability to engage in and encourage a positive therapeutic climate.</p>
<p>The therapeutic climate of the group differed between the Lower and Higher PCL-R treatment tracks. In particular, those in the Lower PCL-R treatment track groups reported they felt their groups were more cohesive, that they had more leader support, that there was more of an emphasis on concrete, practical tasks and decision making (i.e., Task Orientation), that the groups were formal and structured and the rules and sanctions were explicit (i.e., Order and Organization), and that the leader directed the group, made decisions, and enforced rules (i.e., Leader Control). Those in the Higher PCL-R group felt their group had a more open expression of anger and disagreement. These results might be expected based on the characteristics associated with those who score high in psychopathy (e.g., manipulative, callous/lack of empathy, poor behavioral controls, impulsivity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063212443384">Hare, 2003</xref>) that may make them more likely to be involved in behavior that could cause conflict within the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063212443384">Caldwell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1079063212443384">Howells, Krishnan, &amp; Daffern, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Several aspects considered important in terms of promoting a positive group process (e.g., Cohesion, Leader Support) were found to be higher in the Lower PCL-R treatment track. However, other aspects such as the expressiveness of the group did not differ between the groups, indicating the overall group environment of the Higher PCL-R treatment track groups was not negative on the whole. The mean GES group scores for both treatment tracks were in the medium to high range (with one exception), indicating a fairly positive therapeutic climate in both treatment tracks overall. The one exception to this was the Cohesion subscale for the higher PCL-R treatment track, which was in the low range of GES scores. Again, the cohesiveness of the group is likely to be influenced by the interpersonal characteristics associated with those who score high in psychopathy (e.g., grandiose sense of self-worth, shallow affect, callousness), making it more difficult for them to feel and demonstrate concern and friendship for other group members. Cohesion was found to be significantly higher though, amongst those in the second phase of treatment for the Higher PCL-R treatment track. Although the program was not specifically designed to increase group cohesion, it would be expected for those in later phases of treatment, more treatment interfering factors (e.g., manipulative behavior) may have been addressed and this would likely result in a more cohesive group. This suggests that difficulties in treating those who score highly in psychopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1079063212443384">Hare et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063212443384">Hare &amp; Neumann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063212443384">Hobson, Shine, &amp; Roberts, 2000</xref>) could potentially be overcome. However, these results are tentative and much more evidence is needed before conclusions can be drawn in this regard.</p>
<p>It is also worth considering that individuals scoring highly in psychopathy might report a more positive therapeutic climate because they are in groups with others who score similarly high. If the groups contained low scorers and high scorers combined, it might be more likely that a less positive group environment would be perceived. In such mixed groups it would be more likely that the therapeutic climate for these low scorers would be adversely influenced by sharing the group with high scores who may be trying to dominate or manipulate them.</p>
<p>There was an overall difference in therapeutic climate between early and later phases of treatment. Half of the scales did not differ by phase suggesting a comparable therapeutic climate in many respects. As would be expected from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1079063212443384">Yalom’s (1995)</xref> work, the level of cohesion, leader support, and perceived order and organization were reported to be higher in later phases. However, in contrast to what would be expected based on the stages of treatment outlined by Yalom, those in later phases reported lower levels expressiveness and anger and aggression. Although higher levels of anger and aggression were expected as the middle phases of treatment generally reflect a time of conflict, dominance, and rebellion within the group, it is positive that lower levels of anger and aggression are reported by those in later phases. Ideally, one would like to see groups in the final phase of treatment having moved past this stage of conflict and as generally more cohesive. However, one would hope that lower levels of expressed anger and aggression were not reflective of lower levels of expressiveness in general. As this may have been the case here, these results also suggest that perhaps in later phases of treatment more effort needs to be made to encourage group members to feel free to express themselves.</p>
<p>Cohesion and anger and aggression were also examined by treatment track and phase. Encouragingly, for both treatment tracks and phases, the level of anger and aggression that was expressed was lower in later phases. For those in the Higher PCL-R treatment track, a significantly higher rating in an important aspect of the group environment (i.e., cohesion) is observed. This suggests that for those who progress to higher phases of treatment, their perception of the group environment is higher than those in early phases. Such a difference in perceived level of cohesion was not observed by individuals in the earlier and later phases of the lower PCL-R treatment track as these levels were relatively higher to start with. In fact, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1079063212443384">Table 4</xref>, for high PCL-R individuals in the later phase of treatment, the perceived level of cohesiveness is the same as that of the low PCL-R treatment track in the first phase of treatment. As the group members in the higher PCL-R track move to later phases of treatment, they will have had more experience addressing their treatment-interfering factors, therefore those who progress to later stages may be easier for the other group members to engage with.</p>
<p>It has been noted that individuals who score high in psychopathy tend to negatively affect the therapeutic aspects of groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1079063212443384">Howells et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1079063212443384">Langton, 2007</xref>), often resulting in their removal from treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063212443384">Caldwell et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, it is generally true in this study, that when collapsed across treatment phase, the high PCL group scored more negatively. However if a treatment program is designed to retain individuals with characteristics that can make treatment challenging (such as those associated with psychopathy), then these results suggest that a positive therapeutic climate is possible for those who progress to later phases.</p>
<sec id="section19-1079063212443384">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. As this is a between subjects design, we do not know if the subjects in each phase were equivalent. There may have also been a selection bias as only 137 of the 272 offenders currently in treatment at the facility agreed to participate in the study and it is possible that those who agreed to take part were those who saw treatment quite positively. However, some of these participants were not in treatment at the time of the research, thus their participation would not be appropriate as the GES would not be applicable. Many of the others were not eligible because their level of functioning was too low for them to meaningfully complete the questionnaires.</p>
<p>Also, it would have been useful to have included information about treatment change on relevant treatment targets. Although data was collected with the intention to looking at this, we only discovered in the second data collection stage (at 8 months follow-up from the time the GES was completed) that the information we were collecting (i.e., concerns noted in their file material in terms of deviant sexual interest, distorted attitudes, socioaffective functioning, and self-management problems) was confounded with what was being covered in treatment during that data collection period. For example, more concerns might have been noted in the second data collection stage with regard to distorted attitudes simply because the person was taking part in exercises that were designed to address these, but that does not mean the person got worse in this area. If given the opportunity to develop or implement new treatment programs, embedding procedures allowing for evaluation of within-treatment change and other treatment-related indicators is advisable to allow for a triangulated approach to measuring outcome.</p>
<p>It would have been useful to collect additional information about treatment change and therapeutic climate from the group facilitators. This information was not originally included in the treatment design because of the possibility of the ratings being biased by the facilitator’s professional relationship with the participants and their investment in the participant’s successful treatment. Indeed, previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063212443384">Beech &amp; Fordham, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063212443384">Beech &amp; Hamilton-Giachritsis, 2005</xref>) has found that the ratings of group environment differed between facilitators and group members, with the facilitators rating the group environment as more positive in some respects. However, the information available from the facilitators would have been useful, as they are much more familiar with the participants and would have personal knowledge of issues that may not have been discussed in file material.</p>
<p>Similarly, it would have been useful to include a qualitative component to the study. This would have allowed for a rich source of information about how the individuals feel about their groups. There might be aspects of the group environment that are important but are not included in the GES. Allowing participants the flexibility of providing more detailed answers through an interview format might have illustrated these other important components.</p>
<p>Furthermore, future research should consider the use other measures of biased responding. Following the completion of this research, the conceptual and empirical validity of the practice of using the PDS to adjust for social desirability is increasingly questioned (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1079063212443384">Uziel, 2010</xref>) both with offender and nonoffender samples.</p>
<p>It should be acknowledged that we recognize that the results of this study are preliminary. A number of important factors are likely to influence the therapeutic climate of a group. This study highlights one in particular: level of psychopathic traits. Further work looking at how psychopathy affects on the therapeutic climate is necessary to draw firmer conclusions. Additionally, other factors such denial and motivation of participants that could have an influence on the therapeutic climate need to be explored.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study provided some interesting preliminary results, in terms of the influence of psychopathy on the therapeutic climate of a sexual offender treatment group, in a treatment program designed to consider psychopathy as a responsivity factor. The therapeutic climate was less positive in the Higher PCL-R treatment track; however, the overall group environment of this treatment track was generally acceptable, with improved ratings on two important aspects (i.e., cohesion and anger and aggression) in later phases of treatment. This study indicates that, although there may be particular difficulties in treating men who score high in psychopathy (e.g., low levels of cohesion in early phases of treatment), these rating are significantly higher for those who progress to later phases. Further work should be completed to replicate and expand on these encouraging, albeit preliminary, findings in the hope of improving the treatment for sexual offenders in general, and for those who score high in psychopathy in particular.</p>
