<p>For every activity there is a certain appropriate scale … What scale is appropriate? It depends on what we are trying to do. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094213485529">Schumacher, 2011</xref>: 50)</p></disp-quote>
<p>These sentences from Schumacher's seminal text, originally published in 1973, underpin the explorations of localism in this Special Issue of <italic>Local Economy</italic>. There is increasing emphasis, in research and in policy, on localism – on local, place-based operations and activities, decision-making and resource-allocation processes. Normative arguments exist which support the appropriateness of localism, bringing with them claims for empowerment, capacity building and autonomy.</p>
<p>In this Special Issue, we seek to query assumptions around localism, in order to enhance the accuracy with which localism – and associated concepts – are articulated. We do this by presenting research from a number of countries and perspectives. Despite differences in analytical starting-points as well as geographical and temporal focus, the authors all cite scale as a key attribute of assessing localism and its outcomes. By scale, we mean: time, place and societal change. We mean ‘small’ and ‘big’ (in Schumacher's sense). We mean ‘freedom from, freedom to, and reflection of local identify’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094213485529">Pratchett, 2004</xref>). We also mean the need to distinguish between political rhetoric and experience in communities of place; and identifying who localism is <italic>for</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094213485529">Hildreth, 2011</xref>; Skerratt, 2013).</p>
<p>It is not the intention, in this brief introduction, to summarise the evidence and discourse presented in the following seven articles. Rather, it is possible to identify three broad emergent themes, set out here as a ‘taster’, to entice the reader to explore these further by reading on.</p>
<p>The first theme to emerge is that there are tensions between policy language, structures and processes utilised over time which variously ‘talk of’ localism, and the outcomes for development which result. Andersson and Sjoblom explore the paradigm shift observable in Finland over the past decades, and particularly in the past 10 years, where localism is now largely abandoned with significant consequences for local democracy and development. Bentley and Pugalis similarly explore localist policy discourses and the <italic>Localism Act</italic> in England, identifying an ‘uneasy relationship’ between centralised powers, conditional decentralisation and fragmented localism. They highlight contradictions between the radical policy rhetoric of localism, and localism in action. Woolvin and Hardill contrast the policy rhetoric in England and Scotland, through the lens of localism and voluntarism. They too see a shift in the way that voluntarism, once focused on as bringing benefits and empowerment to individuals and communities, is now increasingly emphasised as the means by which local communities can address local, place-based challenges (including public service reform). On-going impacts on communities’ resilience, rather than simple assumptions linking localism with enhanced community resilience, must, in their view, be explored.</p>
<p>Second, the importance of varying perceptions of ‘local’, and the dynamism of ‘local’ due to mobility, are raised by authors here as key issues. Osti, in his exploration of localism as expressed in Italy, emphasises that small-scale space exists as a matter of perception, and that this perception underpins what is seen as possible in terms of interactions, participation, reciprocity, trust and innovative learning. Coupled with the presence of internal bonds is the significance of simultaneous good relations with the ‘outside world’ – that is, relations and their spatial form. Osti uses a four-dimensional framework (island, ghetto, periphery and network) to analyse localism and the evolution of places from one type to another over time. Carson and Koch's article identifies some similar themes of dynamism and perception – citing cases in Austria and Australia. They argue that places are diverse when their spatial (geographic boundaries), social (demographic boundaries) and temporal scales (single conception of local over time) are taken into account. Their overarching conclusion is that the nature of the local economy looks different depending on the scales at which it is viewed. Further, different actors have very different experiences of the economy depending on the scales at which they personally operate. Specifically, this experience of ‘local’ is inextricably linked with other places through the physical movement (mobility) of people.</p>
<p>The third main theme to emerge across articles concerns how localism works in practice, on the ground, in communities of place. Skerratt and Steiner identify how aspirational language for community development focuses on empowerment, omitting the challenges of capacity building to support that very empowerment. Civil society revivalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213485529">Edwards, 2009</xref>) uncritically state that empowerment, through localism, is inevitable, once ‘voluntary social interaction’ takes place. However, research shows the complexities of localism, and the need to remain sceptical about community rather than indulge in its ‘unmitigated celebration’. Calderwood and Davies examine the need for support at community level, through the example of community retail enterprises. Theoretically ‘freed from burdensome regulation or control’, communities can make decisions that reflect local priorities. However, the authors highlight that there is a problem of what exactly the locality is seeking to be autonomous <italic>from</italic>, and how it can therefore effect outcomes in reality. They identify a key limitation of localism within the retail sector by demonstrating the conflict between the desired objective of local autonomy and the influence of external competitive and consumer forces upon the options available to these shops.</p>
<p>By taking a ‘scalar’ approach to this Special Issue – over space and time – we have presented here a more complex and nuanced picture of localism, as <italic>experienced</italic> rather than simply as described or assumed through policy rhetoric. This matters, since we need to be more articulate, as researchers and in policy, as to ‘what we are trying to do’, and indeed, who the ‘we’ is. By unpacking localism in this way, by focusing on scale, perception and process, we put ourselves in a stronger position to critique, constructively, the on-going assumptions of ‘small is beautiful’, instead focusing on outcomes and distribution of those outcomes.</p>
