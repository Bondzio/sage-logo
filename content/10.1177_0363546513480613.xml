<sec id="section1-0363546513480613">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The shoulder activity score is a valid and reliable shoulder-specific questionnaire that measures a patient’s shoulder activity level over the previous year. No age- and sex-based normative data exist for the shoulder activity score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513480613">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>The hypothesis was that age is inversely related to the shoulder activity score in patients with no history of shoulder symptoms or treatment for a shoulder condition. The authors also tested the hypothesis that in the same population of patients, men are more active with their shoulders than women.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513480613">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513480613">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Participants in 8 age/sex groups, composed of adults aged 18 years and older in the United States, were surveyed via the Internet by a marketing research firm. Participants completed the shoulder activity score and reported their age, sex, and any history of shoulder symptoms or treatment. The survey was sent to 2773 people, with 2403 people completing the entire survey. Participants with a history of shoulder symptoms or treatment were excluded from this analysis, leaving 1625 patients as healthy controls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513480613">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The mean shoulder activity score of healthy controls was 8 ± 5 (range, 0-20). Men scored higher on the shoulder activity score than women of the same age group (9 vs 7, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Shoulder activity scores decreased with age in both men and women (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Men were more likely to participate in contact (15% vs 7.4%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and overhead-throwing sports (19% vs 10%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) than women. Participation in contact and overhead-throwing sports also decreased with age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513480613">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>In healthy controls, the shoulder activity score decreased with age and was lower in women than in men. Participation in contact and overhead-throwing sports decreased in women and older patients. These normative data are an important baseline for comparing untreated and treated shoulder cohorts to better understand the variance in shoulder activity level and how it may relate to clinical outcomes.</p>

<p>Patient-based outcome measures are critical for evaluating treatment efficacy for orthopaedic conditions. Outcome measures in orthopaedics typically assess and quantify patient symptoms or functional disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513480613">8</xref></sup> While function reflects how well a person can perform certain tasks, activity is a measure of how often he or she does certain tasks. A patient’s response to questions evaluating functional disability may be influenced by the overall activity level. In addition, a patient’s perception of treatment can be influenced by the activity level. Furthermore, activity level may be a prognostic factor for clinical outcomes of treatment. When comparing various treatments in randomized controlled trials, patient cohorts would ideally have similar activity levels to avoid biased outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513480613">6</xref></sup> Reliable, valid, and responsive activity scales are available for the knee<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513480613">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513480613">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480613">9</xref></sup> and the ankle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480613">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, the Marx knee activity score was found to be a significant predictor of graft reruptures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480613">5</xref></sup> The shoulder activity score, developed by Brophy et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480613">1</xref></sup> is a reliable, valid, and responsive scale that measures shoulder-specific activity. The activity scale was found to have excellent reliability and construct validity (when compared with a lower extremity activity rating scale,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513480613">6</xref></sup> the Simple Shoulder Test, and self-reported shoulder activity). To appropriately interpret any activity scale, normative data are essential to allow clinicians to make comparisons relative to age- and sex-matched healthy peers. Normative data help clinicians better understand the variance in shoulder activity level and how it may relate to clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to establish age and sex norms for the shoulder activity score using a cross-sectional survey administered to a representative sample of the United States (US) population. We wanted to test the hypotheses that (1) men are more active than women and (2) shoulder activity is inversely proportional to age.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546513480613" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Following approval by the local institutional review board, participants were drawn from TNS Global (London, United Kingdom), a marketing research firm that maintains a large database of people, called TNS Global’s Lightspeed Research Panel, which is matched to the March 2010 Current Population Survey (CPS) Social and Economic Supplement and the 2009 American Community Survey (ACS). The CPS and ACS data are subsets of the census. The TNS Global database is matched to the CPS and ACS data based on a person’s age, sex, household income, household size, race/Hispanic origin, and the 9 census geographic divisions. Potential survey participants from this panel were contacted via e-mail. A 300-person quota was set for 8 age/sex categories (18-30 years, 31-50 years, 51-70 years, and over 70 years for both male and female participants). Once those quotas were reached, potential participants of that age and sex category were excluded. Because the primary goal of this study was to describe the normative values in the general population, our sample size estimate was geared toward precision in our estimate of the normative data values. We did not power the study for our secondary comparisons.</p>
<p>A total of 2773 panel members were invited, and 2403 participants completed the survey. All participants were required to complete the entire survey. Exclusion criteria also included age &lt;18 years and inability to read or understand the questionnaire. TNS Global administered the survey via the Internet and provided a clean data file using commercially available software (Microsoft Excel, Redmond, Washington). There was no incentive for participation. Participants filled out the previously validated shoulder activity scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480613">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The shoulder activity scale asks the patients to rate the frequency (ie, never or less than once a month, once a month, once a week, more than once a week, or daily) with which they complete 5 common activities of the shoulder during their healthiest and most active states within the past year (see the Appendix in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajsm.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://ajsm.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>). Each of the 5 activity items is scored from 0 to 4, with 1 point allocated for each category of increasing frequency. The total numerical activity scale is the sum of the individual activity scores, ranging from a minimum score of 0 points (a patient who answers never or less than once a month for all 5 items) to a maximum score of 20 points (if the patient answered daily for all 5 items).</p>
<p>Patients are also asked 2 multiple choice questions related to their level of sporting competition (ie, without organized officiating, with organized officiating, or at a professional level) involving contact and overhead-throwing sports. It is important to note that the activity scale is designed to measure patients’ overall level of activity. Therefore, patients are asked to indicate how often they performed each activity during their healthiest and most active state in the previous year.</p>
<p>Study participants completed the entire shoulder activity scale and provided basic demographic data including age and sex. Participants were also asked whether they had current shoulder complaints or treatment or previous shoulder surgery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513480613">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.3 of the SAS System for Linux (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Descriptive statistics including means, percentiles, 95% confidence intervals, standard deviations, and ranges were calculated for each age/sex category. Income, race, and type of employment were compared across sex and age groups using multivariable logistic regression in which the characteristic is the dependent variable and sex, age, and the age-sex interaction are independent variables. The interaction between sex and age was the effect of interest. Shoulder activity scores were compared across age groups and sex using analysis of variance (ANOVA) examining the interaction between the age group and sex. Post hoc comparison of each age group (regardless of sex) to the other age groups was calculated using the Tukey adjustment for multiple comparisons. The percentage of participants responding “yes” (either without organized officiating, with organized officiating, or at a professional level) to each of the multiple choice questions was calculated and compared using χ<sup>2</sup> analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The survey was sent to 2773 eligible participants, with 2403 participants completing the entire survey and being included. Participants responding with a history of shoulder symptoms or treatment were excluded from this analysis, leaving 1625 participants as healthy controls. There were a similar number of participants grouped by age and sex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513480613">Table 2</xref>). The prevalence of shoulder symptoms or previous treatment increased with age, as might be expected, from 21.5% for ages 18 to 30 years to 29.7% for ages 31 to 50 years, 41.5% for ages 51 to 70 years, and 36.5% for those over 70 years. Otherwise, the healthy controls did not differ significantly from the other participants in the study. The age/sex groups had similar distributions of income (<italic>P</italic> = .16), race (<italic>P</italic> = .55), and employment (<italic>P</italic> = .09) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546513480613">Table 3</xref>). There was no difference in the distribution by income, race, or employment between the healthy controls and those with a history of shoulder symptoms or treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study establishes age and sex norms for the shoulder activity score in patients with no history of shoulder symptoms and no history of treatment for a shoulder condition. Men had a higher shoulder activity level than women, and shoulder activity level decreased with age. This information is important because it can be used to compare patients and populations with shoulder disorders to better understand how activity level influences symptoms, response to treatment, and interpretation of outcome measures. Outcome measures assessing patient symptoms and function, such as the Constant score, may be skewed by activity level. Shoulder outcomes in a heterogeneous study population are difficult to interpret without having some way to compare the demands placed on the shoulder by each person. High-demand patients may have different symptoms and functional limitations than low-demand patients, despite a similar shoulder condition. Furthermore, a patient’s level of activity is likely to influence patient expectations of outcome and perception of treatment. For example, activity level has been shown to be a significant predictor for graft failure after an ACL reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480613">5</xref></sup> Patient activity level before treatment can also affect symptoms, return of function after treatment, and reported outcome after treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480613">5</xref></sup> In any study comparing 2 or more groups of patients, the activity level of the patient in the groups should be similar to avoid a biased comparison. A reliable and valid activity scale can be a powerful tool when evaluating outcomes in clinical studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513480613">6</xref></sup> Normative data for the shoulder activity score are essential to allow clinicians to interpret how affected patients are functioning relative to their age- and sex-matched healthy peers.</p>
<p>The shoulder activity score has been validated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480613">1</xref></sup> and can be used in conjunction with other tools to compare patient cohorts and assess activity level as a prognostic factor in patients with shoulder disorders. This scale was developed using established principles: item generation, item reduction, pretesting, and reliability and validity testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480613">3</xref></sup> The shoulder activity level has also been shown to vary by shoulder diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480613">2</xref></sup> The activity level was significantly higher in patients with instability (mean ± standard deviation [SD], 14 ± 5.2; range, 1-20) than in patients with rotator cuff disease (mean ± SD, 10 ± 5.1; range, 0-20) (<italic>P</italic> = .027) or osteoarthritis (mean ± SD, 7 ± 4.7; range, 0-18) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480613">2</xref></sup> Interestingly, the activity level in patients with instability and rotator cuff disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480613">2</xref></sup> was higher than the overall healthy population in the current study (mean ± SD, 8 ± 5; range, 0-20). Broken down by age, patients under 30 years with shoulder disorders (rotator cuff disease, instability, or osteoarthritis) had a higher median activity level of 14 ± 4.0<sup>2</sup> compared with 9 ± 5 in patients without shoulder disorders in the current investigation. Patients with shoulder disorders aged 31 to 50 years had a median activity level of 10 ± 5.2<sup>2</sup> versus 9 ± 5.0 in healthy participants. In the age range of 51 to 70 years, patients with disorders still had a higher activity level than healthy participants (9 ± 4.9 vs 8 ± 5).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480613">2</xref></sup> Only in those over 70 years of age was the median activity level higher in healthy patients (7 ± 4) compared with those with shoulder disorders (6.5 ± 5.5).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480613">2</xref></sup> Although conclusions cannot be drawn from comparisons of populations across different studies, as they may arise because of differences in population sampling between the 2 studies, this does suggest that activity level may actually be higher in patients with shoulder disorders compared with asymptomatic patients. Patients with shoulder pathological lesions may have a high functional demand related to this joint. Alternatively, patients with shoulder lesions may have a different psychological approach and direct higher attention to the shoulder compared with other joints. More investigations are needed to better understand the interaction between shoulder injury and shoulder activity level.</p>
<p>The results of this study provide a standard to evaluate the significance of a treatment within the context of normal age- and sex-adjusted values and can be used to assign a percentile rank to a given participant’s score within his or her age/sex group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546513480613">Table 4</xref>). For example, a 40-year-old man who reports a shoulder activity score of 10 has a percentile ranking of 55% relative to other men between the ages of 31 and 50 years. In contrast, a 71-year-old woman with a score of 10 falls into the percentile of 85% for her age/sex group.</p>
<p>A secondary purpose of this study was to provide additional evidence for the construct validity of the shoulder activity score by looking for trends in the shoulder activity score with varying age and sex. It was expected that increasing age would be directly proportional to decreasing shoulder activity. This trend was observed for both male and female cohorts. It was also expected that men would be more active than women for each age group. This trend was also observed. Men were also more likely to participate in contact and overhead-throwing sports.</p>
<p>The present study does have some limitations. While using a cross-sectional design and utilizing a database matched to the US Census Bureau on geographical region, age, income, and household size, the sample size is relatively small when compared with the US population at large. However, the response rate was high (86%). Participants were also recruited using e-mail. Therefore, participants had to be familiar with the use of a computer and the Internet. This introduces potential selection bias, although it is unlikely that a participant’s familiarity with technology influences his or her shoulder activity level. This may have affected the distribution of the population in terms of income and race; for example, the population over 70 years of age was heavily skewed toward whites. Further investigation into the relationship of race and ethnicity to shoulder activity may be warranted. The data for age were obtained in a categorical, not a continuous, manner, meaning that patients were asked their age group and not their actual age. As a result, details regarding age-specific data are not available for analysis. Ideally, a 31-year-old man would not be grouped with a 50-year-old man. Grouping participants into tighter age ranges or collecting actual ages would have been more optimal. Another limitation is that we did not attempt to establish normative data for the population less than 18 years of age. Finally, this study population is limited to the US and may not be applicable in populations with different cultures, ethnicities, and languages.</p>
<p>In summary, the shoulder activity score is a valid and reliable questionnaire that measures a patient’s shoulder activity over the previous year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480613">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480613">2</xref></sup> The normative data presented in this study enhance the value of this questionnaire by providing age- and sex-adjusted values. Normative data are an important baseline for comparing untreated and treated shoulder cohorts to better understand the variance in shoulder activity level and how it may relate to clinical outcomes.</p>
