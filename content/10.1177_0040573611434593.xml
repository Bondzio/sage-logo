<p>Recent interest in the relationship between sociology and theology has generated significant discussion about the problem of belief in late modernity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573611434593">1</xref></sup> Social psychology in particular has highlighted the challenges of the psychological pressure of pluralism on religion, and its reflexive expression, theology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573611434593">2</xref></sup> What kinds of challenges does this pose for theology? How should theology proceed in light of this situation? These issues are discussed here in light of the positions of two leading scholars, one a sociologist of religion with an interest in theology, Peter L. Berger, the other a theologian (ethicist) with a sociological sensibility, John Howard Yoder.

<sec id="sec1-0040573611434593"><title>Peter Berger and the Social Psychological Problem for Theology</title>
<p>Peter Berger argues that the greatest challenge facing theology in late modernity is the problem of social psychology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573611434593">3</xref></sup> For him the social structural challenges of modernity, rationalization, and differentiation, and their corollaries, pluralism and choice, place theology in a highly relativized context in which theology is in the position of being a “cognitive minority.” That is, religion finds itself in a social context in which there are many other religious options (as well as competing secular/ideological ones) that make a claim on human consciousness. Berger writes, “Thus the institutional pluralization that marks modernity affects not only human actions but also human consciousness: Modern man finds himself confronted not only by multiple options of possible courses of action but also by multiple options of possible ways of thinking about the world.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573611434593">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a result, modern pluralism “creates anxieties and tensions”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573611434593">5</xref></sup> within human consciousness. The reason for this is that individuals require social support for their beliefs, which Berger calls “plausibility structures,” in order to maintain that belief as durable and constant in human consciousness. Modernity pluralizes the cognitive options available for individuals to construct religious identities, and relativizes all plausibility structures. The culture Berger envisions is a “post-traditional” culture in which traditional Christianity has lost its hegemony. At one time, Christian faith was influential and pervasive in culture, enjoying nearly “taken-for-granted” status in the minds of most individuals. However, in late modernity this is no longer the case. All available social options are pluralized, and, thus, “relativized” in the minds of everyday people. Since all religious authorities are equally “de-legitimated,” the individual must turn to his or her own subjectivity to discover some meaningful order by which to live.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573611434593">6</xref></sup> The individual in modern pluralistic society is described as a “nervous Prometheus” rooted out of traditional social contexts that provided strong social support for belief, stranded and alone amidst a plurality of worldviews, faced with the “heretical imperative” to “construct his own deviant position” and left to support that “religious preference” with whatever personal and social resources are available.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573611434593">7</xref></sup> The social psychological pressure of such “cognitive deviance” is so great that individuals (and by extension theology) attempt to lessen the pressure by engaging in certain cognitive strategies.</p>
<p>Berger sees three social options for theology placed in this difficult position: “deductive,” “reductive,” and “inductive.” These he identifies as “ideal types.” The many empirically available theological options only approximate them, but they function heuristically, as tools to understand the range of options. The particularity of religion, and its reflexive expression theology, must negotiate a relationship with the broader pluralistic culture. These general social strategies may also be expressed as theological methods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573611434593">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The “deductive” option attempts to manage the cognitive pressure by reaffirming the tradition. But, it must do so with a sense of nostalgia, a sense of loss. Only in the past, when tradition enjoyed widespread cultural support, was there a measure of certainty and taken-for-grantedness that enabled individuals to live free from doubt. There was a closer correspondence between the objective social structural support and the subjective consciousness of the believer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573611434593">9</xref></sup> Under conditions of modernity, tradition no longer holds such powerful cultural influence. Theology must now argue for tradition in the face of plurality. It must do so realizing that tradition is one “choice” among others. Berger cites Neo-orthodoxy as an example of this type. He writes, “Neo-orthodoxy is the reaffirmation of the objective authority of a religious tradition after a period during which that authority had been relativized and weakened.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573611434593">10</xref></sup> For those who take this option this can, however, be a potentially powerful choice. The cognitive benefit of such an affirmation, after a period of doubt and compromise, is the attaining of certainty once again! The cognitive authority of tradition is restored and Christian belief may be “deduced” out of it with the utmost assurance that it is “the Word of God.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573611434593">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Berger sees two basic approaches toward pluralistic culture taken by the deductive strategy: defensive and offensive. Defensive approaches attempt to withdraw into a protective fortress “within which all the old norms, doctrinal as well as behavioral, can be maintained.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573611434593">12</xref></sup> Offensive approaches attempt to “reconquer society.” This counter-modernization strategy often takes the form of a “crusade” to recapture culture for the sake of the gospel.</p>
<p>Central to the deductive strategy is the retrieval of the role of the “community” (Church) as a buttress against the invading claims of the outside world. Clustering together to mutually affirm the tradition, and to protect a fragile religious identity, is characteristic of “sectarian” modes of ecclesiology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573611434593">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The deductive strategy often sees “individualism” as the primary social problem. Individualism is believed to be corrosive of Christian community (and traditional faith and belief) and, thus, is to be confronted sociologically and theologically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573611434593">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Modern pluralism, for Berger, is a powerful cognitive force. The deductive strategy denies the cognitive challenges of the modern situation through a herculean act of the will affirming the tradition with renewed vigor and intentionality. It is a decision to make a “leap of faith.” Yet, this “decisionism” is precisely the fault Berger finds in the deductive method.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573611434593">15</xref></sup> Given that modernity offers sufficient social conditions for cognitive dissonance (angst), why should individuals make the decision to embrace any particular tradition? This is difficult given the multiple options empirically available. Affirmation of any one particular theological tradition implies the negation of many others. As we shall see, this is exactly the issue the “inductive” approach takes seriously.</p>
<p>Another strategy is the “reductive” option, which attempts to “modernize” the tradition. This approach takes the cognitive dominance of the contemporary culture and its claims as “normative.” To the contemporary mind, “the tradition is no longer affirmable except by way of a comprehensive translation into the categories of modern consciousness.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573611434593">16</xref></sup> Theology sees its social “reference group” as the “cultural elite” who make decisions about cognitive claims and before whom theology must appeal for plausibility. In the face of such pressure theology begins to “bargain away” aspects of belief in order to lessen the cognitive pressure of its deviance. Thus, theological notions that are not supported by the broader culture, that is — culture does not act as a “plausibility structure” for these beliefs — are rejected. The primary theological task is seen as “translation” of the strange world of Bible or religion into language the contemporary individual may understand. The result, according to Berger, however, is the desiccation of traditional Christian claims. The primary victim is supernaturalism, “myths” or narratives that depict divine acts in human existence. The “non-mythological” form the gospel takes in translation is “existentialism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573611434593">17</xref></sup> De-mythologization of the “kerygma” is the primary methodology. Ultimately, thinks Berger, theology bargains away transcendence to the point that theology is reduced to anthropology (Feuerbach).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573611434593">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Berger finds serious flaws with both of these strategies. Both are irremediable. However, he sees a mediating position between these two options, which he calls the “inductive.” The best example of this mediation is “liberal Protestantism,” a theological option typified by Friedrich Schleiermacher and espoused by many others after him. The inductive approach avoids the extremes of the other two, but it has an advantage against the cognitive pressures of pluralization in that it appeals to common human experience of the divine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573611434593">19</xref></sup> This, for Berger, is its redeeming quality. It is only this quality that opens the possibility of “passing from this situation [pluralism] to positive religious affirmation, to statements about the world that can plausibly be prefaced by the words ‘I believe’.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573611434593">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Why does Berger think the inductive option, expressed in the liberal Protestant method, is the best option in pluralized America? Part of the answer rests in his understanding of and appreciation for the kind of self that is produced in pluralized late modernity with its emphasis on individualism, freedom, and the concomitant necessity of choice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573611434593">21</xref></sup> For Berger, late modernity looses the individual from traditional moorings, and, like Sartre, sees the individual as “condemned to be free.” This freedom is to be appreciated and celebrated. Yet, it does raise the issue of what measure of certainty a person can attain in such a precarious situation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573611434593">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another part of the answer lies in the very nature of religious experience. A theological approach that rests on common human experience will have a substantial advantage against the relativizations of pluralization. The believer, buffeted by the social structural pluralism of modernity with its many dizzying options, may fall back on what she knows best, her own experience of the divine. This “foundation” is a bulwark against radical groups calling for the self to return to the (false) security (and obscurity) of community (the church), and also against the nihilistic culture that is skeptical of all claims to transcendence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040573611434593">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Berger’s argument in favor of the inductive strategy rests on a crucial interpretation of religious experience. Drawing on resources of the phenomenological tradition,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0040573611434593">24</xref></sup> Berger sets religious experience in a broader context of human experience. Within human experience are occasions of experience of the supernatural and experience of the sacred. The supernatural is portrayed as a province that impinges on the ordinary world of human experience and breaks in. He writes, “the supernatural looms over, ‘haunts,’ even envelopes the ordinary world.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0040573611434593">25</xref></sup> This supernatural realm becomes accessible to this world. Berger describes this “impinging reality” as an experience of the supernatural that
<disp-quote>
<p>Opens up the vista of a cohesive and comprehensive world. This other world is perceived as having been there all along, though it was not previously perceived, and it forces itself upon consciousness as an undeniable reality, as a force bidding one to enter it. The world of the supernatural is perceived as being “out there,” as having an irresistible reality that is independent of one’s own will, and it is this massively objective character that contests the old reality status of the ordinary world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0040573611434593">26</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This view of the supernatural is not coextensive with the phenomenon of religion, however. While confrontations with the supernatural are, indeed, explicitly religious, Berger distinguishes this religious experience of the supernatural from experiences of the sacred, which he believes are experiences of the supernatural “in a definitely nonreligious attitude.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0040573611434593">27</xref></sup> It is the experience of the supernatural in the religious mode that Berger has in mind. Religious experience of the supernatural lies behind and beneath the social, institutional expressions and the legitimations of religious traditions. For Berger, then, the task is to discover the “intuitions” of the supernatural within religious experience that signals the transcendent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0040573611434593">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Experiences of the divine, however, are susceptible to the same vicissitudes as that of all human experience. Following Ernst Troeltsch, Berger recognizes that human experience, as historical and sociological analysts reveal, is relative and transient. This, of course, makes any absolute claims to religious experience and authority impossible. What measure of certainty, then, is possible in a sea of relativity, and how does this relate to the inductive method’s reliance on religious experience as the ground for theological reflection? Berger offers a hint: “In principle, the quest for religious certainty is bound to be frustrated ‘in this world,’ except for <italic>momentary experiences that can only be maintained precariously in recollection.</italic>”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0040573611434593">29</xref></sup> Berger puts this in phenomenological language:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are indeed experiences of contact with the supernatural that carry with them absolute certainty, but this certainty is located only within the enclave of religious experience itself. As soon as the individual returns from this enclave into the world of ordinary everyday reality, this certainty is retained only as a memory and as such is intrinsically fragile.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0040573611434593">30</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is the nature of religious experience itself that is the problem. Even those who have very powerful experiences of the divine face the practical problem of maintaining the immediacy of the experience after returning to mundane reality. Thus, faith is still required of all, even of those who enjoy such intense religious experiences. It is this confidence in an “other” reality that impinges on, and, from time to time, “breaks in” to this reality that Berger believes can be trusted. Underlying the diversity of historical human phenomena called religion is a fundamental divine reality that is “true” and makes itself known and configures, transforms, and reconfigures human experience and consciousness.</p>
<p>Tradition captures these transient, but very powerful religious experiences, and points to them in the accoutrements of ritual and liturgy, but, according to Berger, it also obscures the primary experience under historical and institutional accretions. It is not tradition, but, rather, the experience underlying the tradition that is to be retrieved. For Berger, then, the inductive option is the best approach against the challenges of late modernity:
<disp-quote>
<p>Against the right [neo-orthodox reconstructions], this position means a reassertion of the human as the only possible starting point for theological reflection and a rejection of any external authority (be it scriptural, ecclesiastical, or traditional) that would impose itself on such reflection. Against the left [those that capitulate to modernity], the position means a reassertion of the supernatural and sacred character of religious experience, and a rejection of the particularly oppressive authority of modern secular consciousness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0040573611434593">31</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The inductive approach is an answer to the social psychological pressures of pluralistic late modernity only if religious experience functions in the way Berger expects that it does. For him, the contemporary turn to experience is entirely understandable and fortuitous. However, recently, this liberal Protestant approach to religion and its interest in establishing a foundation for theology based on religious experience has come under fire. Foundationalism may be understood as the attempt to ground religion, and its reflexive expression, theology, on a solid “universal” foundation. For liberal Protestantism, that foundation is construed as universal, common experience of divine presence breaking into this existence. For fundamentalists it is an “inerrant” biblical text that offers the sure foundation for theologizing. Yet, what happens if we posit no such foundation?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0040573611434593">32</xref></sup> What approach to theology is possible if there is only particularity? Is theology still possible? The fundamental position of this article is to answer this question in the affirmative. The way forward, however, will require a way of understanding the gospel and church against the background of the social psychological challenges of pluralistic late modernity.</p>
<p>Let it be said, however, that there is strong prima facie plausibility for the inductive option.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0040573611434593">33</xref></sup> First, it preserves what most people, whose identities are formed in a pluralistic late modernity, value in contemporary society—individualism and freedom. Second, its emphasis on transcendence, reinforced by classic views of supernatural religion (the phenomenological tradition), has a long historical support. Third, one’s own immediate experience of divine reality as “truth” is a powerful advantage against relativism and pluralism. Liberal Protestant foundationalism, according to Berger, allows the individual to achieve a measure of comfort and confidence in his or her religious affirmations, without, however, being assured of absolute certainty. Berger affirms a “mellowness,” a calm trust that “the authentic and true forces of reality will reassert themselves even in a wider context” of modern and religious pluralism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0040573611434593">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>What can be said of Berger’s approach other than the critique of foundationalism? I suggest three. First, Berger’s view of the role of the gospel (and its relation to Jesus Christ) in theological methodology is ambiguous. Berger’s theological approach tends to be more theistic than christological.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0040573611434593">35</xref></sup> This is largely true because Berger writes with the problem of religious pluralism in mind. The gospel and its witness to Christ points to the God “who disclosed Himself in the events recounted by the Jewish and Christian Scriptures.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0040573611434593">36</xref></sup> What is the role of Jesus Christ for Berger? He recognizes that, for Christians (the early Christians) supreme focus has been placed on “this one figure of Jesus, in whose life, death, and resurrection…the redeeming love of God has been revealed once and for all.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0040573611434593">37</xref></sup> In fact, Christians have affirmed that there is no other name by which this revelation comes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0040573611434593">38</xref></sup> Berger offers a rather severe critique of this early Christian exclusivism, however, arguing that early Christians overstated the importance of Jesus in salvation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0040573611434593">39</xref></sup> In fact, he sees evidence that early Christians attempted to overcome the particularity of Jesus’ life. He writes, “What is more, Christian thought ever since those early days has tried to grapple with a perception of Christ’s action in the world that transcends the brief lifespan of Jesus of Nazareth.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0040573611434593">40</xref></sup> This is evident in the <italic>logos</italic> Christology of John, the development of the idea of Trinity, and in the christological cosmologies of the Church Fathers. Thus, for Berger, Christians must identify the experience of God’s redeeming love with the person of Jesus, but it also must be understood to transcend him. And yet, Berger still desires to affirm some special place for Jesus in Christian faith. Of this Berger writes, “If God was in Christ, then He must be wherever redeeming power is transforming reality. This cosmic Christ, savior of this and all possible worlds…is everywhere, eternally.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0040573611434593">41</xref></sup> Berger places great emphasis on this Johannine <italic>logos</italic> Christology: “In other words, there are no limits to the <italic>logos</italic>, the Christ, in either time or space: He is present in all reality.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0040573611434593">42</xref></sup> The primary significance of Jesus of Nazareth is that his life points to the God of redeeming love. It is revelatory of God’s desire to save the world. The result in Berger’s christology is that one’s attention is deflected from Jesus’ life and teaching, to his universal, cosmic significance, with the concomitant loss of his distinctive, and particular, ethic.</p>
<p>Second, the church plays only a marginal role in Berger’s inductive option. This is probably because he associates the church too closely with tradition to see a very significant role for it. Berger’s ecclesiology has been characterized as having aspects of <italic>kerygma</italic> and <italic>didache</italic>, but no <italic>koinonia</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0040573611434593">43</xref></sup> Berger does take seriously the problem of “ecclesial belonging,” however.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0040573611434593">44</xref></sup> He knows what is at stake. He must affirm the need for Christian community because of the social psychological need for social support of belief. Religious institutions are required as social support of the belief in a certain religious experience of God. In a play on the early Catholic affirmation that “there is no salvation outside the church,” Berger states that there is no “plausibility without the appropriate plausibility structure.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0040573611434593">45</xref></sup> Community social support is necessary because individuals find it extremely difficult, in a pluralistic environment, to maintain in consciousness certain religious beliefs. The church “is the place where Christians huddle together and assure each other that they are right, while all the others—Greeks, Jews, Muslims, or agnostics—are in error.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0040573611434593">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, he suggests that “the relation between religious experience and religious institutions is ambiguous.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0040573611434593">47</xref></sup> Why is this the case? It is because, in his mind, religious institutions point to an experience of God but also domesticate it? This ambivalence is most evident in American denominationalism. Religious institutions like denominations function to “routinize” the sacred so as to enable individuals to integrate religious experience “into the habits and mindset of ordinary, everyday living.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0040573611434593">48</xref></sup> This both keeps a particular experience alive and also enables individuals to go on with ordinary life.</p>
<p>The real issue for Berger, however, is religious and theological. What is one to believe and what happens when one’s beliefs are not carried by any ecclesial tradition? On the one hand, what denomination is one to adhere to if one wants to avoid the reductionism of secularization, and yet, is unable to accept the strictures of conservative Christianity?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0040573611434593">49</xref></sup> Sociologically, this is a difficult position, but it is a more difficult theological position. Berger identifies three possibilities: mainline (Episcopalian and Lutheran), Evangelicalism, and Catholicism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0040573611434593">50</xref></sup> All three are problematic for him. Mainline churches have largely given in to secular culture (bargaining away too much of supernaturalism). Evangelicalism, he notes, is “a world-wide movement of immense success, indeed the most successful movement of a religious nature today.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0040573611434593">51</xref></sup> While adhering to such a religious community may result in the good feeling of being a “part of a vigorously religious, unambiguously Christian community,” unfortunately, Evangelicalism poses too many intellectual obstacles. For example, it requires, he says, the affirmation of “a long list of hard-to-swallow propositions, from the nature of the biblical texts to the details of the life of Jesus.” This is not even to mention a distinctive, but unacceptable, religious life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0040573611434593">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>What about Catholicism? Does it fare any better in his assessment? Not in the least. Despite its ancient heritage, “the required sacrifices of the intellect are considerable.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0040573611434593">53</xref></sup> Berger challenges the historical and empirical assumptions of Catholic assertions of divine sanction and claims to authority. To accept Roman Catholicism, and its claims to authority, “requires an enormous act of counter-empirical faith about the intentions and actions of Jesus with regard to the future of his movement, the role of Peter and the early bishops of Rome, and most importantly, God’s way of acting in human reality.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0040573611434593">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>While one may agree with Berger on certain aspects of religious possibilities in late modernity, one may disagree with him on the role of <italic>ecclesia</italic> in contemporary religious life. For Berger, the church exists as a social structure, which functions to inculcate and maintain certain beliefs in human consciousness. This cognitive emphasis is strong in Berger’s corpus. The role of the Church as social context in which Christian habitus is formed plays little role in his ecclesiology.</p>
<p>Third, and more positively, Berger recognizes the unique place individual freedom and choice play in contemporary pluralistic contexts. He obviously favors the liberation of modernity. I argue that John Howard Yoder’s theological approach to the social psychological pressures of pluralism overcomes the weaknesses of the inductive approach but preserves individual personal freedom without promoting an individualism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0040573611434593">55</xref></sup></p>

<p>What happens when one rejects Berger’s mediating option of induction?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0040573611434593">56</xref></sup> What theological options are possible if one agrees with Berger that the deductive and the reductive options are to be avoided, but disagrees with him over the theological and methodological possibility of grounding belief on a foundation of “common human experience?” Is it still possible to do theology in light of Berger’s claim for social psychology, and after the rejection of foundationalism?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0040573611434593">57</xref></sup> One such possibility may be found in the thought of John Howard Yoder.</p>
<p>For Berger, the social psychological dynamic lies in the person’s emerging out of a particular social location to face a broader pluralistic world. Facing the radical pluralism of modern society, the individual attempts to reduce psychic pressure by one of three strategies: a return to the tradition, a giving up of local identity, or an attempt to find common ground. For Berger, only a “universal” is able to alleviate the psychic pressure, and, fortunately, he thinks, one is available, and liberal Protestantism has identified it.</p>
<p>Yoder’s analysis focuses on the social psychological problem in a different way by asking the question of validation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0040573611434593">58</xref></sup> He, too, analyzes the social psychological process of an individual emerging from her particular social contexts to encounter the broader world. The encounter with a world that claims its truths are self-evident instigates a great deal of psychic pressure for one’s own personal beliefs. While this is not a new situation for theology, modernity does radicalize the possibilities. This individual under such psychic pressure aches for relief and finds it in the search for foundations. The search for foundations, Yoder explains, is “the urge to find some argument, some mental move, some court of appeal beyond appeal,” and, is a “learned personal psychic defense against the constantly repeated experience of being overpowered by a wider world.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0040573611434593">59</xref></sup> This is a natural psychological response, but in the end is “logically unrealistic.” Underlying this is a “fear of vulnerability, a cringing before the danger that we may be told by an audience in that wider world that they do not believe us.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0040573611434593">60</xref></sup> Ultimately, the primary motivation toward universality is the psychological need to be believed, for our own ideas to be validated by others. The primary motivation for validation is “a hunger for power.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0040573611434593">61</xref></sup> Fear of not being accepted is translated into a desire to manipulate and leverage others to our perspective, to force others to accept our positions either by leveraging civil power or by means of intellectual argument.</p>
<p>What approach to validation (universality) does Yoder take? What theological strategy does he offer that constitutes an alternative? There are three aspects to his strategy: a critique of monolithic culture; trust in the nature of evangel; and the public role of <italic>ecclesia</italic> as witness.</p>
<p>Before elaborating on each of these, however, we must set the context for the discussion of ethical vision and pluralism. Yoder takes as his point of departure the dialogue with James Gustafson regarding the possibility of universality in ethics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0040573611434593">62</xref></sup> Gustafson rejects particularity in favor of universality. Yoder rejects the move toward universality in favor of particularity. This is not, however, the emphasis on particularity of Neo-orthodoxy, but, rather, a unique alternative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0040573611434593">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>For Gustafson, says Yoder, theological knowledge is a “null-sum” game in which it is an all or nothing proposition. Either one opts for authenticity, the preservation of one’s parochial identity and particularity, or one gives it up in favor of attaining intelligibility to the broader society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0040573611434593">64</xref></sup> For Gustafson, any acceptance of particularity necessarily implies an acceptance of obscurantism. The primary principle for Yoder, in opposition to Gustafson and the psychic need to validate one’s own position, is that there is no non-particular place to stand.</p>
<p>Yoder rejects the polar position of either/or, either authenticity or intelligibility. Instead, he argues that they actually are mutually conditioning. He writes, “I suggest that the standard polar account is not merely caricatured, and exaggerated, but illogical. In ordinary rationality, intelligibility and authenticity condition each other mutually.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0040573611434593">65</xref></sup> Yoder attempts to show that they condition each other by presenting an option not usually listed in the taxonomy of ethical alternatives. He points to the nature of the evangel, or gospel, as an option, which he calls evangelical, that is able to accomplish “transtribal validation.” This is, in fact, the goal of the gospel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0040573611434593">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>How is his evangelical strategy a means of managing the psychic stress of plurality? Yoder responds to Gustafson by critiquing three basic assumptions about the world, the gospel, and the church. Thus, for Yoder, we need a better insight into the nature of the outside world (culture), a better understanding of the evangel, and a better understanding of the church.</p>
<p>First, Gustafson assumes that the world into which the gospel must be communicated has universal and common characteristics. Here, Yoder rejects any appeal to a “wider world” out there that is in any way monolithic. There is no modern secular culture of which to speak. There is only a world of particularities!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0040573611434593">67</xref></sup> Certainly, there may be overlaps, but for such thinkers like Gustafson, the assumption that culture or the social is uniform and monolithic is simply incorrect. There is only the concrete encounter of one particularity with another. It is in this context that the gospel is announced. There can be no “redefinition, dilution, distillation, or translation, made outside the concrete encounter between message-bearers and receptors.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0040573611434593">68</xref></sup> Interestingly enough, Yoder’s position actually intensifies the psychic pressure rather than lessening it.</p>
<p>Second, Gustafson assumes that the gospel is unable to be communicated across particularities. Yoder responds by calling us to a fundamental trust in the nature of the evangel. He trusts the ability of the gospel to transcend particularity, but not by means of rational assent. He writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>We need therefore to reconstruct the nature of particularity as a truth challenge. We must abandon the chimerical vision of a set of semantic or definitional moves which would transcend the limits of ones’ own identity, rationally coercing assent, without taking account of a particular interlocutor or a specific dialogical setting. We must relinquish the dream of a set of social moves which would find or construct a “world” so big as to enclose everyone else.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0040573611434593">69</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Yoder, the notion of a broader world of secularity is a construct, a fiction, which was the product of an imagination scandalized by difference (plurality). The psyche, fearful of difference, succumbed to the temptation to invent a world in which no one needed to be different. It did so by means of rationality.</p>
<p>The anti-intuitive strategy of Yoder is to understand that the gospel’s ability to speak transtribally is a function of its particularity. If this is the case, then we must find “a better way to restate the meaning of a truth claim from within particular identity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0040573611434593">70</xref></sup> The early Christian announcement of evangel as good news is the way it accomplished this. “News” refers to that which is “contingent and historical.” It is parochial. But, news is also communicable! It’s public act is to announce good news. This, contrary to Gustafson, is not merely sectarianism, fideism, or confessionalism. Rather, it is possible to communicate this good news in the language of any addressee. For Yoder, the history of the gospel makes invalid the notion that particularity is incapable of transtribal communication. History corrects misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Why and how can the gospel be communicated transtribally across tribal lines? The coming of the evangel is a <italic>kenosis</italic>. The answer lies in the nature, and example, of the Incarnation. The Logos did not lose identity in the act of communication. Evangel, says Yoder, “has to submit—wants to submit—vulnerably to the conditions of meaning of the receptor culture.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0040573611434593">71</xref></sup> There is no “public and shared criteria” that is shared by every culture. Ironically, if there were, the gospel would not be needed. Rather, the “‘reasons which count’ are present in the intrasubjective communication setting, by virtue of the fact that the newsbearers have entered the scene, submitting to the language of the host culture, articulating and incarnating their values in the neighbors’ terms.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0040573611434593">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>How is the particular one to enter the wide world of radical particularity in order to engage it? In the same way the gospel came: not in a triumphalist way. There is no way to “impose consent.” Some constructive theologians, in the vein of foundationalism, attempt to coerce others to accept their claims. Yoder says of them, “their definitional moves still project the assumption that they want to be able to restate the claims for belief that every <italic>reasonable</italic> reader will have no choice but to agree.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0040573611434593">73</xref></sup> Thus, civil coercion is replaced in favor of intellectual coercion. One way accepts the psychic pressure and trusts in the nature of the evangel to convince. The other, in fear, attempts to manage and force consent. The desire to force the “other” to accept us is a response to the social psychological pressure of radical plurality. Yet, the gospel calls us to bear the psychic pressure, and to trust the Lord of history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0040573611434593">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>Third, Gustafson assumes the church is not peculiarly, and necessarily, linked to the gospel. An emphasis on the essential relationship between community and gospel is, for Gustafson, sectarianism. Gustafson rejects the church in favor of the world. Yoder, responding to this assumption, argues that a message is born by a community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0040573611434593">75</xref></sup> To believe the witness and receive the message implies the joining of the community which bears it. Thus, when one hears the message of the gospel, witnessed to by those who have been commissioned to announce it, one is called to participate in the community as “God’s children.” Yoder elaborates:
<disp-quote>
<p>Without leaving their own world, the addressees enter the community of the witnesses who first had crossed the border in the other direction. Each world expands to encompass part of the other. The empowerment for this new community comes neither from those receivers having fled their own world nor from the witnesses having annexed it. Nor is it derived from the witnesses having obtained correct information about how to modify their message in order to approach the receptor world. What [believers] have received is not an epistle, nor a line of argument. It is the simple historical presence of <italic>Logos</italic> himself enfleshed in their (our) midst, so that they could let their story be incorporated in his.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0040573611434593">76</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here Yoder ties together inextricably the church and the gospel. The church is not first a bearer of an argument. It is, rather, essentially a witness to “the Logos that has become particular (<italic>sarx</italic>) in Jesus,” who is “the light that illumines everyone.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0040573611434593">77</xref></sup> And that witness is the community of the people of God.</p>
<p>In conclusion, then, both Berger and Yoder take seriously the social psychology of pluralism. Berger’s strategy, on the one hand, is to lessen the impact of psychic pressure by appealing to one’s own experience of the divine, which is common to all humanity. It is for Berger a universal. Yoder, on the other hand, rather than seeing particularity and pluralism as problems to be overcome, sees them as simply part of the historical picture. The psychic pressure is certainly greater today than under Christendom, but the impulse is the same: how to deal with the dissonance radical plurality instigates. Yoder demonstrates a fundamental trust in the “phenomenon of evangel,” and the ecclesia as a witness to that gospel. The church is not simply a place where those of like-minded beliefs huddle together for social support against the social psychological onslaught of pluralism, but, rather, a sociological community with its own practices enabling it to bear witness to the world of the “good news” that Jesus is Lord.</p>

<fn id="fn62-0040573611434593"><label>62</label><p>Yoder focuses on Gustafson’s work because he represents so well the mainstream assumptions of the need for universality in Christian ethics.

<fn id="fn63-0040573611434593"><label>63</label><p>Both Berger and Yoder reject the option of reductionism which caves into modernity and bargains away all particularity. Ironically, for Yoder, this is actually a turn from one particularity to another.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn64-0040573611434593"><label>64</label><p>Gustafson sounds terribly close to Berger’s reductive strategy that accepts the plausibility structures of modernity as valid criteria for acceptability and intelligibility.</p></fn>
