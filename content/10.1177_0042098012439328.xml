<p>In his monograph, <italic>Houses in Motion: The Experience of Place and the Problem of Belief in Urban Malaysia</italic>, author Richard Baxstrom offers an ethnographically rich exploration of recent geo-political shifts taking place in Brickfields, a historically significant neighbourhood in Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur. Baxstrom’s research is informed by extensive fieldwork, conducted over the course of 14 months from 2000 to 2002 and includes a wide range of interviews with neighbourhood residents and myriad Malaysian actors involved in the construction of local mega projects.</p>
<p>Part I of the book is segmented into apposite time frames, offering the reader a well-written historical overview of Brickfields (albeit with some minor chronological errors) that lays the groundwork for subsequent analyses of contemporary conflicts and negotiations over the right to space in the neighbourhood. Throughout this discussion, Baxstrom highlights the multitude of laws and informal actions employed by both domestic and foreign actors in an effort to produce an orderly, ‘modern’ and bounded Brickfields community—one that continues to be politically and rhetorically constructed as ‘Indian’ despite its ethno-religious diversity.</p>
<p>In part II, Baxstrom capitalises on his thick, situated research of everyday life to examine how residents struggle to establish a ‘right to the city’. Drawing primarily on the work of Gilles Deleuze and, to a lesser extent, Henri Lefebvre, he considers the ways in which these citizens think about, imagine and believe in an alternate future for their neighbourhood and their role in it. Specifically, he explores the ways in which residents negotiate the uncertainty of their relationships with the authorities and with each other in the midst of two massive ‘modernising’ transformations—the construction of the KL Sentral train station and KL Monorail transport network. These case studies illustrate well how such monumental upheavals in local, lived realities impact the ability of citizens to believe in different lives for themselves and for their community. In his analysis of these political negotiation processes, Baxstrom employs Deleuze’s notion of immanent belief to allow for an array of concomitant identities and selves, grounding such belief in citizens’ “nexus of experience” (p. 9) <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> such mega projects. I struggled, however, to understand fully what Baxstrom himself conceives of ‘belief’, particularly in his fifth chapter as the concept seems to get tangled up in an Islamic form of belief and governance.</p>
<p>Woven into Baxstrom’s narrative is an exploration of the very political spaces that exist between the law and how justice operates—often in a very unjust manner—on the ground. As residents were largely excluded from discussions about the future of their own neighbourhood, he offers valuable insight into the alternative methods they developed to gather and disperse information, and their creative techniques for engaging with the authorities rather than evading or ignoring the law. Also of value is Baxstrom’s discussion of the complex ways in which Hindu residents have effectively exhorted the authorities not only to recognise but actually to support religious differences within a state-sanctioned approach to balancing modernity and Islam. Nevertheless, I would have welcomed a discussion of how other groups in Brickfields negotiated similar terrain. This discussion would also benefit from the stores of academic literature addressing the pervasive culture of fear in the country and the counter-hegemonic activities undertaken by Malaysians writ large. While no piece of work can be everything to everyone, sections of the monograph would be likewise strengthened from additional scholarly literature concerning land rights more generally and issues related to broader ‘modernisation’ projects and the quest for ‘progress’ in Malaysia. Indeed, the author would have done well to embed the case of Brickfields within a more comprehensive local, national and regional context, especially given his contention that we gain a more thorough understanding of Malaysian politics by combining macro- and local-level analyses.</p>
<p>Particularly interesting in this monograph are Baxstrom’s in-depth vignettes of specific interviewees and groups (for example, the blind) struggling to find their place within a space in flux. These ethnographic segments give a grounded depth to his work, underscoring the fluidity of Malaysian identity, rather than trying to fit individuals into neat categories of affinity. His description of how local residents make use of the ‘Counterfeiter’ and the ‘Gangster’ archetypes to help construct their personal identities and sense of belonging—as their homes, quite literally, shifted under their feet—is persuasive. I am, however, less convinced by the ‘Stranger’ archetype, which is watered down in its oversimplification of such a broad and generic stereotype.</p>
<p>As well, although the academic publishing world is not usually known for its speedy production schedule, the gap between the author’s fieldwork (2000–02) and the book’s publication date (2008) is notable. Given this time lapse, I would have very much welcomed an epilogue highlighting some of the key changes that have taken place in and around Brickfields post-construction of the mega projects and the associated implications for neighbouring residents. While Baxstrom’s comprehensive set of notes reveals the depth of his research, a more robust conclusion would have also helped to bring together various threads in the monograph, while a few well-placed maps would aid the reader in understanding the geo-political shifts he describes.</p>
<p>Although this book may appear to focus on a relatively narrow slice of Malaysia’s geographical pie, it is well-written, based on extensive and thoughtful fieldwork, and speaks to broader issues related to human rights, urban anthropology and Malaysian studies.</p>
