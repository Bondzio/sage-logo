<p>Some have suggested that Job's ‘curse’ in ch. 3, beginning ‘Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth’ (3.1), is intended to prod God into allowing him to die (cf. 2.9) or perhaps to gain him an audience with God so that he can vindicate himself. However, the key to interpreting ch. 3 lies in understanding the womb imagery which is present in all three strophes. This article explores possible thematic and literary parallels between Job's opening speech in 3.1–10 and Akkadian birth incantations, and suggests that the opening speech is a satirical reversal of a birth incantation designed to undo his birth rather than to assist a birth.</p>

<p>Some have suggested that Job's ‘curse’ in ch. 3, beginning ‘Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth’ (3.1), is intended to prod God into allowing him to die (cf. 2.9) or perhaps to gain him an audience with God so that he can vindicate himself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089212438007">1</xref></sup> The present study suggests that Job's opening speech in 3.1–10 is a satirical reversal of a birth incantation designed to undo his birth rather than to assist a birth. Edward Greenstein commented extensively in a 2008 SBL paper about the use of Akkadian in Job and described the Akkadian words as being used purposefully as a poetic literary device. He suggested that the imagery of a door bolt in Job 38.8–10 ‘recalls Akkadian incantations against trouble in childbirth’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089212438007">2</xref></sup> Drawing heavily on Greenstein's suggestions that the author used Akkadian phrases intentionally, I suggest that in ch. 3 Job is trying to regain control of his life through the use of a magical incantation directed at the womb. Rather than offering a form-critical analysis, which would in fact be impossible due to the scarcity of texts available and to the fact that no Akkadian scholar has identified standard forms in birth incantations, I explore possible thematic and literary parallels between Job 3.1–10 and Akkadian birth incantations.</p>
<p>The sages used metaphor to teach and understand theological anthropology. In Job, however, theological anthropology takes a dramatic twist. Rather than the metaphors establishing God as creator, Job uses the theme of creation to chant a ‘counter-cosmic incantation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089212438007">3</xref></sup> Leo Perdue proposes that ch. 3 is a curse to destroy all of creation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089212438007">4</xref></sup> However, in 3.10, Job literally questions why he was not kept in the womb, and why his mother's womb was not locked shut. The image of the doors of the womb being locked shut by a bolt appears in Akkadian incantations against trouble in childbirth and, as Greenstein points out, the image also occurs in Job 38: ‘Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb?—when I made the clouds its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling band, and prescribed bounds for it, and set bars and doors’ (38.8–10). In a satirical, perhaps even humorous way, Job seems to be using a birth incantation to undo his birth process.</p>

<title>Job 3: Lament, Curse, or Something More?</title>
<p>An exilic date for the piece, elements of Babylonian birth incantation imagery elsewhere in the book, and Job's own call to magicians to join him (3.8) make a connection between Job's speech and ancient Near Eastern literary convention possible. Identified as a wisdom text, ‘the poetic dialogues of Job represent a collage of literary features, including forms, motifs, and themes that indicate clearly it is an elegant composition of a gifted sapiential poet very familiar not only with the language of the sages but also with other literatures, Jewish and ancient Near Eastern, in particular Babylonian’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089212438007">5</xref></sup> Judging from the number of Akkadian words present in the text, the audience is most likely wealthy and highly educated. ‘The exiles’ knowledge of Akkadian would likely have been necessary, although the uneducated might have relied only on Aramaic, leaving it up to Jewish scribes to master the difficult cuneiform language'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089212438007">6</xref></sup> It is impossible to determine exactly when Job was written, although Perdue places Job anywhere between 586–350 bce,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089212438007">7</xref></sup> making the reference to a Babylonian incantation credible. It seems more than likely that the sages of Judah would have been familiar with such Akkadian literary traditions. Scholars have noted other Akkadian images in Job, including chaos, the magic of pagan priests, the first man, death as final human destination, the questioning of divine justice, the divine council, the righteous sufferer, and redemption by the personal deity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089212438007">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Job 3 is often identified as a lament; however, the text does not follow a traditional biblical lament form. As Claus Westermann observes, ‘the lament [in Job] develops within its own forms and according to its own rules. The lament does not merely join together mournful ideas, whose relationship we can determine based on our own logic…’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089212438007">9</xref></sup> An individual lament form includes an address with an outcry for help and a turning to God, has three subjects (I, God and the enemy), has a confession of trust and a petition to God to act favorably toward the petitioner, includes the assurance of being heard, expresses another wish for God to intervene, and includes a vow of praise and praise of God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089212438007">10</xref></sup> Elements of a lament form present in Job include the ‘why’ questions of 3.11, ‘Why did I not die at birth, come forth from the womb and expire?’, with the question of 3.20, ‘Why is light given to one in misery and life to the bitter in soul?’, and the proclamation of suffering at the end in 3.24–26, ‘For my sighing comes like my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water’. Although some aspects of a lament form are present, noticeably absent from a traditional lament form is a direct address to a divinity. Job also does not complain about an enemy, but perhaps this is because God is the enemy. Perdue calls ch. 3 a ‘lament-like soliloquy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089212438007">11</xref></sup> Perhaps, Carol Newsom says, scholars should not force Job into any one particular genre:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Moreover, texts do not ‘belong’ to genres so much as participate in them, invoke them, gesture to them, play in and out of them, and in so doing continually change them. Texts may participate in more than one genre, just as they may be marked in an exaggerated or in a deliberately subtle fashion. The point is not simply to identify a genre in which a text participates, but to analyze that participation in terms of rhetorical strategies of the text.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089212438007">12</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>But if there is not one particular genre, if ambiguities containing hidden and direct accusations at God are the norm and not the exception, what can be said about the poem? Should the ambiguities be dismissed? The lack of a specific genre should cause us to look closely at the words used along with other structures that may shed light on hidden meanings. In fact, ch. 3 is not a lament. Job is not crying out to God but actively trying to do something about his predicament. Job 3 seems to be a curse with elements of a lament woven throughout.</p>
<p>Several scholars have also noted parallels between Job 3 and the Genesis creation story. Perdue suggests that by eliminating the day of his birth (‘may that day perish’ 3.3), in essence, Job would erase one day; but in erasing that one day, all of creation would be destroyed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089212438007">13</xref></sup> Fishbane's claim of ch. 3 as a counter cosmological incantation points out the magical words present in the text, ‘“sevenfold knots”… to use the language of magic, “loosed, banished, and set free”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089212438007">14</xref></sup> Thus, as Job curses the day of his birth (3.1), he 'binds spell to spell in his articulation of an absolute and unrestrained death wish for himself and the entire creation … Consequently, Job utters his incantation in the throes of his present plight with the intent to banish the <italic>causa materialis</italic> of his condition.'<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089212438007">15</xref></sup> Indeed, this cosmology, as pointed out by Perdue and Fishbane, is not out of place. Akkadian incantations often open with this kind of cosmology to ensure the gods' participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089212438007">16</xref></sup> Such an opening cosmology, followed by the incantation, would certainly have startled the audience. I agree that Job 3.1–10 is an incantation, but rather than destroy creation Job uses his birth incantation in reverse to try to control the creative process, to try to undo his own birth.</p>
<p>In an interesting discussion of the purpose of another Akkadian birth incantation, entitled ‘A Cow of Sin’, Niek Veldhuis states:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The paradox of birth and the contrast of heaven and earth are not unrelated. The first reveals the limits of human capabilities: the limits of his understanding as well as the limits of his ability to control the future. The myth is a way to remove or transgress these limits of understanding. By using magic man is able to influence the future: it transgresses the limits of his power. By using magic man can influence the natural as well as the supernatural powers. The magical treatment is of heavenly origin, as we learn from this poem. Magic is the way to combat everything that threatens human happiness and well-being, it is indeed intended to create a heaven on earth. In other words, magic mediates the contrast heaven-earth, while it solves the paradox of death-life and pain-pleasure by guaranteeing a prosperous birth and thus eliminating the threat.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089212438007">17</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Is Job trying to ‘control the future’, ‘influence the future’ through the use of a reversed magical incantation?</p>

<title>An Incantation in Reverse</title>
<p>Benjamin Foster divides Akkadian literature into four periods: archaic, classical, mature, and late.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089212438007">18</xref></sup> In the mature period, which includes the Creation Epic and the so-called Poem of the Righteous Sufferer, to both of which Job is often compared, it is a common literary technique to be creative and to experiment with language:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The creativity of this period was marked by great experimentation with language. This included use of rare, dialectal, and scholarly words, elaborate and intricate metaphors, refinements of parallelism, and academic Sumerian loanwords … The frequent combination of incantation and prayer is another example of this mature, derivative style.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089212438007">19</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Not only was creativity becoming more frequent, but so also was humor, which opens infinite ranges to an original and satirical thinker. For example, a spoof incantation against a bleating goat uses humor in relation with magical lore according to well-established magical themes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089212438007">20</xref></sup> It may seem to some almost sacrilegious to suggest that Job's incantation is humorous, but there certainly is a comical side to the picture of a man imagining, in considerable detail, the undoing of the whole process by which he was born—shutting the door of his mother's womb, taking away the light that was present as he came forth from the womb. We must either take Job's incantation as real, that he really thought he could undo his birth, or take it as a humorous literary device. No doubt the original readers or audience believed in magic to a greater or lesser degree, and incantations and spells were the norm,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089212438007">21</xref></sup> but it would surely be unthinkable to take seriously a spell directed at all of creation; and surely it is impossible for a grown man to undo his birth no matter what his desire. If the author is using the incantation as a creative humorous device to prove his point, we must ask why. I suggest the author is using Job's incantation to ridicule the idea that humanity, in this case Job, could think he was in control. Job utters the birth incantation to gain control, not to destroy, but his incantation is an impossible spell.</p>
<p>Job's incantation is framed in strikingly possessive language. It begins in v. 1 with ‘his day’ (Heb. <italic>yomo</italic>), not ‘the day of his birth’ as in most English versions, and ends with ‘my womb’ (<italic>bitni</italic>) in 3.10. Elsewhere <italic>yomo</italic> refers to a day of death or destruction (Job 15.32; 18.20; cf. 1 Sam. 26.10; Ps. 37.13) and perhaps it has some of those ominous overtones here. Is the possessive language here intended to indicate Job's desire to gain control over Day, so he can enact his spell? It has been suggested that Night and Day in this passage are personified. Perdue states, ‘The poet may even be drawing on mythological images here in the personification of Day and Night. In a fashion similar to the personification of Dawn and Dusk as deities in Canaanite lore, the poet may be suggesting through metaphor that these two deities are fertility gods who possess the powers of and control over conception (Night) and birth (Day).’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089212438007">22</xref></sup> Perhaps by personifying Day in this verse, Job is naming the evil power in order to gain control over it,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089212438007">23</xref></sup> a regular feature of spells and incantations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089212438007">24</xref></sup> The implication of this, however, not noted elsewhere, is that, by using this personification, by giving Day and Night power over his conception, Job is challenging God's involvement in the process. By cursing Day, Job is not only seeking to regain control over his life, he is challenging God's involvement in the process of his birth. It was believed that conception and birth could not happen without God's involvement. God was as much a part of a baby's conception as the father and mother. Thus, for example, Sarah could not have a baby until God said she could; the same applies with Hannah (Gen. 20.31; 30.22; 1 Sam. 1.5). Elsewhere God shuts the womb (Gen. 20.18). Nor was God's involvement in conception merely a figurative or spiritual matter. As the rabbis put it, there are three beings to whom the child owes his existence: the father, the mother and God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089212438007">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>In v. 4, after cursing the Day of his birth and the Night of his conception, Job asks for a return to darkness: ‘May that day be darkness; let God not seek it from above and do not let light shine upon it.’ In Babylonian birth incantations, the unborn child is described as ‘sitting in darkness’ (<italic>ashib ekleti</italic>), and when born, as seeing ‘the light of the sun’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089212438007">26</xref></sup> In Job's incantation, however, the darkness has added significance. By involving Day and Night in his conception, Job challenges God's involvement in the process. By praying that light will not shine on the day of his birth, he tries to ensure that God will not be able to find the day and even imagines him fumbling in the darkness: ‘Let God not seek it from above’.</p>
<p>Job calls for darkness to claim the day of his birth, but does this mean darkness as in elimination of the day, hence his destruction, or does it imply a return to the darkness of the womb? Akkadian birth incantations use the image of the baby seeing the light of day. Job seems to be calling for a reversal of this process, and vv. 10–19 make it clear that Job does indeed desire a return to the darkness of the womb which he equates with the tomb, thus making it even more probable that we are dealing with a birth incantation. Ironically, in the prologue too, he seems to describe death as ‘returning to the womb’: ‘Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there’ (1.21). Job does not want to see the light; he wants to stay in the darkness, or die at birth (3.16). In 3.5–6, he uses five different Hebrew words for darkness, another feature of Akkadian literature, heightening the intensity of the image. Even darkness itself is personified, gloom and deep darkness claim the Day (v. 5); blackness terrifies him (v. 5); thick darkness seizes him (v. 6). Then 3.7 continues with another personification, the image of barren, joyless Night.</p>
<p>In 3.8, Job is not satisfied with his own incantation; he goes one step further and calls upon magicians to assist him: ‘Let those who curse the day, who are prepared to rouse Leviathan, curse it’. The reference here to professional magicians, skilled in cursing, adds another detail to the present argument that an Akkadian birth incantation underlies the form and imagery of this passage, not least when it is remembered that the word <italic>Chaldean</italic>, originally a synonym for Babylonian (cf. Isa. 47.1, 5), later came to denote ‘astrologer, soothsayer’ (Dan. 2.2, 10).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089212438007">27</xref></sup> Also common to Akkadian incantations is word-play. If the word <italic>yom</italic>, ‘day’, is emended to Yam, the Canaanite sea god, there is a deliberate double entendre and, as Greenstein indicates, then there would be two sea monsters, Leviathan and Yam. Job would be praying that magicians with the necessary skills would conjure up them both to swallow up the day of his birth. Job would then be calling upon the magicians to get Leviathan to swallow the sun and the moon and produce total darkness. In Akkadian incantations, it is necessary to name the gods to enact the magic. If we accept that Day and Night are personified as deities in charge of conception and fertility, then Job has named four deities, Yam, Leviathan, Day, and Night and calls for the experts, the magicians, to complete his spell.</p>
<p>In 3.10, Job once again tries to gain control through the use of the possessive term ‘my womb’: ‘for he did not shut the door of my womb’. Most translations have ‘did not shut the door of my mother's womb’ and, of course, it does refer to the womb of Job's mother. But the text does not say that: it simply says, ‘my womb’. In this context, Job appears to be claiming it as <italic>his</italic> womb. He owns it; it belongs to him, not to the creator or to his mother, but to him. If he had control over it, then he would have the right to curse it and get rid of it and prevent his birth. Akkadian birth incantations pray for the door to be opened, the child to be unbound and given its freedom. The element of unbolting the locked doors is common in Akkadian birth incantations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0309089212438007">28</xref></sup> Ironically, Job wants the doors shut, to remain in the womb where he was in darkness, safe.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Perplexed by what had happened to him despite all his efforts to be ‘blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil’ (1.1; cf. 28.28), Job attempts to regain control by cursing those responsible for his conception and birth in an almost comic incantation based on Babylonian practice. It is humorous to think of Job calling on the experts to undo his birth. Something even a very skilled magician would see immediately as impossible, but Job is desperate for control. The incantation fails, but Job does not give up his attempt at controlling his fate. Incantations are meant to impose some kind of control over the future, over a situation, and Job is continually trying to do that. In ch. 1, he thinks his children might have sinned in their hearts and offers sacrifices for them, perhaps out of piety, but perhaps also out of a concern to ensure, to control his fate by controlling the piety of his children (1.5). At the end of the chapter when Job has lost of his property and his children, rather than turn against God, he tears his clothes and prays, prostrating himself on the ground (1.20–21). He still has control over his own prayer life, but when he is afflicted once more and his body is covered with sores, it seems as if everything is out of control. His wife suggests he ‘curse God and die’ (2.9). To curse God is to ask for certain death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0309089212438007">29</xref></sup> But it is not death Job wants; his curse is about control, control over his life, control over his surroundings, control over his spiritual life.</p>
<p>It is in v. 11 that Job finally comes to a sense of stasis where Job will remain until ch. 38. Webster's <italic>Dictionary</italic> defines stasis as ‘the state of equilibrium or inactivity caused by opposing equal forces’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0309089212438007">30</xref></sup> Here the tomb and the womb are equal. Here it is dark (3.6), Job is quiet, asleep, at rest (3.13), all are equal (3.14), there is no rage and all are at rest (3.17). There is no taskmaster (3.18), there is no slave (3.19), the small and the great are together equal (3.19). In Job's search for peace, we can sense the opposing forces of life and death. Later in the book, in an effort to regain the control he once had, Job protests his innocence (ch. 6) and states that if his case could be heard before a judge (ch. 9), he could prove himself to be sinless. If only God would meet Job in court, then it could be established who is in control, ‘if it is a contest of strength, behold him … there is no umpire between us’ (9.33). In ch. 9, Job complains that God has all the power, and he has none. God can do anything to him and Job can do nothing. Job challenges God, but God refuses the challenge. Job cannot control God. In 10.4, Job accuses God of having made a mistake and later, in the same chapter, accuses God of playing cat and mouse with him (ch. 13). Job's ultimate loss is that of his status. Chapter 29 recalls Job in his glory when he had complete control. As David Clines puts it,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Job portrays himself here as the dominant male, and he behaves like any dominant male among primates: others must make gestures of submission to him. This dominance is what gives him identity and pleasure, and in the time of his loss of it he can only wish that it was restored: ‘Oh, that I were as in the months of old’ (42.2).</p>
<p>Consider a further expression of this patriarchal dominance: ‘Men listened to me, and waited, and kept silence for my counsel. After I spoke they did not speak again, and my word dropped upon them’ (29.21–22). That is to say, once he arrives at the gate all conversation stops, and once he has spoken, the matter is decided. He has total control over his interlocutors as his words ‘drop’ (<italic>nāatap</italic>) upon them (29.22); he prevents discussion and insists on having his own way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0309089212438007">31</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I could go on citing examples of Job's efforts at control and his challenges to God throughout the book. It is not until ch. 38 that God speaks directly to Job and finally addresses Job's desire for control, and in ch. 42 Job finally acknowledges that he is not in control: ‘I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you’ (42.5). No longer is Job telling God what to think, challenging God; he is now listening and repenting. Job finally accepts that he is not the one in control. Of course, it took a whirlwind of heavenly proportions to bring him to that point.</p>
