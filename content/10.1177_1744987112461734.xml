<p>This paper reports the adaptation of an existing internet-based resource (SeeCare) that enables users with chronic illness to self-manage their care. For example, by developing care plans that can be shared with others, such as family, friends and health professionals. The authors set out to develop a similar website for use by cancer patients to support self-management of symptoms and side effects of cancer and its treatment and enable real-time communication between patients and health care professionals (CanCare) if the patient provides them access to their web profiles, care plans and symptom ratings. For example, patients complete symptom scales, which can be accessed by health professionals if the patient wishes. In order to develop the resource, the authors involved patients and health care professionals in the first two phases of the work to determine internet use, desired content and functions of CanCare and then developed a prototype of CanCare informed by these responses. The prototype was then reviewed by a small group of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and health care professionals (<italic>n</italic> = 27). The findings from Phases 1 and 2 were collated in Phase 3 to prioritise which aspects were incorporated into the development of CanCare to become the version to be tested by trial. This final phase was conducted by the research team in consultation with health care and information technology professionals.</p>
<p>With growing numbers of people being diagnosed with cancer and many living for many years beyond their diagnosis, there is a growing need to consider a range of ways in which to support people to self-manage problems they may be facing and support them in managing their care and after care as appropriate. The internet presents a wealth of opportunity to provide information, guidance and contact with others, as well as to support self-management of cancer-related problems, but it is important that such resources are deemed to be reputable, relevant and effective by the people using them. The approach taken to develop this website by involving patients and health care professionals is a good one, although it is not totally clear how decisions were made to incorporate preferences and needs expressed in Phases 1 and 2 into the development of the resource in Phase 3. At no point did the participants have ‘hands-on’ experience of the resource, which is a limitation in the development phase. This is noted as a limitation by the authors. It would have been wise to have a ‘hands-on’ user testing phase before moving to the full trial of this resource to make further refinements. Whether this resource is effective in supporting self-management of cancer/treatment-related problems and communication between health care professionals and patients is yet to be seen and it is not clear what outcomes would be assessed to determine the effectiveness of the resource. That said, the resource has the potential to be of benefit at all stages, from diagnosis through treatment and beyond, to support people affected by cancer in managing their care and recovery by bringing together information about their diagnosis, treatment, clinic appointments, symptoms and so on that can be shared with their health care team and others.</p>
