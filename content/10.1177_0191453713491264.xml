<abstract>
<p>This article is meant as a response to Cristina Lafont’s critiques of Habermas’ view of religion’s role in the public sphere. For Lafont, the burdens that Habermas places on secular citizens, by requiring them to avoid secularism, may entail dangerous consequences for a correct understanding of the concept of deliberative democracy. For this reason, she presents a proposal of her own in which no citizen, whether religious or secular, has the obligation to engage in a way of thinking alien to his or her own cognitive stance. Although subtle and revealing, Lafont’s critiques face two great problems. On the one hand, she does not discuss Habermas’ thoughts on the nature and value of religion, and, on the other, she overestimates sincerity as an element of an ethics of citizenship. I have divided my text in three sections. First, I will present Lafont’s criticism on Habermas’ proposal. For presenting Lafont’s objections I will use and expand an example mentioned by Lafont herself, namely, a political public debate about same-sex marriage. Second, I will answer Lafont’s objections, and finally, I will offer some conclusions regarding the philosophical bases on which Habermas’ account rests.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The recent uprising in Egypt that led to the overthrowing of President Hosni Mubarak has called the world’s attention, once again, to the complex relations between politics and religion. For many optimistic political commentators, this revolt represents a crucial moment for the development of democracy in the Middle East. Other more pessimistic commentators, in contrast, fear that the Egyptian revolution will follow the same path as Iran’s revolution, when radical Islamists ended up taking control over a movement that, at its beginnings, had a broader base.</p>
<p>Any kind of radicalism or dogmatism is contrary to democracy. However, the aforementioned fears seem to presuppose that religious radicalism is especially contrary to it. Be that as it may, even the most positive voices of the first group do not have any other option but to accept that any emergent Egyptian regime will have to be attuned to religion. Ultimately, so it seems, a democracy that excludes religion from Egypt’s public life cannot succeed.</p>
<p>In this context, questions like the following arise. To what extent can one be a religious person and, at the same time, a democratic citizen? Does one’s belonging to a religious community necessarily contradict one’s belonging to a democratic-political community? What happens when a person’s religious obligations seem to contradict her or his duties as a citizen? Broadly speaking, events and questions similar to these shape the milieu in which Jürgen Habermas has developed a normative account of the proper role of religion in the public sphere of a deliberative democracy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0191453713491264">1</xref>
</sup> Some scholars have claimed to be surprised by this ‘Habermasian turn to religion’ and have presented a very powerful and detailed critique of Habermas’ proposal. Cristina Lafont is one of these scholars.</p>
<p>After reading Lafont’s criticisms,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0191453713491264">2</xref>
</sup> one is left with the idea that Habermas’ perspective is derived from, on the one hand, (1) Rawls’ own approach, and, on the other, (2) the strongest critique and objections against Rawls’ proposal as expressed by authors such as Wolterstorff and Weithman. In Lafont’s words: 
<disp-quote>
<p>In his essay ‘Religion in the Public Sphere’, Habermas offers a proposal that aims to give its due to what he considers the correct insight behind each side of the debate: the need to meet the liberal criterion of democratic legitimacy, on the one hand, and the need to secure the political inclusion of religious citizens that democratic legitimacy also requires, on the other. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 131) </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The liberal criterion of democratic legitimacy is represented by Rawls’ conception of the public use of reason for the ethics of citizenship, while the need to secure the political inclusion of religious citizens is represented by the critique against Rawls.</p>
<p>Lafont’s interpretation of Habermas’ role in this debate is not completely groundless since in Habermas’ text titled ‘Religion in the Public Sphere: Cognitive Presuppositions for the “Public Use of Reason” by Religious and Secular Citizens’, he explicitly affirms that his conception ‘<italic>mediates</italic> between the two sides’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2008</xref>: 119; emphasis added).</p>
<p>Hence, according to this ‘mediator interpretation’, Habermas appears to be accepting the liberal view that defends the separation of church and state and, thus, the institutional prevalence of non-religious reasons in political debates. For Lafont, ‘Habermas accepts the Rawlsian proviso regarding political deliberation at the institutional level of parliaments, courts, ministries, and administrations, that is, in what he calls the <italic>formal </italic>public sphere’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 131). This means that, at this level (parliaments, courts, ministries and administrations), no religious argument would be acceptable to justify or express any law, decree, or policy applicable to all citizens. Nevertheless, according to the ‘mediator interpretation’, this is all that Habermas is willing to grant to the liberal side of the conflict. This is why Habermas ‘proposes to eliminate the requirement of providing corroborating non-religious reasons in political deliberations in the <italic>informal </italic>public sphere whenever such reasons are not available’ (ibid.). In this sense, religious citizens who participate in political debates within the context of the informal public sphere should be allowed to offer exclusively religious arguments to support the policies they favor. These citizens are entitled to the valid expectation of having their reasons successfully translated into non-religious reasons.</p>
<p>According to Rawls’ proviso, religious arguments may be introduced in public political discussion at any time, provided that in due course proper political reasons – and not reasons given solely by religious doctrines – are presented that are sufficient to support whatever the religious doctrines are said to support. For Habermas, in contrast, Rawls’ proviso in the informal public sphere represents an unreasonable mental and psychological burden for religious citizens. Hence, he maintains, religious citizens should ‘be allowed to express and justify their convictions in a religious language if they cannot find secular “translations” for them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>Clearly, we are now on the other side of the scale, and, according to Lafont’s ‘mediator interpretation’, Habermas’ proposal is now trying to guarantee the political inclusion of religious citizens. On this side there is an additional ‘coin’ that, for Habermas, would permit the perfect equilibrium on the scale. This ‘coin’ is the idea that secular citizens have to be open-minded enough to collaborate with their fellow religious citizens in finding the adequate secular translations for their religious claims made in the informal public sphere. Secular citizens, in this sense, must be prepared to recognize the potentially translatable truth content of religious reasons.</p>
<p>Lafont summarizes her ‘mediator interpretation’ of Habermas’ proposal as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>This proposal is supposed to yield a more even distribution of cognitive burdens among citizens. On the one hand, religious citizens, like all citizens, must accept the neutrality of the state and thus must accept that only non-religious reasons count for determining coercive policies with which all citizens must comply. On the other hand, secular citizens, like all citizens, must share the burden of translating religious into non-religious reasons. In order to do so, according to Habermas, all citizens have to take religious reasons seriously and cannot deny their possible truth from the outset. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 132)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lafont offers a very powerful critical analysis of Habermas’ account that needs to be taken seriously. This is because, despite her criticism, Lafont shares Habermas’ defense of the ideal of a deliberative democracy, and she acknowledges that ‘the plausibility of this ideal essentially depends on the ability to provide a plausible account of political deliberation in the public sphere under the pluralistic conditions characteristic of liberal democracies in which citizens hold a wide variety of religious and secular outlooks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 128). In this sense, one might say that Lafont’s critique is another case of a family quarrel.</p>
<p>This family quarrel refers to Habermas’ defense of the right of religious citizens to offer religious reasons within the debates which occur in the informal public sphere, against Lafont’s defense of the right of secularistic citizens to maintain their own secularistic stance within the same scenario.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0191453713491264">3</xref>
</sup> In this sense Lafont approves Habermas’ account insofar as it allows religious citizens to offer their most sincere reasons for supporting or rejecting any given position in a public debate within the informal public sphere. However, she argues that the same right should be granted to secularist citizens. For Lafont, ‘if cognitive dishonesty is unacceptable from a normative point of view when it comes to allowing citizens to publicly adopt their own cognitive stance, it seems that this would be so regardless of whether those citizens have a religious or secularist stance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 248). In Lafont’s view religious citizens should be allowed to adopt their own religious stance within public discussions because it is not possible to ‘<italic>choose </italic>a cognitive stance or adopt an instrumental attitude towards it without being cognitively dishonest’ (ibid.). But, for her, this impossibility works in the same way for secularist citizens.</p>
<p>What follows is a response to Cristina Lafont’s critique against Habermas’ view of religion’s role in the public sphere. I think that although powerful and deep, Lafont’s criticisms are mistaken for two reasons. Lafont’s ‘mediator interpretation’ misses a very important aspect of Habermas’ own approach, i.e. his thoughts on the nature and value of religion as related to the idea of public reason and public deliberation. Furthermore, Lafont overemphasizes the value of sincerity and the absence of self-restraint as two elements for developing a proper notion of an ethics of democratic citizenship. These two elements, to be sure, do not have the same weight in Habermas’ own account.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0191453713491264">4</xref>
</sup> In fact, I claim that Lafont’s own proposal, seen in light of these counter-arguments, ultimately collapses into Habermas’ account.</p>
<p>In order to present my claims I have divided my text in three sections. First, I will present Lafont’s criticisms of Habermas’ proposal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0191453713491264">5</xref>
</sup> Second, I will expound a response to Lafont’s objections. Finally, I will offer some conclusions regarding the philosophical bases on which Habermas’ account rests. These conclusions constitute only preliminary reflections that indicate new directions for developing a more thorough and systematic critique of Habermas’ account of the role of religion in the public sphere.</p>

<title>Lafont's criticism illustrated in a case of a democratic political public debate: same-sex marriage</title>
<p>In the introduction I briefly described Lafont’s perspective as a ‘mediator interpretation’. I will come back to this description later. In this section I will develop the 5 more relevant objections to Habermas that one can find in Lafont’s articles. In order to present them I will expand an example mentioned by Lafont herself, namely, a political public debate about same-sex marriage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0191453713491264">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Let us suppose that a fictitious state called the United States of the Deliberative Democracies (USDD) is engaged in a public debate about the possibility of enacting a law allowing same-sex marriages. The USDD is a highly pluralistic society composed of a diverse citizenry with very different world-views and life-projects. However, the majority of them are religious people. Some of them are ‘simply’ religious enough to accept as valuable for their lives the most important guiding precepts of their religion. But they also consider relevant other type of values, i.e. political values like equality, freedom, human dignity, etc., as these are expressed in their constitutional rights. Other religious citizens are much more radical in their faith. They are people for whom religion plays an integral role in their lives. For them, religion represents a ‘totalizing trait of a mode of believing that infuses the very pores of daily life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 8). In this sense, the religious values of these citizens are the most important normative element of their lives.</p>
<p>In the USDD there are also non-religious citizens. Some of them tolerate religion and are able to see it as an important part of social life, though not for them. Others are radical atheists who believe that ‘religion is the opiate of the people’. In some cases these radical atheists are passionately pro-science and believe that every religious viewpoint represents a false picture of the world. For these ‘scientistic citizens’, ‘religious convictions are false, illusory, or meaningless per se’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2009</xref>: 244).</p>
<p>The pluralism of the USDD is far more complex than this description but, for the sake of this article, let us group all the citizens in the following 4 categories: Radical Religious, Soft Religious, Soft Atheists and Radical Atheists.</p>
<p>As for the public political debate about the same-sex marriage law, many citizens of the first group, namely, the Radical Religious, firmly believe that homosexuality represents a perverse and abnormal behavior that, thus, cannot be protected by the state. These citizens justify their idea by appealing to an interpretation of the sacred book of their religion.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that a Radical Religious citizen intervenes in the debate by saying that the law should not be enacted because, as the Bible says, ‘If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads’ (Leviticus 20:13). This citizen clarifies that she is not proposing the death penalty for engaging in homosexual activities. Nonetheless, she wants to conclude that homosexuality should not be supported by the society or by the state. For many religious citizens this interpretation is unquestionable insofar as it is the authoritative interpretation of their religious community. Hence, a state that allows and protects the existence of same-sex marriage is equivalent to a state that allows and protects other sinful acts, such as murder itself. This argument is partially supported by some citizens belonging to the Soft Religious group, but is clearly rejected by both Soft Atheists and Radical Atheists.</p>
<p>Now, as mentioned before, according to Rawls it does not really matter if there is a majority of citizens that accepts the argument: a law in the USDD cannot be accepted or rejected based entirely on those kinds of reason. For Rawls, ‘reasonable comprehensive doctrines, religious or non-religious, may be introduced in public political discussion at any time, provided that in due course proper political reasons – and not reasons given solely by comprehensive doctrines – are presented that are sufficient to support whatever the comprehensive doctrines are said to support’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0191453713491264">Rawls, 1997</xref>: 783). This means that, besides the religious argument, the Radical Religious citizen would need to present another argument that does not depend completely on his or her religious faith. It is evident that the Soft Atheist and the Radical Atheist citizens will never accept a coercive policy based entirely upon religious reasons.</p>
<p>Many supporters of the law from the two Atheist groups of citizens are very happy with this proviso, especially those in the Radical Atheist group since, according to them, every religious reason is always, in one way or another, deceitful and alienated. In some sense, they would interpret Rawls’ proviso as establishing that religious reasons are reasons with very few values, or even no value, to constitute public reason. These citizens are confident that religious reasons and religious citizens, so devalued in the public sphere, will finally disappear.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Radical Religious citizen who proposed the argument does want to participate in the debate as a truly democratic deliberative citizen. But, it seems that the only way for her to do so is to have at hand non-religious reasons that allow her to oppose same-sex marriages. She can understand why many atheist citizens rejoice, namely, because, at the end of the day, she ought to propose only non-religious reasons for her position.</p>
<p>Perhaps many Soft Religious citizens might be able to come up with secular justifications. However, it seems unlikely that Radical Religious citizens might do so too, and this difficulty is not necessarily caused by a lack of imagination. It seems plausible that many Radical Religious citizens just do not understand why those reasons that originate in their religion, the most important feature of their lives, cannot count at all within the political system in which they live. After all, the USDD’s political constitution protects the right to religious freedom. In this sense, Rawls’ proposal seems to presuppose that religious citizens ‘will always have at their disposal two parallel pools of reasons to draw from. However, in cases of conflict between religious and non-religious reasons, it seems that being religious consists precisely in giving priority to religious over non-religious reasons in forming one’s own convictions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 130).</p>
<p>Rawls’ approach, thus, imposes a heavy mental and psychological burden on religious citizens. This burden might threaten political integration of those citizens in the USDD for they are left with only two choices if they want to participate in the public debates. First, they may abandon their religious radicalism and, perhaps, adopt a softer form of religion; or, second, they may stay as they are. But they should be aware that their freedom of speech and their right to participate in public deliberations are highly restricted. This means, thus, that in the USDD they happen to be second-class citizens, even though, as previously noted, their political constitution includes the right to religious freedom.</p>
<p>For these reasons, according to Habermas, Rawls’ approach needs to be corrected, or, at least, clarified. For Habermas, if it were the case of a debate taking place at, for example, the parliament, the religious argument would not be a valid argument for accepting or rejecting the law. Habermas accepts Rawls’ restriction but only for political deliberations taking place at the institutional level of parliaments, courts, ministries and administrations, i.e. in what he calls the formal public sphere. Nevertheless, for Habermas, the requirement of offering corroborating non-religious reasons in political deliberations developed within the <italic>informal </italic>public sphere must be eliminated. In this sphere, both Radical Religious and Soft Religious citizens can offer exclusively religious reasons to reject the law that intends to protect same-sex marriage. In other words, they can, if they want to, use the Leviticus argument to reject the law.</p>
<p>According to Habermas, they can hope that their religious reasons may be successfully translated into non-religious reasons. But this entails an obligation to translation assumed by all citizens. Habermas’ proposal indicates that the two kinds of religious citizens must accept that ultimately, in the formal public sphere, only non-religious reasons count for determining coercive policies addressed to all citizens. However, secular citizens, like all citizens, must share the burden of attempting to translate religious reasons into non-religious reasons. In order to do so, according to Habermas, all citizens have to take religious reasons seriously and cannot deny the potentially translatable truth content of religious reasons.</p>
<p>Habermas’ proposal seems to guarantee a better normative social integration of our 4 categories of citizens, insofar as it guarantees a legitimate place for religious citizens, both Radical Religious and Soft Religious, to express their own reasons in the informal public sphere. In this way, the informal public sphere is left open to possible learning processes and cultural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 134). Based on this theoretical normative framework, it seems that the debate on the same-sex marriage law can finally take place in a democratic way because all our 4 categories of citizens are allowed to participate. However, based on Lafont’s criticisms, Habermas’ normative framework might not be really successful. She points out 5 objections that I will present by expanding the example of the hypothetical debate on same-sex marriage.</p>
<sec id="section3-0191453713491264">
<title>Habermas’ institutional translation proviso</title>
<p>In Habermas’ approach, Radical Religious citizens are allowed to offer their most sincere and compelling reason to reject the same-sex marriage law. For them, the law should not be enacted because, according to their religious doctrine, homosexuality represents a perverse and abnormal behavior. One of these citizens, as we saw, quoted Leviticus 20:13 according to which ‘If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable’. This citizen offered this reason hoping to find a successful translation in order to affect the debate at the institutional level. But, how could that translation be done?</p>
<p>Let us suppose that one of their fellow citizens offers the following argument as a possible form of translation: 
<disp-quote>
<p>Sexual union is the reciprocal use that one human being makes of the sexual organs and capacities of another. This is either a natural use (by which procreation of a being of the same kind is possible) or an unnatural use, and unnatural use takes place either with a person of the same sex or with an animal of a nonhuman species. Since such transgressions of laws called unnatural or also unmentionable vices, do wrong to humanity in our own person, there are no limitations or exceptions whatsoever that can save them from being repudiated completely. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0191453713491264">Kant, 2009</xref>: 6:278 [pp. 426–7]) </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For this religious citizen the law should not be enacted because the state should privilege the natural unions over the unnatural ones. The notion of ‘marriage’ should be exclusively used for the former.</p>
<p>But, one might ask, does this argument really amount to a complete translation of the explicitly religious one? It seems it does not, insofar as it is completely dependent on a particular definition of ‘natural marriage’, a definition that does not have to be accepted by everyone. Hence, the alleged unnatural character of same-sex marriages is no longer clear. In the explicitly religious argument same-sex marriages are said to be unnatural, ultimately, because they contradict God’s commands as expressed in Leviticus 20:13. The new argument, in contrast, does not explicitly clarify the origins of the unnatural character of same-sex marriages. If, on the other hand, somehow the new argument depends on similar reasons about the immorality of homosexuality, then we have to conclude that it is not really a translation of the religious argument but that it is the same one. Either way, neither argument amounts to a true translation of the religious argument.</p>
<p>The Soft Religious citizen who offered the translation clarifies that heterosexual marriages are natural insofar as they are directed to procreation; a natural act for all human beings. Hence, the state should be interested in protecting and encouraging these kinds of union above all the others by giving them special and unique rights. But, once again, is this really a translation of the original religious argument? The first argument derives its conclusion (the law should not pass) from a strong moral and metaphysical claim about the perversion and abnormality of homosexuality as prohibited by God’s eternal laws (Leviticus 20:13). The second argument derives the same conclusion from the state’s alleged, but unproven, interest in promoting procreation.</p>
<p>It seems that in this case no successful translation is possible. For Lafont:
<disp-quote>
<p>Translation <italic>presupposes </italic>that it is possible to come to the same results by different epistemic means. Thus, in cases of genuine conflict between secular and religious reasons, officials would not be able to fulfill their translation obligation simply by virtue of the proviso. … In cases of conflict between secular and religious reasons Habermas’ ‘institutional translation proviso’ leads to the same exclusion of religious reasons as does Rawls’ proviso. Adding that the exclusion only operates ‘beyond the institutional threshold’ can hardly silence the objection, given that this is precisely <italic>when it matters most</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 134–5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion is, once again, the same. Radical Religious citizens are left with the two same options from Rawls’ model: (1) to develop political values that at least force them to accept the separation of church and state; or (2) to integrate within the USDD only as a modus vivendi.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that Lafont does not in fact disagree with the institutional proviso. Like Habermas, she agrees with the institutional precedence of secular reasons. In her view, this precedence is justified in the ‘legitimate protection against coercion that the state owes not only to secular citizens, but also to religious citizens with conflicting religious views, and that means to <italic>all </italic>citizens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 254). However, Lafont objects to Habermas in that his proposal seems to offer only an account of the potentially successful cases in which a secular translation of a religious argument is indeed possible. For Lafont, Habermas fails to underline ‘the alternative scenario in which no secular translations are to be found. In such cases it seems that his proposal would handicap cognitive learning by not allowing citizens to use all their cognitive resources to show why the policies at issue cannot be reasonably accepted by everyone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 258).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0191453713491264">
<title>The cognitive burdens that Habermas places on secular citizens</title>
<p>Just like in Rawls’ model, in Habermas’, the Radical Atheist citizens seem to be very satisfied with the fact ‘that in the long run, religious views will inevitably melt under the sun of scientific criticism and that religious communities will not be able to withstand the pressures of some unstoppable cultural and social modernization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 147).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Radical Atheist citizens are told that in Habermas’ proposal the habit that some of them have of not paying attention every time that any ‘irrational religious citizen’ offers religious reasons to reject same-sex marriage is not only rude behavior but a truly irrational and anti-democratic one. Even the non-dogmatic and non-hot-headed atheist citizens who do not leave the room or do not stop paying attention, are now told that in Habermas’ model they cannot think any more that religion is ‘the opiate of the people’. Otherwise, they too will be, perhaps not rude, but still irrational and anti-democratic.</p>
<p>As we saw before: 
<disp-quote>
<p>According to Habermas’ proposal, the corollary of allowing citizens of faith to use exclusively religious reasons for political advocacy in the informal public sphere is that secular citizens must exercise restraint concerning their ‘secularist attitudes’. Surprising as it may be, it turns out that they should not publicly adopt an epistemic stance toward religion according to which religion has ‘no cognitive substance’.

<p>Suddenly, many Radical Atheist citizens find themselves in a very discomforting place. They used to regard themselves as the most important agents of modernity. But now, according to Habermas, ‘they should not make public use of their sincere beliefs, if these beliefs happen to be of a secularist type that contradicts the possible truth of religious claims. In such cases they have no alternative but to be disingenuous and come up with alternate reasons that are independent of their authentic beliefs in order to participate in public deliberation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 135).</p>
<p>Many Radical Atheist citizens do not understand why their fellow religious citizens are allowed to adopt their own cognitive stances in the informal public sphere and offer exclusively religious reasons against same-sex marriage but, at the same time, they, the ‘illustrated and emancipated ones’, have to open their minds to the possible truth of religious beliefs. Surprisingly enough, they find themselves in the same situation as their fellow Radical Religious citizens. They are left with two options. First, they may abandon their atheistic radicalism and, perhaps, adopt a softer form of atheism. Or second, they may stay as they are. But, they should be aware, nonetheless, that their freedom of speech and their right to participate in public deliberations are highly restricted. Somehow in the USDD they happen to be second-class citizens.</p>
<p>Lafont’s second objection refers to Habermas’ unjustified notion of what being a ‘rational-democratic’ citizen means. Habermas’ account seems to presuppose that a secularistic citizen can be neither rational nor democratic. In Lafont’s words, ‘I fail to see anything irrational in citizens who believe “that, in the long run, religious views will inevitably melt under the sun of scientific criticism and that religious communities will not be able to withstand the pressures of some unstoppable cultural and social modernization”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 147).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0191453713491264">7</xref>
</sup> According to Lafont, Habermas is incoherent because he, on the one hand, accepts that the proper understanding of modernity is a contested issue but, on the other, requires secular citizens to embrace the post-secular diagnosis over the secularist. For Lafont, ‘universal acceptance of the post-secular diagnosis in the absence of conclusive evidence does not seem a particularly recommendable scenario from a purely epistemic point of view’ (ibid.). Thus, in imposing a cognitive precondition on secular citizens, Habermas is taking sides on what is admittedly a contested issue among the affected citizens themselves. In this sense, ‘his version of the ethics of citizenship constitutes an attempt to influence the outcome from the outside, and in so doing it seems clearly to overstep the normative limits imposed by the discourse principle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 30).</p>
<p>In our debate, then, any Radical Religious citizen would be entitled to offer an argument against same-sex marriage based on his or her religious perspective on the perversions of homosexuality but, at the same time, no Radical Atheist citizen would be allowed to express her or his beliefs according to which religion is ‘the opiate of the people’. In summary, Habermas’ proposal seems to be arbitrary insofar as for him any religious comprehensive view is allowed in the informal public sphere for the sake of mutual learning processes, but, simultaneously, no secularist view has the same right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 248).</p>

<title>Habermas’ idea of a meaningless debate</title>
<p>Habermas justifies the burden that he places on Radical Atheist citizens as a way to avoid a meaningless debate among citizens who maintain their own secular or religious cognitive stances. Undoubtedly, if all Radical Atheist citizens reject the Leviticus argument simply for being produced by a manipulated and deceived mind, we might have serious difficulties reaching a final normative consensus. In a more dramatic scenario, Radical Atheist citizens might decide to leave the room if religious arguments are allowed. But, maybe this does not have to be the case. For Lafont: 
<disp-quote>
<p>… it is hard to see why a serious engagement in this debate would require secular citizens to open their minds to the possible truth of religious claims against homosexuality. It seems to me that a perfectly serious way of engaging in that debate is to offer the objections and counter-arguments needed to show why the proposed policy is wrong. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 136–7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lafont, in this sense, has a different understanding of what ‘taking religious reasons seriously’ might mean. As she sees it, for Habermas it means avoiding a secularist perspective. For Lafont, in contrast, it only means ‘to <italic>evaluate them strictly on their merits </italic>and thus to be prepared to offer the counter arguments and counter evidence needed to show why they may be wrong, in case one thinks they are’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 249).</p>
<p>Let us suppose, then, that in our debate, none of the Radical Atheist citizens leaves the room. They listen when their fellow religious citizens express their arguments, no matter how fundamentalist or radical they seem. However, no Radical Atheist citizen affirms that those arguments are produced by a deceived consciousness. They certainly think they are, but they are also aware that in that room and in that moment neither the validity of religion nor the existence of God are being discussed.</p>
<p>A Radical Atheist citizen may sincerely believe that religions are not merely ‘archaic relics of pre-modern societies’, but, even worse, ‘the opiate of the people’. Nevertheless, as long as she provides counter-arguments for all the religious claims brought to the informal public sphere, she is fulfilling her obligations as a democratic citizen. For Lafont, even if this citizen is a recalcitrant secularist, inasmuch as she provides her best arguments and reasons for public deliberation in the informal public sphere, she has the same right as any religious person to participate in the debate. Her secularistic perspective does not make any meaningful difference to her capacity to meet her political obligations as a democratic citizen.</p>
<p>As Lafont puts it, ‘Since the discussion of the ethics of citizenship concerns political obligations, it seems to me that the obligation to “take seriously” the views of our fellow citizens on contentious legislative decisions has a specifically <italic>political </italic>rather than merely cognitive meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 137). In this sense, Radical Atheist citizens do not have to open their minds to the possible truths of religion pertaining to the perversion of homosexuality. All they have to do is to provide arguments to support, in this case, the same-sex marriage law. For instance, they could indicate to their fellow religious citizens that their moral and religious arguments ultimately imply a harsh discrimination and an institutionalization of second-class citizens. They could simply say that gay and lesbian couples should be treated no differently than their heterosexual counterparts and that they should be able to marry like anyone else.</p>
<p>For Lafont, Habermas’ approach tacitly fails to draw a distinction between (1) the right to include in public political debate whatever views and reasons one honestly believes, and (2) the right<italic> to be released from the obligation to engage reasons generally acceptable </italic>to democratic citizens in order to check whether the coercive policies one favors can be justified to all citizens who must comply with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 138). Habermas clearly seems to grant the first right to all religious citizens. But, according to Lafont, he should do the same for Radical Atheist citizens. As for the second right, it does not seem like the kind of right that Habermas would grant to anyone. However, for Lafont, it is a right that is tacitly given to religious citizens, derived from the new burden imposed on secular citizens. In Lafont’s words, ‘as a consequence, religious citizens would have the right to exercise whichever political influence their religious reasons may have on other (similarly minded) citizens <italic>without </italic>the reciprocal obligation of making such advocacy responsive to the scrutiny of generally acceptable reasons and objections brought to bear by other citizens’ (ibid.: 139).<sup>

<title>Habermas’ silence about citizens’ obligation when casting their votes</title>
<p>If we continue expanding our example, we can think that in the most heated moment of the discussion one of the Radical Religious citizens suggests what seems to be a non-religious argument: ‘Let the people vote.’ This citizen, in this sense, attempts to close the debate by recurring to an inherently democratic mechanism, that is, voting. According to Lafont, Habermas’ position on this issue is unclear. Although he does not explicitly address the issue of how ordinary citizens should cast their votes on fundamental political questions, he seems to accept that religious citizens may cast their votes on the basis of their religious convictions. When Habermas is referring to this crucial issue, he affirms that ‘certainly the normative expectation that all religious citizens when casting their vote should in the final instance let themselves be guided by secular considerations is to ignore the realities of a devout life, an existence led in light of belief’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>However, if religious citizens are allowed to vote based entirely on religious reasons, Habermas’ central normative principle, according to which only secular reasons should count in determining coercive political decisions, seems absolutely undermined. On the other hand, if religious reasons cannot be taken into account when citizens cast their votes, Habermas’ model ‘collapses into the Rawlsian approach it aims to modify. It lets religious citizens include religious reasons in political debates in the informal public sphere, but when it comes to casting their votes it does not let them base their political decisions on religious reasons if corroborating secular reasons cannot be found’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 140).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0191453713491264">
<title>The ‘real’ applicability of Habermas’ proposal</title>
<p>Ultimately, it seems that in Habermas’ model, the United States of Deliberative Democracies is presupposed to have only two categories of citizens, namely, the Soft Religious and the Soft Atheists. Both Radical Religious and Radical Atheists do not seem able to comply with their obligations as deliberative democratic citizens if they maintain their radical cognitive stances. However, ‘[c]ertainly, no one would deny that if citizens’ cognitive stances were to become similar enough the problem of political integration would eventually disappear. But it can hardly count as a way to solve the problem of political integration under conditions of pluralism to simply hope that the problem evaporates if and when some extremes of the spectrum disappear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 147). According to Lafont, one of the advantages of Habermas’ model is that it is very concerned with the possibility of allowing a genuine learning process from within religious traditions. For Habermas, the results of this learning process would allow religious citizens to ‘understand the relationship of dogmatic and secular beliefs in such a way that the autonomous progress in secular knowledge will not contradict their faith … At that point, the potential incompatibility between religious and democratic obligations of citizens of faith would simply disappear’ (ibid.: 140). But there is also a correlated learning process for secular citizens. Indeed, they must adopt an epistemic attitude toward religion that enables them to learn from the reasons offered by their fellow religious citizens. However, as Lafont says, although this seems highly desirable, politics is the realm of the <italic>here and now</italic>. In our example, the 4 categories of citizens might end up deciding the discussion with a poll, and it seems that if they follow Habermas’ model, very few of them can find a way to act according to the obligations of a truly democratic deliberative citizen.</p>

<title>A response to Lafont's objections</title>
<p>As I said before, in one way or another, all the 5 objections are present in Lafont’s texts. Nonetheless, to be sure, only the second and the third objections are the ones that she deeply develops insofar as, in her view, they ground the possibility for her own account of the subject, an account that attempts to present a better mediation than the one offered by Habermas. For this reason, before presenting my responses to Lafont’s objections I need to further insist upon Lafont’s ‘mediator perspective’, a perspective that, although not completely inaccurate, does miss certain key elements of Habermas’ approach. When I answer Lafont’s second and third objections, I will try to show that they are partially inspired by her ‘mediator interpretation’ and by her overemphasis on sincerity as an essential presupposition for reaching normative agreements. Once these two elements are understood in a different sense, closer to what Habermas is really doing, the objections lose their force.</p>
<p>I stated before that Lafont interprets Habermas’ account as if he were mediating between the liberal emphasis ‘on the citizen’s obligation to provide reasons acceptable to everyone in support of coercive policies to which all must comply, and the critic’s insistence on the right of religious citizens to adopt their religious stance in public deliberation about such policies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 129). For Lafont, Habermas’ mediation is aimed to defend the ideal of the deliberative democracy, an ideal that presupposes an account of how, under conditions of pluralism, public deliberation can bring about agreement without exclusion (ibid.: 128).</p>
<p>Thus, when considered in this broader scenario, Habermas’ proposal fails because although it defends pluralism, represented by the possibility of expressing religious reasons in the informal public sphere, it also endangers it in virtue of the burdens imposed on secular citizens. For Lafont, Habermas’ rejection of secularism represents an illegitimate reduction of pluralism. My example attempted to show that the Radical Atheist citizens were forced to adopt a softer form of atheism or restrict their participation in public deliberations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0191453713491264">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Lafont’s own proposal aims to defend pluralism in a more radical sense. She wants to save enough space for the secularist views to be heard in the public sphere. But Lafont is not only interested in pluralism per se. Lafont’s insistence on pluralism, manifested in her desire to justify a place for the secularist views, is based on the necessity that citizens maintain their own cognitive stances in order to reach true normative agreements. According to Lafont, citizens’ reasonable assent is only possible if they are able to judge the debated policies strictly on their merits. For her, this presupposes that they must be 
<disp-quote>
<p>… allowed to adopt their own cognitive stance, whatever it may be, when they participate in political deliberation in the public sphere. For, only if they provide the arguments and counter-arguments they sincerely believe are right regarding the policies under discussion will they then be able to follow the ‘unforced force of the better argument’, to use Habermas’ term, and reach a conclusion in good faith on the acceptability of those policies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 128) </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is why Lafont remarks so emphatically that, in Habermas’ account, secular citizens with secularist beliefs, in contradistinction to religious citizens, are forced to be disingenuous and offer alternative reasons that are different from their authentic beliefs in order to be allowed to participate in public deliberations. For Lafont, this is highly problematic because forcing citizens’ cognitive dishonesty should be unacceptable ‘regardless of whether those citizens have a religious or secularist stance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 248).</p>
<p>Lafont’s eager defense of pluralism and sincerity inspires her proposal of <italic>mutual accountability </italic>where she wants to keep a more pluralistic view of the obligations of democratic citizenship understood as one that recognizes <italic>the right of all democratic citizens</italic> <italic>to take their own cognitive stance in public deliberation </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 141). In Lafont’s first article, she posits the necessity of supporting an ethics of democratic citizenship that requires no self-restraint from democratic citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 249). Similarly, in her second article, where she fully develops her proposal, she maintains that her point is that ‘no one has the <italic>obligation </italic>to engage in a way of thinking entirely foreign to their own cognitive stance, whether religious or secular, to seriously participate in public deliberation about coercive policies with which all must comply’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 143).</p>
<sec id="section9-0191453713491264">
<title>Objection one</title>
<p>Lafont’s first objection refers to Habermas’ institutional translation proviso. My example attempts to illustrate how, for Lafont, in a genuine conflict between religious and public reason, ‘the requirements of Habermas’ “institutional translation proviso”, though certainly less demanding than Rawls’, would be equally impossible to meet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 134).</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Lafont does not really disagree with the institutional proviso. She justifies the precedence of secular reasons as a way to protect all citizens, secular but also religious, against coercion. In this sense, the priority of secular reasons is also justified as a way to preserve religious diversity.</p>
<p>What Lafont does criticize in Habermas’ account is that it seems to be focused only on the potentially successful cases in which a secular translation of a religious argument is possible. For Lafont, Habermas does not underline the cases in which no secular translations are available. In Lafont’s own words, which I would like to quote again, in those cases, Habermas’ proposal ‘would handicap cognitive learning by not allowing citizens to use all their cognitive resources to show why the policies at issue cannot be reasonably accepted by everyone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 258).</p>
<p>When I answer the second and third objections, I will show with more detail that Habermas does offer very good reasons to conclude that a secularistic perspective does not have anything to offer for learning processes. Briefly put, as I will show, for Habermas such a perspective does not contribute to the debates in the public sphere, and aims to restrict perspectives that do. In this sense, Lafont should offer a deeper explanation of how a secularistic perspective expressed in an argument can be useful as a cognitive resource to show all citizens, but especially the religious ones, that the same-sex marriage law should be approved.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0191453713491264">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, Habermas’ proposal does have the elements to give an account of the cases in which no secular translations are available. Indeed, based on his view, any citizen, religious or secular, could contest any religious argument by indicating that it is not coping with the fact of pluralism, or not respecting the public authority of the sciences, or, more relevant for our example, not accepting the egalitarianism of our constitutional principles. Thus, Habermas’ proposal does offer the resources to distinguish the many cases in which nothing can be learned from a religious argument.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Lafont does acknowledge a crucial distinction that, nonetheless, she does not find relevant. In her own words:
<disp-quote>
<p>It could perhaps be argued that the kind of open-mindedness towards the possible truth of religious views to which Habermas appeals does not directly refer to the particular content of those views, but concerns only a meta-attitude towards religions in general. According to this line of argument, secular citizens should meet the cognitive precondition of being open-minded towards the possible cognitive substance of religions in general, although when it comes to particular beliefs or claims (like those concerning creationism or the Virgin Birth) they may not need to be equally open to their possible truth. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 258)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I think that what Habermas is proposing is in fact an open meta-attitude towards religion in general. However, despite acknowledging such a distinction, it seems that Lafont’s objections against Habermas, as well as her own proposal, remain caught within the second possibility, one which Habermas is not contemplating. In this sense, it seems as if Lafont had interpreted Habermas’ account as proposing that being open-minded to religion means being open-minded to all the particular contents of religious views.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0191453713491264">
<title>Objection two</title>
<p>Lafont’s second objection refers to Habermas’ cognitive burdens imposed on secular citizens according to which they must open their minds to recognize the potentially translatable truth content of religious reasons. Briefly put, Lafont thinks that Habermas does not justify how, within the context of a contestable proper understanding of modernity, secular citizens must embrace the post-secular diagnosis over the secularist.</p>
<p>I think that, although it is not fully developed in his text, Habermas does provide a justification that goes in the direction suggested by Lafont. This justification is to be found in his reflections on religion, upon which, interestingly enough, Lafont does not comment at all.</p>
<p>For Habermas, ‘Every religion is originally a “conception of the world” or a “comprehensive doctrine” in the sense that it claims the authority to structure a form of life in its entirety” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006b</xref>: 259). Nevertheless, Habermas maintains that religions are a very special sort of comprehensive doctrine. According to him, religious traditions are particularly capable of articulating moral intuitions, especially with regard to vulnerable forms of communal life. In his text ‘On the Relations between the Secular Liberal State and Religion’ Habermas had already affirmed that ‘holy writings and religious traditions articulate, subtly spell out, and hermeneutically keep alive over thousands of years intuitions about fall and redemption, about a saving exit from a life experienced as being without salvation’ (ibid.: 257). For Habermas, in the life of religious communities, there still remain intact experiences and intuitions about ‘sufficiently differentiated possibilities of expression and sensibilities for misspent life, for societal pathologies, for the failure of individual life plans and the deformation to be seen in distorted life contexts’ (ibid.).</p>
<p>At first sight, in the Leviticus argument presented in the hypothetical debate it is very hard to appreciate any of those ‘positive’ aspects that Habermas thinks can be found in religious doctrines. In this sense, Lafont is right when she says that it is very difficult to see why secular citizens should open their minds to the potentially translatable truth content of religious claims concerning the perversity of homosexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 142). However, if we were to develop the example more fully we might see different aspects. For example, we can think of a different Religious citizen who offers another interpretation of the Leviticus argument. According to her what this passage is saying is that throughout history every society has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. This citizen’s interpretation sees that there is a very powerful reason for that, namely, to defend the future itself of society as represented by stable and safe unions in which healthy children can be raised. Hence, according to this allegedly secular translation, the law should not be approved in virtue of the potential and unmeasured damages it could have on the mental and physical health of children. For this citizen, the laws in the USDD are built upon a Judeo-Christian world-view, which has been expressed in their laws on marriage throughout the history of his country. But what those laws really express, by affirming that marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman, is that society should always encourage what is best for children, namely, a mother and a father who raise them in a stable and protected relationship called ‘marriage’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0191453713491264">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Expressed in this way, the argument now depends upon two ‘extra-religious’ claims: on the one hand, the historical claim according to which ‘every human society has always privileged the institution of marriage over other kinds of relationships’; and, on the other, the ‘medical’ claim according to which mentally and physically healthy children can only be raised by a family constituted by a man and a woman. Those two claims can now be contested by indicating the multiple types of family unions that have existed in different societies and in different time-periods. In addition, the claim about the children’s health can also be disputed by appealing to scientific research proving the opposite. Developed in this way, the example now shows how and why, for Habermas, every citizen, including of course religious citizens, should accept the authority of scientific knowledge in order to fulfill the normative expectations of democratic citizenship. In other words, once a claim susceptible of being debated by scientific means is raised in the public sphere, the institutionalized monopoly of modern scientific experts should have a privileged position that must be taken into account.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that, for Habermas, religious consciousness is not petrified, rigid and unchangeable. Religion, contrarily, has gone through a very complex process of adaptation. For him: ‘Under the circumstances of the secularization of knowledge, of the neutralization of state authority, and of the generalized freedom of religion, religion has had to give up this claim to interpretive monopoly and to a comprehensive organization of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006b</xref>: 259). In virtue of its evolving character, Habermas sees it as feasible for communities of faith to be able (1) to develop an epistemic attitude toward other religions and world-views that they encounter within a universe of discourse hitherto occupied only by their own religion, (2) to develop an epistemic stance toward the independence of secular knowledge from sacred knowledge and the institutionalized monopoly of modern scientific experts, and (3) to develop an epistemic stance toward the priority that secular reasons enjoy in the political arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 13–14).</p>
<p>Of particular interest for us is the last specification of Habermas’ burdens on religious citizens. According to Habermas, it entails that religious citizens must connect the main tenets of their doctrines with the egalitarian individualism and universalism of modern law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 13–14). In our fictitious debate, this becomes an important problem that must be faced by the two groups of religious citizens. If they are not able to connect the egalitarian individualism and universalism of modern law with the premises of their religion, they fail in their duties as democratic citizens. And, indeed, secular citizens, radical or soft, are in a good position for showing them this failure.</p>
<p>If a religious belief is clearly incompatible with constitutional values, there is nothing to learn there. Nonetheless, given the special character that Habermas ascribes to religion, he also wants to leave open the space for religious arguments. Accordingly, no citizen is in a position to judge a priori, that is, before hearing the religious arguments, that there is nothing valuable in them. A failed case of translation is not enough to reject the possibility of translation itself; especially when it is not difficult to find many relevant cases of successful translations. In his own words, for instance: 
<disp-quote>
<p>The translation of the notion of man’s likeness to God into the notion of human dignity, in which all men partake equally and which is to be respected unconditionally, is such a saving translation. The translation renders the content of biblical concepts accessible to the general public of people of other faiths, as well as to nonbelievers, beyond the boundaries of a particular religious community. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006b</xref>: 257)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Returning to our debate, we could also think of another Religious citizen offering a very different kind of religious argument. Let us suppose the following scenario: here is a citizen who had been uncomfortably witnessing the intensity of the debate between the Radical Atheist citizen, who thinks religion is the opiate of the people, and the Radical Religious citizen, who thinks that, based on Leviticus, homosexuality is a human perversion. This citizen is a heterosexual woman who has been married for years. In this sense, she does not seem to have any particular direct interest in the law. However, she feels that she just cannot stand the perpetration of an injustice. Indeed, this citizen has an interpretation of Christianity that ‘includes positively within itself what appears to go contrary to life. It teaches us to view as divine even what is repugnant, odious, and loathsome: “Lowliness and poverty, scorn and contempt, disgrace and misery, suffering and death”; it even teaches us to love sin and crime as ways by which to go forward’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0191453713491264">Löwith, 1991</xref>: 23).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0191453713491264">12</xref>
</sup> To be sure, she does not think that homosexuality is described by any of those adjectives. But her religious perspective, based on such principle of love, motivates her to fight harshly against any kind of discrimination. This would be, then, according to Habermas himself a radical religious citizen for whom religion also represents a totalizing trait of a mode of believing that rules her entire life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 8).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0191453713491264">13</xref>
</sup> Nonetheless, for this citizen, homosexual couples should not be discriminated against in any way.</p>
<p>This citizen disagrees with the way in which her fellow religious citizens are using the sacredness of marriage as an argument to reject its extension to same-sex couples. From such a perspective, gay couples might aspire to develop, at the most, some sort of ‘erotic love’, but never the kind of love blessed by God that only a man and a woman are able to achieve. Only for these sorts of relationships should the institution of marriage be reserved. However, for her, aside from the fact that this perspective usually commits one to the idea that reproduction is a necessary goal of marriage (a conception that would seem to be very close to a hard naturalistic view of human relations), the defenders of that view also seem to presuppose that homosexual people are not able to cultivate a sort of ‘sacred moral love’. In this sense, what actually seems to be presupposed here is the idea that homosexual people are less committed to monogamy than straight people. Hence, same-sex marriages would really be ‘open marriages’ where the two people involved would have a weaker commitment to one another sexually, psychologically, socially and emotionally. Thus, the argument continues, in case of having children, the negative consequences of their weak commitment would be devastating for them. For her, nonetheless, this way of reasoning might constitute a good case for the application of the Parable of the Good Samaritan interpreted as emphasizing the idea that a person of a social group ‘commonly disapproved’ is indeed able to exhibit moral behavior superior to the behavior displayed by people from ‘approved groups’.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Doubtless, this citizen belongs to a minority group within the larger categories of Radical Religious and Soft Religious citizens. However, her voice, in Habermas’ account, should also be heard in the informal public sphere, and, in this case, it does seem to be a voice from which secular citizens can learn. For a secularist citizen, nonetheless, this religious perspective would be as deceitful and false as the other ones. It is noteworthy, then, that Habermas’ proposal is aware of two complex phenomena that secularism is not able to see, namely, (1) religious diversity and (2) the existence of inter-and intra-religious domination.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0191453713491264">15</xref>
</sup> In Habermas’ words, ‘Secular citizens or those of other religious persuasions can also learn something from religious contributions under certain circumstances, for example, when they recognize buried intuitions of their own in the normative truth contents of a religious utterance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2008</xref>: 131).</p>
<p>In this sense, the third Radical Religious citizen would be on the same side as a Soft Atheist citizen who proposes the following argument. For this Soft Atheist citizen, the law does not constitute a threat against the sacred institution of marriage but, contrarily, a safeguard. In this sense, this citizen thinks that a society with successful marriages is indeed a more stable, safer and, in general terms, better society. For him, one of the USDD’s problems is that it has too few marriages. Thus, he thinks that it is good to extend marriages to homosexual people. For this citizen, then: 
<disp-quote>
<p>The signal we need to send now is that everybody should be getting married. The big cultural problem with the family in [USDD] is not that gay people want to get married – it’s that straight people are not getting married or not staying married. And to me, one of the important cultural effects of gay marriage will be to send a very strong signal that marriage is something that is available to and expected of everybody, not just a few.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This last religious citizen exemplifies the case of a citizen whose religious values, which do not contradict the political value of equality, motivate her to participate in the political debate seeking public good. For Habermas, this is indeed the kind of attitude that characterizes a citizen of a liberal state. As he puts it:
<disp-quote>
<p>Citizens should actively exercise their communicative and participatory rights, not only with regard to their own best interests but also with respect to the public good. This requires a greater motivational outlay, one that cannot be legally commanded … The readiness, if need be, to vouch for one’s fellow citizens, although they are and remain unknown to oneself, as well as the willingness to sacrifice one’s own concerns for the general interest may only be suggested to the citizens [<italic>Burger</italic>] of a liberal community. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006b</xref>: 253–4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From this perspective, religion is regarded by Habermas as a force able to generate the motivational resources that every democracy needs, especially since, in Habermas’ model of democracy, citizens have to be conceived as authors of the law rather than their being merely addressees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006b</xref>: 253).</p>
<p>Thus, besides Habermas’ reflections on religion, there is another line of justification for excluding secularism from the public use of reason. Briefly put, it is a consequence of the ethics of citizenship that should be embraced by citizens who accept the constitution of the liberal state. In Habermas’ own words, ‘It is therefore also in the constitutional state’s own interest to treat with care all cultural sources upon which the consciousness of norms and the solidarity of citizens draw … The ideological neutrality of state authority, which guarantees the same ethical freedoms for every citizen, is incompatible with the political generalization of a secularistic worldview’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006b</xref>: 258–60).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0191453713491264">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the state expects that religious communities integrate the universalistic system of law and the egalitarian morals of society within their own ethos. Only in this way, religious communities keep their expectations of influencing, via the political public, society as a whole. But, if the liberal state recognizes in this way the existence and importance of its religious citizens, it also expects, at least in the field of the ethics of citizenship, that secular citizens do not assess such recognition merely as a pragmatic protection of an irrational past. For Habermas, then, there are three requirements that the liberal state demands from its secular citizens. First, they cannot deny out of hand the potential for truth in religious conceptions of the world. Second, they cannot dispute the right of believing fellow citizens to make contributions to public debates that are phrased in religious language. Third, they are even expected to participate in efforts to translate relevant contributions from a religious language into a publicly accessible one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006b</xref>: 260).</p>
<p>For Habermas, religion’s worth in the process of secularization as well as its value within a liberal state is not a contested issue. In ‘Religion in the Public Sphere’, Habermas acknowledges the empirical fact of the relevance of religion around the world. He also recognizes that, empirically, the statistical evidence shows that the interpretations of modernity are a contested issue. In Habermas’ words:
<disp-quote>
<p>Religious traditions and communities of faith have gained a new, hitherto unexpected political importance since the epochmaking change of 1989–90 … There is statistical evidence of a wave of secularization in almost all European countries since the end of World War II – going hand in hand with social modernization. By contrast, for the United States all data show that the comparatively large proportion of the population made up of devout and religiously active citizens has remained constant over the last six decades … Against this background, the split within the West is rather perceived as if Europe were isolating itself from the rest of the world. Seen in terms of world history, Max Weber’s ‘Occidental Rationalism’ now appears to be the actual deviation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 1–2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It must be noted, however, that what Habermas accepts as uncertain with regard to modernity is the question about the European process of secularization being the exception or the rule, an issue that might remain disputed for a long time insofar as it is directly related to the future of religion within the much broader context of a world society. In Habermas’ words:
<disp-quote>
<p>It would not be reasonable to reject out of hand the idea that the world religions – as the only remaining element of the distant cultures of the Old Empires – assert a place for themselves in the differentiated architecture of Modernity because their cognitive substance has not yet waned. We cannot at any rate exclude the thought that they still bear a semantic potential that unleashes an inspiring energy for all of society as soon as they release their profane truth content. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What is contested, then, is the idea that the cognitive substance of religious thought will one day wane. Nevertheless, given that it has not disappeared, one may perfectly reasonably conclude that the door must be left opened.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0191453713491264">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In this sense, Lafont’s mediator perspective is also imprecise because if we were to interpret Habermas’ proposal as mediating between two extremes, one of the extremes would not be the ‘fact of pluralism’ as such (nor the criticism against Rawls’ approach derived from the right to speech of religious citizens). It would be the continuous and valuable existence of religious traditions and communities. However, Lafont does not seem to be interested in discussing Habermas’ remarks on the nature and value of religion. Even though he offers a perspective according to which religion is a very special kind of comprehensive doctrine that, thus, deserves a ‘special treatment’, at least in any theoretical approach.<sup>

<sec id="section11-0191453713491264">
<title>Objection three</title>
<p>Lafont’s third objection refers to Habermas’ presuppositions for developing a meaningful debate in the informal public sphere between secular and religious citizens. For Habermas, such meaningful debate requires that secular citizens avoid a secularistic perspective. For Lafont, in contrast, it only requires the pragmatic willingness from secular citizens to offer counter-arguments and counter-evidence to the arguments presented by religious citizens.</p>
<p>Lafont’s disagreement with Habermas is rooted in what seems to be her own understanding of deliberative democracy and the role that sincerity plays in it for the development of an ethics of citizenship. Indeed, in her own account Lafont puts a lot of effort into distinguishing between (1) a right to include in public political debates whatever perspective and argument one honestly believes and (2) a right to be released from the obligation to engage the views of others in order to justify to them the coercive policies one favors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 252). Ultimately, what Lafont wants to do in her own proposal is to grant to all citizens the first of those rights. In her own words, ‘it seems clear that a proper account of the ethics of citizenship must recognize <italic>the right of all democratic citizens to take their own cognitive stance in public deliberation</italic>’ (ibid.: 253). For her, Habermas is mistaken in granting such right to the religious citizens but not to the secularist ones. As a consequence, says Lafont, Habermas is also tacitly granting the second right to religious citizens, and, for Lafont, this entails that ‘religious citizens would have the right to exercise whichever political influence their religious reasons may have on other (similarly minded) citizens <italic>without </italic>the reciprocal obligation of making such advocacy responsive to the scrutiny of generally acceptable reasons and objections brought to bear by other citizens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 138).</p>
<p>I will answer this third objection by showing that Habermas’ account does not imply, at any moment, that religious citizens are released from the obligation to engage the views of others, especially secular views. In the answer to the second objection it has already been shown that Habermas’ account, in some sense, even encourages inter-religious discussions in the informal public sphere. But now I want to insist on the constraints that the religious citizens must accept and that in many ways affect them even in their participation in political debates within the informal public sphere. In addition, I will analyse in more detail Lafont’s alleged right to include in public political debates whatever perspective and argument one honestly believes. I will show that the unavoidable nuances that such right has imply, at the end, that Lafont’s account collapses into Habermas’ perspective.</p>
<p>At first sight, Habermas’ account seems to constitute a defense of religious citizens. As such, it appears as if Habermas is completely interested in protecting religious citizens without taking into account the effects his deliberative obligations have on secular citizens. For this reason, in certain societies in which religious arguments are commonly offered and taken into account within the public sphere (both formal and informal), Habermas’ proposal might not have much applicability.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it has to be noticed that Habermas never stops emphasizing the burdens that religious citizens have to accept if they really want to be democratic citizens. They have to admit that in the liberal state, government and its legitimacy are rooted in secular grounds. In Habermas’ words, ‘the constitution of the liberal state is self-sufficient with regard to its need for legitimation, that is, … it can draw upon the resources of a set of arguments that are independent of religious and metaphysical traditions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006b</xref>: 253). Thus, even if in the informal public sphere religious citizens are allowed to express religious arguments, they should do so knowing that ultimately their arguments will have to be measured against the standards derived from the fact of pluralism, the public authority of the sciences and the egalitarianism of constitutional principles. In this sense, although indirectly, religious citizens are in fact constrained in debates that take place in the informal public sphere. At the end of the day, as Habermas puts it:
<disp-quote>
<p>What must be safeguarded is that the decisions of the legislator, the executive branch, and the courts are not only <italic>formulated </italic>in a universally accessible language, but are also <italic>justified </italic>on the basis of universally acceptable reasons. This excludes religious reasons from decisions about all state-sanctioned – that is, legally binding – norms. Apart from that, I do not believe that secular citizens can learn anything from fundamentalist doctrines that cannot cope with the fact of pluralism, with the public authority of the sciences, and with the egalitarianism of our constitutional principles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0191453713491264">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, for Habermas, the participants in the debate of our example should not reject the Leviticus argument simply on account of its religious aspect, nor can they refer to the lack of corroborating secular reasons provided by the same citizen that offered it. The reasons to reject the argument, in contrast, have to be of the kind just mentioned, namely, reasons pertaining to the non-recognition of pluralism, the public authority of the sciences, or the egalitarianism of our constitutional principles.</p>
<p>Habermas’ proposal does not entail any <italic>right to be released from the obligation to engage reasons generally acceptable</italic> to democratic citizens, as Lafont suggests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 138–9). Religious citizens who participate in the debates developed in the informal public sphere of a liberal state are always constrained by the democratic principles of such state, even if they participate by offering exclusively religious arguments. It is clearly expected that the kind of arguments to which Lafont indicates every citizen must respond will indeed be presented even in the debates within the informal public sphere,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0191453713491264">21</xref>
</sup> and thus religious citizens will have to deal with them too. In summary, no right to be released from the obligation to engage the views of others in order to justify to them the coercive policies one favors is being granted by Habermas to any citizen.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0191453713491264">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Similarly, the first of Lafont’s rights, namely, the right to include in public political debates whatever views and reasons one honestly believes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 138), needs to be analysed in more detail. It is noteworthy that such right constitutes the core of her proposal of <italic>mutual accountability</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 141). Moreover, this right is based upon Lafont’s strong positing of sincerity as one of the most important presuppositions for reaching justified agreements in the political debates (ibid.: 128).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0191453713491264">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We have to notice that, at least for Habermas, sincerity has to be interpreted along with other presuppositions for fruitful argumentation. In addition it has to be qualified by the nature of the kind of debate that is being developed, namely a political debate about the potential promulgation of a law. In Habermas’ view, ‘If the process of argumentation is to live up to its meaning, communication in the form of rational discourse must, if possible, allow all relevant information and explanations to be brought up and weighed so that the stance participants take can be intrinsically motivated solely by the revisionary power of free-floating reasons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2005</xref>: 106). Hence, a meaningful and normative fruitful discussion, even in the public sphere, either formal or informal, must meet the 4 most important pragmatic presuppositions in order to ‘seriously count as argumentation’ (ibid.).</p>
<p>These presuppositions are:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>publicity and inclusiveness: no one who could make a relevant contribution with regard to a controversial validity-claim must be excluded;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>equal rights to engage in communication: everyone must have the same opportunity to speak on the matter at hand;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>exclusion of deception and illusion: participants have to mean what they say; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>absence of coercion: communication must be free of restrictions that prevent the better argument from being raised or from determining the outcome of the discussion. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2005</xref>: 107)</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>But, according to Habermas, ‘since the participants in practical discourses are simultaneously the ones who are affected, presupposition (3) – which <italic>in theoretical-empirical disputes</italic> requires only a sincere and unconstrained weighing of the arguments – takes on the further significance that one remain critically alert to self-deception as well as hermeneutically open and sensitive to how others understand themselves and the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2005</xref>: 106–7).</p>
<p>In addition, it has to be noticed that Habermas’ account does not refer to just any sort of practical discussion. For this reason, the 4 presuppositions have to be reinterpreted in the context of a political debate within the informal public sphere of a liberal state about the pros and cons of the enactment of a law. In other words, we must bear in mind that Habermas’ proposal, even if it refers to the informal public sphere, is meant to offer an account of a political debate in which the participants are conceived of as citizens on whom has been bestowed the right to equal political participation ‘which guarantees that the addressees of the laws can also understand themselves as the authors of these laws’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 13).</p>
<p>We already know, from the response to the second objection, that the protection the liberal state grants to religion in the form of the right to religious freedom is closely related to its relevant cognitive and moral substance that the liberal state is interested in preserving as an important element of social and public life. Thus, taking into account this premise, it is clear that the Radical Atheist citizens, as described in our example, aim to exclude their fellow religious citizens from the discussion; a group of citizens that might be able to offer relevant contributions for many discussions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a secularistic citizen with a secularistic perspective in the public sphere reveals herself to be not ‘critically alert to self-deception as well as hermeneutically open and sensitive’ to how her fellow religious citizens understand the world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0191453713491264">24</xref>
</sup> Thus, the nature itself of the political argumentation between citizens also justifies the exclusion of secularistic perspectives from those debates. As Habermas puts it, ‘For all their ongoing dissent on questions of worldviews and religious doctrines, citizens are meant to respect one another as free and equal members of their political community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 13). For this reason, the ethics of citizenship imposes a moral duty that ‘involves a willingness to listen to others and a fair-mindedness in deciding when accommodations to their views should reasonably be made’ (ibid.). Thus, while the religious arguments might contain important information and relevant contributions, a secularistic public perspective aims only to reject a great amount of citizens who can present those relevant contributions.</p>
<p>Lafont’s goal does not seem to be the defense of a dogmatic and fiery Radical Atheist who thinks her cognitive perspective gives her the right to misbehave in public discussions. In her own proposal she does not seem to agree either with a secularist who rejects a priori the claims of a religious citizen. However, she does seem to think that a citizen who believes that religions are particularly dangerous holdovers that should be openly combated is able to fulfill her obligation of providing counter-argument for religious claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 249). She explicitly affirms that even recalcitrant secularists might be able to do it. For Lafont, the secularistic perspective of such a citizen would not make any meaningful difference to her capacity to meet her political obligations as a democratic citizen (ibid.).</p>
<p>In this sense, Lafont’s secularistic citizen would not respond to the Leviticus argument by saying that her fellow citizen should not be heard at all for having a deceived consciousness. Similarly, she would not encourage her other fellow citizens to ignore such argument for being offered in a language produced by a dangerous holdover that should be fiercely combated. Lafont explicitly states that her secularistic citizen would, in contrast, object to the unequal treatment involved in denying the right to marriage to a group of citizens or appeal to anti-discrimination laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 142). But this is tantamount to refraining from a public use of secularism, which is precisely what Habermas’ perspective proposes.</p>
<p>At least to a certain degree, Lafont’s secularistic citizen has to distance herself from her secularism in order to be able to find the motivation for offering those arguments, instead of just offering the most sincere argument she has and believes in, namely, that religion is the opiate of the people and that a person under the effect of such ‘substance’ should not be listened to. It is difficult to believe that a citizen who ‘goes’ to the debates in the public sphere with such beliefs will be able to take seriously her fellow religious citizens as potentially reasonable contributors, since she clearly and undoubtedly strikes them down from the beginning for using religious language, language that, for Habermas, has a powerful semantic content that can make relevant contributions to public discussions.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are certain arguments that do not seem to belong to the public sphere. Clearly, Lafont’s right to include in public political debates any perspective or argument one honestly believes is not posited without limits. Indeed, for Lafont herself such a right has to be combined with the ‘need to secure reasons acceptable to everyone for the coercive political decisions with which all citizens must comply’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 141).</p>
<p>There are easy cases of cognitive stances not protected by such a right. If we wanted to accept Lafont’s proposal, we would have to affirm that some cognitive stances simply do not secure reasons acceptable to everyone. For instance, a citizen should not be entitled to a cognitive belief according to which she can refuse to listen to a person for reasons related to her race, gender, age, social origin, etc. To be sure, no truly democratic citizen would be entitled to offer a counter-argument according to which one of her fellow citizens’ reasons are mistaken because she is a woman, or because she is an immigrant. In this sense Lafont’s right does not protect racist cognitive stances insofar as they are not the beliefs that a democratic citizen would hold.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0191453713491264">25</xref>
</sup> Similarly, if we look at her examples, Lafont does not want to protect either the possibility of being able to offer an argument like the following: ‘Your religious argument cannot be accepted because it is religious.’ She is more interested in arguments with the following structure: ‘Your religious argument cannot be accepted because it contradicts the principle of equality established in our constitution.’</p>
<p>But such a secular citizen, as it was shown before, has to accept at least the presentation of the religious argument. In this sense, the secularistic citizens would have to accept that religious arguments are allowed in the public sphere. If sincerity were her only motivation, a secularistic citizen who thought that religions are dangerous holdovers that should be openly combated would only offer the following answer to a religious argument: ‘You have a deceived consciousness.’</p>
<p>Thus, her radical secularism, even for Lafont, must be partially affected by her participation in the debate and the acceptance of the presentation of religious arguments. However, if religious arguments are accepted, it is because those arguments constitute potentially relevant contributions offered by other citizens. Once a religious argument is accepted in the public sphere it means that religious conceptions of the world might have some potential for truth and that citizens can make contributions to public debates phrased in religious language. Therefore, all the citizens participating in the debate have the duty of listening, and, if possible, even the duty of attempting to translate the valuable semantic content of the religious argument into a language accessible to all citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006b</xref>: 260).</p>
<p>Now, does this mean that Habermas’ rejection of a public secularism requires the acceptance of a private one? Does this mean that Habermas is encouraging citizens to be hypocrites who do not affirm in public what they really think in private? I think that on this issue it is crucial to highlight that what is at stake is an ethics of citizenship. A secularistic citizen might have to split her mind, but how she does it is entirely up to her. An easy way to do it is to reject secularism. But, offering an account of this process is not the job for an ethics of citizenship; an ethics that is ultimately interested, not in personal mind-sets, but in the public utterances that citizens actually express for the legitimizing power of democratic discourses. In this sense, ultimately Lafont agrees with Habermas in that, at least in the public sphere, the secularistic citizen has to restrain her own secularism. As Lafont herself puts it, ‘There is no cognitive dishonesty involved in being exposed to the arguments of our fellow citizens or in being obliged to make our own arguments good by appeal to arguments that other citizens can reasonably accept’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 252). Thus, the secularist citizen, in her role of citizen, is not being dishonest if she refrains from secularistic views that deny any value for religious discourses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0191453713491264">
<title>Objection four</title>
<p>The fourth objection to Habermas’ approach refers to the apparent silence from Habermas about citizens’ obligation when casting their votes. According to Lafont, there is not enough clarity in Habermas’ proposal on the central question of how citizens should act when casting their votes. For Lafont, Habermas seems to be accepting that religious citizens may ‘cast their votes on the basis of their religious convictions … However, it should be obvious that allowing a majority of religious citizens to cast their votes on fundamental political questions on the basis of exclusively religious reasons would directly undermine the central normative claim of Habermas’ approach, namely, that only secular reasons should count in determining coercive political decisions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 140).</p>
<p>Lafont’s fourth objection deserves a deep analysis insofar as it points out that the frontier dividing the formal public sphere and the informal is, to say the least, porous, especially when discussing religion’s role. Habermas, to be sure, is not unaware of this. Indeed, he also raises the question ‘of the extent to which during an election campaign candidates may confess or even indicate that they are religious persons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2008</xref>: 128). In this sense, a complete response to this objection would take us to the ways in which the informal and the formal public sphere interact with each other in order to transform political power into public will. In this article, nonetheless, I do not have the space for fully developing a response in that direction.</p>
<p>I do want to indicate, anyway, that Habermas has a good reason for not considering voting as an important issue. As he puts it:
<disp-quote>
<p>What is illegitimate is of course not the majority vote, assuming it has been correctly carried out, but the violation of the other core component of the procedure, namely the discursive nature of the deliberations preceding the vote … Majority rule turns into repression if the majority deploys religious arguments in the process of political opinion and will formation and refuses to offer those publicly accessible justifications which the losing minority, be it secular or of a different faith, is able to follow and to evaluate in the light of shared standards. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think that Lafont’s disagreement with Habermas is based on the place she assigns to sincerity for assessing public discussions. Going back to our example, we could think that the religious citizen who proposed the poll did it because she knew that, numerically, there are more Radical Religious and Soft Religious citizens than Soft Atheists and Radical Atheists. We could also think that she made her proposal with the hope that, ultimately, many of her fellow religious citizens, at the moment of voting, would say: ‘OK, I like equality, and I said in the debate that I respected it, but, sorry, I am a good Catholic and the Church is opposed to same-sex marriages, so I vote negatively.’</p>
<p>Doubtless, this is something that can happen in reality. However, as Habermas indicates: 
<disp-quote>
<p>… the link between the actual motivation for a citizen’s actions and those reasons he cites in public may be relevant for a moral judgment of the citizen, but it has no import for assessing his contribution to maintaining a liberal political culture. For in the final analysis, only the manifest reasons have institutional implications for the formation of majorities and decision-making within the relevant political bodies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2008</xref>: 126)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p> Thus, the voting objection is compelling as long as one emphasizes sincerity as a crucial element that defines the ethics of citizenship. However, if, as Habermas sees it, what is important for the legitimizing power of democratic discourses is not mind-sets but actual contributions to the formation of opinions and consensus-building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2011</xref>: 33), then at the end of the day one can only hope that, when facing the ballots, a religious democratic citizen would integrate within her religious world-view the requirements of the liberal state.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0191453713491264">
<title>Objection five</title>
<p>Lafont’s last objection is that, at the end of the day, Habermas’ proposal can only be applied in societies less pluralistic than the actual existing ones; societies in which Radical Religious and Radical Atheist citizens do not exist.</p>
<p>The response to this fifth objection might have two faces. On the one hand, it could simply be said that Habermas is developing a normative-philosophical approach on how citizens should act. Nonetheless, I do not think that Lafont is pointing to this with her objection. But, she does affirm that ‘Certainly, no one would deny that if citizens’ cognitive stances were to become similar enough the problem of political integration would eventually disappear. But, it can hardly count as a way to solve the problem of political integration under conditions of pluralism to simply hope that the problem evaporates if and when some extremes of the spectrum disappear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 147). In this sense, Lafont’s criticism seems to be motivated by a defense of pluralism. Nonetheless, it is true that, from Habermas’ proposal, some of the Radical Religious citizens and Radical Atheist citizens cannot be truly democratic citizens if they maintain their cognitive stances and make use of them in public debates. However, Radical Atheist citizens willing to doubt their own secularism as well as Radical Religious citizens able to integrate egalitarianism into their religious doctrines are in a very different position.</p>
<p>Second, as it was mentioned in the response to Lafont’s third objection, it is not clear what Lafont means when she posits the right of all democratic citizens to take their own cognitive stance in public deliberations. In a deliberative democracy, as Lafont herself acknowledges, this right would have to be coherent with the duties of a democratic citizen; duties that, as Habermas has indicated, affect the cognitive stances that such a citizen is allowed to have. In Lafont’s words:
<disp-quote>
<p>Although democratic societies may in fact contain citizens who do not endorse democratic political values, only if a majority of citizens endorses them can a democratic regime be sustained in the long run. It is against the background of that aim that an account of the moral obligations of democratic citizenship makes sense. Since citizens who reject democratic political values would equally reject any democratic obligation to provide reasons acceptable to other citizens for coercive policies to which all must comply, they are beyond the reach of any account of the moral obligations of <italic>democratic </italic>citizenship that make public justification possible. For better or for worse, an account of the democratic obligations of citizenship can only reach democratic citizens. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 145–6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hence, although it is true that, as Lafont says, ‘politics is the realm of the here and now’ (2009: 140), it is also true that Habermas is developing a normative approach directed to those citizens willing to be democratic and, thus, willing to live in the United States of Deliberative Democracies. And this, according to Habermas, requires cognitive preconditions that all citizens (religious and non-religious) must fulfill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 18).</p>
<p>No democratic citizen is entitled to a cognitive belief according to which the arguments provided in a public debate by a dark-skinned female citizen do not have, from the beginning, the same weight as the arguments of other citizens. In this sense, a democratic state demands that its citizens be open-minded enough to hear the reasons and arguments of other fellow citizens without denying them any possible value, validity, or truthfulness. Although the reasons are different, Habermas’ account of the role of religion in the public sphere highlights that just as a democratic citizen cannot have the right to affirm in a public debate: ‘I do not have to listen to your arguments because you are black’ (or a woman, or poor, or liberal, or immigrant, etc.), that very same democratic citizen cannot have the right, either, to affirm in a public debate: ‘I do not have to listen to your arguments because you can only formulate them in a religious language.’</p>

<sec id="section14-0191453713491264">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Lafont acknowledges that ‘Religious citizens cannot justify the policies they favor on the basis of exclusively religious claims and reasons simply because they live in societies with secular citizens and citizens of conflicting faiths’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 252). According to Habermas, religious citizens can formulate their arguments in a religious language, but they do it knowing that they are constrained by their previous acceptance of the constitution of the secular state. Likewise, secular citizens cannot entirely rule out religious arguments from the informal public sphere because they live in societies with religious citizens of very different and diverse faiths, who are protected, in a form of a legal right, by that very same secular constitution.</p>
<p>In this sense, Habermas’ proposal on the role of religion in the public sphere implies a great advantage that must be highlighted. Indeed, Habermas’ account does not aim to distinguish between rational religious doctrines and irrational ones. For him, ‘in the final instance it is the faith and practice of the religious community that decide whether a dogmatic processing of the cognitive challenges of modernity has been “successful” or not; only then can believers accept it as a “learning process”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2008</xref>: 138). Nonetheless, Habermas’ proposal also clarifies that, from the perspective of the constitution of the liberal state, religious doctrines will indeed be differentiated on the basis of whether or not they cope with the fact of pluralism, with the public authority of the sciences, and with the egalitarianism of our constitutional principles. But, in addition, from the very same perspective of the liberal state, it is expected that secular citizens will draw such distinction as well.</p>
<p>At first sight, the public debates about same-sex marriages would not seem to constitute a good case for emphasizing the positive aspects of religious doctrines for a deliberative democracy. However, with my example I tried to show that religious doctrines are so diverse and complex that even within the seemingly negative role that they play in the debates about same-sex marriages, the door must be left opened for the introduction of other kinds of religious arguments that point at a different direction. Be that as it may, I think that the example of a public debate about same-sex marriage was useful to show that Habermas’ approach does not represent a blind defense of religion.</p>
<p>Although I do not think that Lafont’s objections are as strong as she claimed them to be, her critiques do constitute useful indicators of Habermas’ strong presuppositions on which his account of the role of religion in the public sphere is based. In rejecting Lafont’s objections I do not want to suggest that Habermas’ perspective is flawless. Nonetheless, I think that Habermas’ flaws and problems are to be found within the philosophical bases on which his account rests. I would like to end my article by indicating what I regard as the most important conceptual presuppositions of Habermas’ account. I want to present the following remarks as preliminary reflections that might be helpful at developing a more thorough and systematic critique of Habermas’ account of the role of religion in the public sphere.</p>
<p>First, as the response to Lafont’s objections revealed, Habermas is presupposing an account of what religion is and why it is a very special and unique comprehensive doctrine. According to Lafont, Habermas’ participation in the debate about the role of religion in the public sphere seems surprising ‘since religion has rarely been foregrounded in his work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 239). Nevertheless, already in his doctoral dissertation, religion was a theme of reflection for Habermas. Moreover, according to Habermas himself, his interest on religion is something that he has never truly abandoned:
<disp-quote>
<p>I would not object to the claim that my conception of language and of communicative action oriented toward mutual understanding nourishes itself from the legacy of Christianity. The ‘telos of reaching understanding’ … may well nourish itself from the heritage of a <italic>logos </italic>understood as Christian, one that is indeed embodied … in the communicative practice of the religious congregation. Already the communicative-theoretical version of the concept of emancipation in <italic>Knowledge and Human Interest </italic>could be ‘unmasked’ as the secularizing translation of the divine promise of salvation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2002</xref>: 160)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It should be analysed nonetheless, to what extent Habermas’ perspective on religion has substantially changed in his most recent works. In addition, it is fair to wonder whether or not his new view of religion is coherent with the rest of his system of communicative rationality.</p>
<p>Second, it is noteworthy that Habermas claims to be developing a post-metaphysical approach to religion. According to him, this type of approach is able to enter into dialogue with religious doctrines. I think that in order to assess Habermas’ perspective on religion we must bear in mind its alleged post-metaphysical character. In this sense, his account of the role of religion in the public sphere is based on a premise that cannot go unnoticed, namely, that only a post-metaphysical philosophy is able to understand the post-secular character of the current world society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0191453713491264">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For Habermas, post-metaphysical thinking expresses the kind of cognitive attitude that secular citizens must develop in order to fully respect their fellow religious citizens and learn from their contributions to public debates. In his words, ‘the secular awareness that one is living in a post-secular society finds expression at the philosophical level in a post-metaphysical mode of thought’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2008</xref>: 119). It remains to be analysed, among other issues, to what extent what Habermas means by this is that all secular citizens have to be post-metaphysical thinkers in order to be democratic.</p>
<p>Third, Habermas’ latest interest in religion is based on a political perspective of a deliberative democracy. In this sense, there exists a deep relationship between Habermas’ approach to religion and his democratic attempt to find a new meaning for the concept of ‘the political’. Indeed, Habermas’ ‘revival’ of ‘the political’ implies that religion cannot be considered as something necessarily anti-Enlightenment or anti-modernity. Religion, actually, should be considered as an authentic source of ‘salvation’ for the motivational deficit largely found within the liberal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2011</xref>). For Habermas, simply put, citizens are being rendered powerless by the economic and administrative subsystems, and one way to oppose that process is by their self-empowerment as truly politically committed agents who maintain a normative perspective according to which ‘something better is still available to get’. Regarding this aspect, nonetheless, it is at least counter-intuitive that the salvation for democracy has to be found in religious communities, communities whose structure has not been historically characterized by their democratic shape.</p>
<p>Finally, as properly noted by Lafont, the notion itself of modernity is also at stake, or, in other words, a reflexive self-understanding of modernity and the role religion plays within such self-understanding. In Habermas’ words, ‘The controversy also extends to the epistemological question of the relationship between faith and knowledge, which itself impinges upon key elements of the background understanding of modernity. Interestingly enough, both the philosophical and the theological efforts to define the relationship between faith and knowledge in a self-reflexive manner throw up far-reaching questions concerning the genealogy of modernity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2008</xref>: 145). Thus, although Habermas’ proposal refers to deliberative democracies, its context is also the current emergence of a world society and a global public sphere that affects the type of consciousness and the degree of self-reflexivity expected of democratic citizens.</p>

<p>Habermas’ main text on the subject is ‘Religion in the Public Sphere’ published in 2006 in the <italic>European Journal of Philosophy</italic>. There is another version of the text published a year before in <italic>Zwischen Naturalismus und Religion</italic>. The English translation of this latter text is ‘Religion in the Public Sphere: Cognitive Presuppositions for the “Public Use of Reason” by Religious and Secular Citizens’.

<p>Habermas distinguishes between ‘secular’ and ‘secularist’. In his own words:<disp-quote>
<p>I make a terminological distinction between ‘secular’ and ‘secularist’. Unlike the neutral stance of a secular or unbelieving person who regards religious validity claims agnostically, secularists adopt a polemical stance towards religious doctrines which retain a certain public influence even though their claims cannot be scientifically justified. Today secularism often appeals to a ‘hard’, that is, scientifically grounded, version of naturalism. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2009</xref>: 74)</p>
</disp-quote>In <italic>Between Naturalism and Religion </italic>Habermas had already stated that ‘The secularism of the scientific worldview insists that the archaic ways of thinking of religious doctrines have been completely overtaken and made redundant by the advances in knowledge of established research’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2008</xref>: 5). </p>

<p>For Lafont the most obvious virtue of Habermas’ proposal is that it does not demand self-restraint from religious citizens for the kind of arguments they can provide in the deliberative agenda of the informal public sphere. Nevertheless, Lafont acknowledges that Habermas does not emphasize this aspect. For her, though, such absence of self-restraint is an essential feature of any credible account of deliberative democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 244–5). </p>

<p>Throughout her texts Lafont raises several objections against Habermas’ perspective. However, the objections that she really develops are the ones related to the basis of her own proposal. I think, nonetheless, that each one of Lafont’s objections points to crucial elements of Habermas’ account that need to be analysed more carefully. In this sense I will try to derive from Lafont’s own texts objections that perhaps are presented by her only as problematic questions. </p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0191453713491264">
<label>6.</label>
<p>It is well known that citizens’ perspective on same-sex marriage is highly influenced by their religion. According to the <italic>2010 Annual Religion and Public Life Survey</italic> conducted by Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press and the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life 35% of citizens admit that religion is the top influence on their thinking about same-sex marriage. One of the conclusions of the poll survey was that ‘In contrast with many other social and political issues, religion is clearly an important influence on public opinion about same-sex marriage and abortion. Significant numbers of Americans report that religion is the most important factor in their thinking about these topics, and sizeable numbers of churchgoers hear about them from their clergy.’ See: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/Few-Say-Religion-Shapes-Immigration-Environment-Views.aspx#3">http://pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/Few-Say-Religion-Shapes-Immigration-Environment-Views.aspx#3</ext-link></p>

<label>7.</label>
<p>To be sure, Lafont also demands a justification from Habermas regarding his idea that, in order to be rational and democratic, a religious citizen must accept the authority of scientific knowledge. In Lafont’s words: 
<disp-quote>
<p>In general, I find Habermas’ diagnosis of the changes in mentality required of religious and secular citizens in a post-secular society highly problematic. Being a secular citizen myself, I certainly would welcome the acceptance of the authority of scientific knowledge by everyone, religious citizens included. From an <italic>epistemic </italic>point of view, I do not see any rational alternative. But, even so, I fail to see how this could suffice to justify the quite different claim that accepting the authority of science is a precondition for fulfilling the normative expectations of democratic citizenship. Habermas nowhere provides a substantive justification of this claim, though one seems urgently needed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 146)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0191453713491264">
<label>8.</label>
<p>In her proposal, Lafont highlights the existence of arguments to which every citizen, whether secular or religious, is obliged to respond. Let us suppose that a Soft Religious citizen argues that the law should be accepted in virtue of the intrinsic value of homosexual life-styles. To be sure, this citizen is absolutely entitled to offer her argument. However, it is an argument to which other citizens may not feel compelled to respond. However, if the argument in favor of same-sex marriage is similar to the ones mentioned before, namely, arguments about the political value of equal treatment to all citizens, this argument does need to be answered by the religious citizens that oppose same-sex marriage. In this case, they have to explain why their opposition does not imply an institutionalizing of a second-class citizenship for same-sex couples.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0191453713491264">
<label>9.</label>
<p>As I said before, Lafont’s ‘mediator interpretation’ is not completely inaccurate since Habermas himself affirms that his conception ‘<italic>mediates</italic> between the two sides’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2008</xref>: 119; emphases added) of the debate. Based on her ‘mediator interpretation’ Lafont raises what could be a sixth objection to Habermas’ account, namely, his unjustified commitment with equal distribution or symmetry as a criterion for assessing the cognitive burdens of both secular and religious citizens. At many moments, according to Lafont, it seems that political fairness constitutes Habermas’ rationale for allowing religious citizens to offer exclusively religious arguments in the discussions within the informal public sphere. Once again, Lafont is not completely groundless in pointing out Habermas’ commitment with symmetry. Indeed, Habermas recurrently shows that his proposal is strongly committed to it. In Habermas’ own words: ‘what interests me is the unanswered question whether the revised concept of citizenship that I have proposed in fact imposes an <italic>asymmetrical burden</italic> on religious traditions and religious communities after all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>:14; emphasis added). Also, right after presenting his controversial burdens on secular citizens, he states: ‘This requirement of translation must be conceived as a cooperative task in which the non-religious citizens must likewise participate, if their religious fellow citizens are not to be encumbered with an <italic>asymmetrical burden</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas 2006a</xref>:11; emphasis added). Finally, at the end of his text, Habermas concludes:
<disp-quote>
<p>The required work of philosophical reconstruction goes to show that the ethics of democratic citizenship assumes secular citizens exhibit a mentality that is no less demanding than the corresponding mentality of their religious counterparts. This is why the cognitive burdens that both sides have to shoulder in order to acquire the appropriate epistemic attitudes are by no means <italic>asymmetrically distributed</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>:18; emphasis added) </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Lafont, nonetheless, as long as the cognitive burdens are well justified, it is not clear at all why, in addition, they have to be symmetrically distributed. As she puts it:
<disp-quote>
<p>Thus it may well be that the cognitive burdens democracy imposes on different citizens actually are not symmetrical. However, <italic>to the same extent that cognitive stances cannot be chosen or prescribed from the outside</italic>,<italic> it makes no sense to think that the consequences of adopting them can be regulated through a fair distribution of cognitive burdens</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 253) </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Briefly put, this sixth objection would indicate that symmetry cannot be taken as a criterion to develop a proper account of the ethics of citizenship. In Lafont’s words:
<disp-quote>
<p>… there is no a priori guarantee that the request for symmetrical distribution of cognitive burdens among citizens will be compatible with the discursive conditions necessary for a meaningful process of political opinion- and willformation through collective deliberation in the public sphere. Given that such conditions, whatever they turn out to be, must have priority in a discourse account of the ethics of democratic citizenship, if a deliberative democracy is to be possible at all, the discourse approach must leave open the question of whether or not the cognitive burdens that derive from such conditions turn out to be symmetrically distributed among citizens. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2007</xref>: 259) </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although I will not deepen this line of argumentation, I must admit that I too regard as misleading Habermas’ references to symmetry.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-0191453713491264">
<label>10.</label>
<p>Perhaps an argument from a secularistic perspective might imply a radical naturalistic view. In this sense, then, a Radical Atheist might affirm that homosexuality is simply a by-product of evolution. He could use as proof for his argument some of the researches that document ‘similar’ behaviors in other species. One of the most recent cases that received the attention of the media refers to the Laysan albatross, <italic>Phoebastria immutabilis</italic> (see Lindsay C. Young, Brenda J. Zaun and Eric A. VanderWerf, ‘Successful Same-sex Pairing in Laysan Albatross’, <italic>Biol Lett</italic>. 4(4) (23 August 2008): 323–5). Bruce Bagemihl's book <italic>Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity</italic> (New York: St Martin's Press, 1999) is commonly quoted for stating that various forms of same-sex sexual activity have been observed in more than 450 different species of animals. In this sense the argument is the following: if homosexual behavior occurs in animals, then it means that it is something natural. Therefore, since such behavior does occur in many other animals, homosexuality should be accepted and the rights of same-sex couples should be protected. Human beings, at the end of day, are just another kind of animal and not the rulers of creation like many religious doctrines suggest (‘<italic>Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground</italic>’ [Genesis 1:26]). But if this kind of argument is radicalized we might be now in terrain in which it might presuppose the idea that every human sphere (sexuality included) must be interpreted <italic>only </italic>from a biological and evolutionary perspective, In this sense, any religious counter-argument is seen as an unnecessary and false moral perspective introduced into what can and should be interpreted exclusively in naturalistic terms. Now, expressed like this the argument reveals its radical scientistic character. And, in this sense, as Boettcher indicates, ‘At least in their role as citizens, the non-religious must also be able to distinguish science from scientism and related forms of philosophical naturalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0191453713491264">Boettcher, 2009</xref>: 232). In Habermas’ words: 
<disp-quote>
<p>Scientism often misleads us into blurring the boundary between natural scientific knowledge which is relevant for understanding ourselves and our place in nature as a whole, on the one hand, and a synthetic naturalistic worldview constructed on this basis, on the other. This form of radical naturalism devalues all types of statements that cannot be traced back to empirical observations, statements of laws, or causal explanations, hence moral, legal, and evaluative statements no less than religious ones. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2008</xref>: 141) </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly:
<disp-quote>
<p>In theoretical controversies, scientific specialization is sufficient to pre-empt the practical lifeworld conflicts that erupt in religious disputes because religious truths have immediate relevance for the personal conduct of one’s life. Scientists are drawn into such conflicts only when the practice of research promises to have implications for the ethical self-understanding of persons beyond the domain of research … As it happens, this shows that a naturalism based on a synthetic treatment of scientific information is itself a worldview and is situated on the same level as religious interpretations as far as the relevance of knowledge for ethical action goes.

<p>We could say that such a citizen belongs to one of the religious communities that have actually supported, in one way or another, same-sex marriage, namely, the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, or the United Church of Christ. In 2006 the Episcopal Church stated its ‘support of gay and lesbian persons and [opposition to] any state or federal constitutional amendment’ prohibiting same-sex marriages or civil unions (Resolution A095). Although the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America defines marriage as a lifelong covenant of faithfulness ‘between a man and a woman’, in August 2009 it adopted a social statement on human sexuality that supports a broad diversity of families, including those constituted by same-gender couples. Similarly, in 1996, the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations adopted a resolution in support of same-sex marriage. Finally, in 2005, the United Church of Christ’s General Synod voted to legally recognize and advocate in favor of same-sex marriage. See Religious Groups' Official Positions on Same-Sex Marriage ANALYSIS 27 July 2010, @: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pewforum.org/Gay-Marriage-and-Homosexuality/Religious-Groups-Official-Positions-on-Same-Sex-Marriage.aspx">http://pewforum.org/Gay-Marriage-and-Homosexuality/Religious-Groups-Official-Positions-on-Same-Sex-Marriage.aspx</ext-link>

<p>Within Judaism there are Orthodox movements that do not sanctify same-sex union but there are as well Reform and Reconstructionist Jewish movements that do support gay and lesbian rights, including same-sex marriage. A common position of all these religious movements is to ‘allow congregations that choose to do so to recognize, support and hold publicly accountable lifelong, monogamous, same-gender relationships’ (ibid.).</p>

<p>Luke 10:25–37:
<disp-quote>
<p>Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, ‘Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?’ He said to him, ‘What is written in the law? How do you read it?’ He answered, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.’ He said to him, ‘You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.’ But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, ‘Who is my neighbor?’ Jesus answered, ‘A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, “Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.” Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?’ He said, ‘He who showed mercy on him.’ Then Jesus said to him, ‘Go and do likewise.’ In many contemporary interpretations of the parable it goes unnoticed that the relationship between the Jews and Samaritans was one of hostility. Nonetheless, for the religious citizen of our example the conflict between Jews and Samaritans is an essential context on which the parable must be read. </p>

<p>See Rajeev <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0191453713491264">Bhargava (2010</xref>). According to the Pew Forum US Religious Landscape Survey, conducted in 2007, among mainline Protestants overall, 56% think homosexuality should be accepted. A new poll conducted in 2010 shows that 31% of all Protestants support gay marriage, while 59% are opposed. In contrast, 46% of all Catholics are in favor and 42% are opposed. Of the Jewish,, 76% are in favor, and 18% are against it. Finally, ‘roughly six-in-ten of the religiously unaffiliated (61%) favor same-sex marriage, including fully 78% of atheists and agnostics and 54% of those who say their religion is “nothing in particular”’.</p>

<p>In ‘Religion in the Public Sphere’ Habermas makes the same claim by saying that ‘the liberal state … must not discourage religious persons and communities from also expressing themselves politically as such, for it cannot know whether secular society would not otherwise cut itself off from key resources for the creation of meaning and identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2006a</xref>: 10).</p>

<p>In the interview ‘A Conversation About God and The World’, published in 2002 in <italic>Religion and Rationality, </italic>Eduardo Mendieta asked Habermas the following: ‘Is it your view that it is philosophy’s goal to completely assimilate, to translate, to rework and to “sublate” all desirable religious content? Or do you expect that religion will forever resist all efforts at such an intervention – and that it thus always will remain unassimilable and inaccessible, and in a certain sense thus also autonomous and unavoidable?’ Habermas’ answer was: ‘I don’t know.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2002</xref>: 163).</p>

<p>This was one of the deepest disagreements between Habermas and Taylor in the panel ‘Rethinking Secularism: The Power of Religion in the Public Sphere’ hosted in fall 2009 by the NYU's Institute for Public Knowledge, the Social Science Research Council and Stony Brook University. For Taylor, religion is simply one instance of many sorts of comprehensive views of the good. In contrast, for Habermas, religion is a very special case. As he puts it, ‘the evidence for religious reasons does not only depend on cognitive beliefs and their semantic nexus with other beliefs, but on existential beliefs that are rooted in the social dimension of membership, socialization, and prescribed practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2011</xref>: 62. It seems to me that Lafont’s reluctance to engage Habermas’ thoughts on religion might presuppose her agreement with Taylor’s perspective. </p>

<p>In this same interview Habermas recognizes, nonetheless, that his criticism, directed against the laicist understanding of the separation of state and church, can be regarded as a European view. For Habermas, in the United States, where ‘the President publicly prays in office, the criticism that orients itself by the same principles should aim in the opposite political direction. In my view, positions that do not wish to subject the political influence of religious voices to formal constraints blur the limits without which a secular state cannot maintain its impartiality.’ Furthermore, Habermas even admits that ‘the political cultures are already so different between our Western societies that the universal principles for the public role of religion – in general, for what we in the West call the “separation of church and state” – would have to be specified and institutionalized differently in each local context’.</p>

<p>For Lafont, ‘Whereas citizens may not feel compelled to address objections based, say, on the intrinsic value of homosexual life-styles or of cultural diversity, which they may not share, they must feel compelled to address objections based on the political value of equal treatment that they do share as democratic citizens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 142).</p>

<p>In Habermas’ words: ‘After all, the conflict between one’s own religious convictions and secularly justified policies or proposed laws can only arise because even the religious citizen is already supposed to have accepted the constitution of the secular state for good reasons. He no longer lives as a member of a religiously homogeneous population within a religiously legitimated state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713491264">Habermas, 2008</xref>: 129).</p>

<p>In this sense, the question that seems to define Lafont's proposal is the following: ‘[I]s it at all possible to organize public deliberation in such a way that none of the tasks involved require democratic citizens to adopt a disingenuous cognitive stance, while at the same time meeting the liberal criterion of democratic legitimacy? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491264">Lafont, 2009</xref>: 141).</p>

<label>24.</label>
<p>In a certain way, Habermas’ perspective is related to Kant’s duty to respect every human being in the logical use of reason. For Kant, such duty must be thought of as
<disp-quote>
<p>… a duty not to censure his error by calling them absurdities, poor judgment and so forth, but rather to suppose that his judgment must yet contain some truth and to seek this out, uncovering, at the same time, the deceptive illusion (the subjective ground that determined his judgment which, by an oversight, he took for objective), and so, by explaining to him the possibility of his having erred, to preserve his respect for his own understanding. For if, by using such expressions, one denies any understanding to someone who opposes one in a certain judgment, how does one want to bring him to understand that he has erred? (2009: 6:463)</p>

</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn25-0191453713491264">
<label>25.</label>
<p>Lafont offers two slightly different formulations of this right. First, she formulates it as the right to <italic>include </italic>in public political debate whatever views and reasons one honestly believes. But, second, she also refers to <italic>the right of all democratic citizens to take their own cognitive stance in public deliberation. </italic>It is noteworthy that in the second formulation the adjective ‘democratic’ might work as a filter for excluding certain cognitive stances. If a citizen would say, for instance, ‘Your argument is not strong because you are a woman’, one could say that such cognitive stance is not one that a democratic citizen would hold. In the first case, there does not seem any filter and every cognitive stance would seem to be allowed, even if it were discriminatory or degrading. Although Lafont is ambiguous in this aspect, the examples she offers as acceptable arguments seem to indicate that she is referring to the second case. </p>

<p>For Habermas, philosophy needs to leave behind its ‘metaphysical past’ in order to develop an appropriate understanding of its coexistence with religious practice. Philosophy should not overstep its own boundaries by conceiving of itself as a replacement of religion.</p>
