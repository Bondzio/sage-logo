<italic>How the United States Racializes Latinos</italic> submits a compelling narrative for understanding the processes by which immigrant groups, particularly those from Latin America and the Caribbean, become stigmatized in the contemporary era of vigilant nativism. The book is a collection of intriguing and timely analyses into the experiences of the many different immigrant groups homogenized in the American lexicon as Hispanics. The book chapters taken as a whole aim to dissect two sociological riddles. The first issue concerns the concept of race versus ethnicity. The authors here elaborate on the concept of racialization to reveal how the traditional cultural understanding of the ethnic Hispanic label fails to accurately account for or sufficiently document the many Latino/Latina lives that fall under the Hispanic label. The second issue speaks to the White–non-White racial hierarchy. The individual chapters reveal how the process of racialization sustains a White hegemonic social structure that reigns over Latino/Latina lives. By racialization the authors mean, “the centuries-old white racial frame—a white generated worldview in which Latinos and Latin Americans appear as an inferior ‘race’” (p. 12). The rigid dualism of White–non-White at the roots of the hierarchical pattern of social vision and division that erected White domination in the United States always included within it the racialization of Latino/Latinas, either via Imperial conquest throughout the Americas and Caribbean or in the everyday interactions of racial domination inside the United States.</p>
<p>In the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau, 15% of the American population Latino/Latinas for the first time surpassed African Americans as the largest ethnoracial minority. The announcement by the U.S. Census Bureau of this demographic shift resonated across the media and left an indelible mark on public life. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2153368712460766">2004</xref>, Samuel Huntington published his nativist exclamation warning of the threats to American sovereignty caused by Latino/Latina migration into the United States. In Huntington’s view, Latino/Latinas pose a threat to Anglo institutions because Latino/Latinas grant too much value to their native Spanish tongue, whereas earlier immigrants from Europe readily accepted English as their primary language. Further, in Huntington’s lament, the growing Latino/Latina population within the United States poses a threat to national unity, summed up in his assertion that Hispanic immigrants never fully commit to American patriotism as a result of their relative close proximity to Latin America and the Caribbean. Many of the chapters in <italic>How the United States Racializes Latinos</italic> offer a rebuttal to Huntington’s nativist cries. In Chapter 2, “Counting Latinos in the U.S. Census,” Clara Rodríguez documents the problems inherent in the U.S. Census Bureau’s calculations. Chapter 4, “Repression and Resistance: The Lynchings of Persons of Mexican Origin in the United States, 1848-1928,” analyzes the hidden history of lynchings of persons of Mexican descent in traditional scholarship on lynchings, as well as in the collective memory of American publics. Chapters 9, “Racializing Miami,” and 10, “Blacks, Latinos, and the Immigration Debate” look at how immigrant and native populations negotiate collective Latino/Latina identity within a racial hierarchy that reproduces White domination, while challenging its logic at the same time. As a whole, these and other chapters in the book point to how America’s peculiar logic of racial domination is reproduced in the public discourses about Hispanic immigration and in the everyday interactions of groups classified as Latino/Latinas in the United States. Here, I examine the central arguments advanced in <italic>How the United States Racializes Latinos</italic>, concluding with a discussion of what these developments mean for criminological sociology and criminal justice institutions.</p>
<p>The official way of documenting race and ethnicity in the United States remains a bewildering mystery, particularly for Latino/Latinas who are left without any reasonable options in the official American ethnoracial classification system. For Clara Rodriguez, in Chapter 2, “Counting Latinos in the U.S. Census,” the way Latino/Latinas respond to the questions about race and ethnicity in the official U.S. Census survey reflects the diversity of opinion about what counts as race in America, which also highlights the nebulous traits of the dubious systems of classification that exist in the American imagination. A revealing deception of the American racial classification from Latino/Latinas perspective is its inability to imagine an option that resonates with the historical experiences of most Latino/Latinas mixed ethnic and racial backgrounds. All persons of Hispanic descent are required to identify with a prefabricated, government-approved race since the U.S. Census bureau dictates that the Hispanic label reflect only an ethnicity and not a race. Proposals to include Hispanic as a racial category were discussed prior to the 2000 U.S. Census. However, these discussions were tossed aside in defense of the status quo recognizing Hispanic as exclusively an ethnic option. Of the racial options, none fit well with the categories of classification that exist in most Latino/Latinas imaginations. Nearly half of all Hispanics choose the White racial option, since most Latino/Latinas understanding of race loosely translates as something more akin to skin color and class, rather than one’s real or perceived ancestral descent. The second common response is selecting the “Some Other Race” option, and then reporting one’s own nationality in the space next to other.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In the 2000 census, 47.9 percent of Latinos indicated they were white, 2 percent reported they were black, 1.2 percent said they were American Indian, and less than 1 percent said they were Asian, Native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander. A surprising 42.2 percent chose the “some other race” category and many of these wrote in the Latino descriptor, such as Mexican, Chicano, Puerto Rican or Boricua. (Rodriguez in <italic>How the United States Racializes Latinos</italic>, p. 43)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Moreover, although the 2000 U.S. Census allowed respondents to select more than one race, only 6.3% of Latinos chose the multiracial option, which is still significantly higher than the 2.4% for the United States as a whole, but even more importantly “far lower than the proportion of Latinos who chose ‘some other race’ category” (Rodriguez, p. 43) which over 40% of Latino/Latina respondents have steadily selected since the 1980s. The confusion attributed to Latino/Latinas inability to properly select the “correct” racial category stems from the grand refusal of the American state to recognize the social aspect of both race and ethnicity as illusions of our collective imagination. In other words, race and ethnicity do not exist as physical realities independent from one another. Moreover, race and ethnicity are not readily recognizable outside the American social–historical and cultural context.</p>
<p>For many causal observers of the place of Latino/Latinas in the U.S. ethnoracial classification system, the fact that an inordinate number of Latino/Latinas select the White option in the U.S. Census survey, as well as in public life, reflects Latino/Latinas’ refusal to join in solidarity with African Americans in rejecting White hegemony. For the authors in <italic>How the United States Racializes Latinos</italic>, the way Latino/Latinas are racialized as neither White nor Black, yet without official recognition is a social fact that needs to be explained. For more than a century, Mexicans’ experiences in the United States mirrored that of American Blacks: segregated from Whites, stripped of their cultural heritage, forced to adopt English as the language in their minds eye, and succumbed to embrace Anglo-American history as their own. Chapter 4 in <italic>How the United States Racializes Latinos</italic> reports on the overlooked and often ignored history of lynchings in America. Carrigan and Webb’s “Repression and Resistance: The Lynching of Persons of Mexican Origin in the United States, 1848-1928” reveals the tensions and contradictions of a state-run ethnoracial classification system that refuses to recognize Latino/Latinas a race, all while unmistakably subjugating that group through the debaucheries of extra-legal popular justice. For example, the <italic>Without Sanctuary</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2153368712460766">Allen, Lewis, Litwack, &amp; Als, 2000</xref>) exhibit, which appeared at the New York Historical Society in the summer of 2000, and later published in the book under same title, displayed many disturbing and graphic images of victims of public torture lynchings. However, the fact that Mexicans had also been targets of this type of organized racial violence remains hidden from most lynching historiography. Carrigan and Webb’s research in this chapter forces us to recognize that which stares us right in the face, the deceptive Black–White racial dichotomy in the American imagination forces us to misrecognize social facts as simply Black and White. Nothing more clearly illustrates the racialization of Latino/Latinas than the use of the extra-legal machinery of popular justice to subjugate, control, and terrorize Mexicans throughout the Southwestern United States. The authors reexamine the traditional historical record on lynchings and comb through old newspaper reports to reveal the extent to which lynchings of both Blacks and Mexicans is central to the story of Anglo westward expansion. This shared history of victimization through vigilante justice points to the one of the central processes by which ethnoracial groups are made in the defense of White domination.</p>
<p>Chapters 9 and 10 are two additional chapters worth noting here to further illustrate the ambiguities of Latino/Latinas in the American racial framework. Chapter 9 looks at the racialization of Miami by applying Bonilla-Silva’s concept of colorblind racism to examine how the native-born and immigrant status fit within the structures of White hegemony. Latino/Latinas in Miami learn how to internalize the dominant group’s language of equal opportunity combined with the suspicion of new immigrants in order to claim their space in the racialized hierarchy of the American social structure. While immigrants from the Caribbean and Latin America may bring with them racial ideologies that possess more nuance than the Anglo one-drop rule of hypodescent, once inside the United States the simplicity of the American racial common nonsense privileging Whiteness proves too powerful an elixir to resist. Chapter 10 explores possible multiracial coalition building centered on immigrant rights. The authors analyze joint efforts by African American organizations and immigrant rights groups in Los Angeles and Chicago during the spring of 2006 to shed light on the common plight of all disadvantaged minorities in the United States. The language of workers’ rights and human rights serves to build bridges in the quest to improve working conditions for all, while also joining in the struggle to dismantle the structures of White hegemony. The proimmigrant marches in Los Angeles and Chicago showed that African Americans, Latino/Latinas, and immigrant rights groups can refine the art of coalition building in their pursuit of common goals in a political, social, and economic climate that too often works to their disadvantage.</p>
<p>The important themes covered in <italic>How the United States Racializes Latinos</italic> are a refreshing resource for demystifying the ideology of the Black–White racial division. The shortsighted illogic of American racial ideology receives a sustained analysis and discussion in light of the growing scope and complexity of the Latino/Latina population in the United States. Anti-immigrant sentiment made its way across the states in April 2010 as Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070, then in June 2011 in the Beason-Hammon Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act. If there is one shortcoming to this book, it is in the missed opportunity to reflect upon how the racialization of Latino/Latinas is interwoven in the law and order politics of the penal state. There is little mention of how groups living under the ethnic Hispanic label become targets of hyperpolicing, how at the local and national level publics define safety and security as protection from the Hispanic other. As a whole, the chapters in <italic>How the United States Racializes Latinos</italic> serve as a good introduction to the trajectories of ethnoracial domination as experienced by groups lumped under the ethnic Hispanic label in the United States classification system.</p>
