<p>We know more about crime and the criminal justice system today than at any other period in American history. There is more research being conducted on the causes of criminal behavior and more attention paid to how the criminal justice system operates. In addition to academic attention, the media, politicians, and the public all pay at least intermittent attention to crime and criminal justice policy matters. Expenditures on criminal justice resources such as police and corrections are at an all-time high. Public debate about the efficacy of the death penalty, the drug war, and how to deal with illegal immigrants is ongoing, if inconclusive.</p>
<p>Yet despite all this time, attention, and money, the criminal justice system is widely acknowledged to be a mess. Well-documented concerns include wrongful convictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887403412437409">Garrett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403412437409">Leo, 2008</xref>), racial profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887403412437409">Glover, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887403412437409">Harris, 2002</xref>), prosecutorial misconduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887403412437409">Bach, 2009</xref>), and disparities in criminal sentencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887403412437409">Alexander, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887403412437409">Cole, 1999</xref>), among others. So what are we doing wrong? According to the late William Stuntz, plenty. In <italic>The Collapse of American Criminal Justice</italic>, Stuntz argues that the criminal justice system not only fails to control crime but also fails to do a satisfactory job of sorting out the innocent from the guilty. According to Stuntz, during the last half of the 20th century, the time when more attention was paid to crime and more resources were assigned to the criminal justice system, it nonetheless fell apart.</p>
<p>Stuntz’s book is the culmination of a distinguished career. He completed the book shortly before he died of cancer at the age of 52. At the time of his passing, he was a professor at Harvard Law School; before that he was a law professor at his alma mater, the University of Virginia, and a law clerk to Supreme Court justice Lewis Powell. He wrote a number of influential law review articles on a variety of criminal procedure–related topics and also contributed to media outlets such as the <italic>New York Times</italic> and <italic>The New Republic</italic>. He was widely regarded as one of, if not the, leading criminal procedure scholars in the country. He cannot easily be classified as a liberal or a conservative; his criticisms of the criminal justice system cross the typical dividing lines. He is both critical of the police and prosecutors and firm in his belief that Warren Court rulings on the exclusionary rule and interrogation procedures did more harm than good.</p>
<p>Stuntz’s explanation for the failure of the American criminal justice system is twofold: there is too much law and too little democracy. The increase in the number of laws has led to an increase in discretion—on the part of police, who can choose which laws to enforce and which wrongdoers to arrest, and on the part of prosecutors, who can choose what crime to charge and how many charges to file against a particular suspect.</p>
<p>At the same time that laws have proliferated, democratic institutions have changed. Stuntz claims that in the past law enforcement operated largely at the neighborhood level and police were accountable to their neighbors for whom they arrested, and prosecutors were elected by people who lived in the urban areas where crimes were most common. Today, however, police are less accountable to their neighbors and prosecutors are elected by people who live in the suburbs and thus have little incentive to pay attention to the concerns of those in the inner cities where law enforcement is concentrated and more criminal (and victims) are supposedly located. The result is that residents of crime-ridden neighborhoods have little political power over how laws are enforced and suspects prosecuted. As inner city neighborhoods are now largely populated by minorities and the suburbs by Whites, the result is racial discrimination in both the enforcement of the law and prosecution of offenders.</p>
<p>Stuntz’s solution is in two parts. The first is a revitalization of equal protection doctrine. He notes that one of the original purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment was to ensure that Whites and Blacks were treated the same under the criminal law. That purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was long ago discarded, however. A return to the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment will, Stuntz believes, result in a reduction of discriminatory law enforcement and punishment.</p>
<p>The second is an increase in what Stuntz calls local democracy. By this he means police departments and police officers on the street must become more responsive to the concerns of those who live in the most crime-ridden areas and more accountable for their decisions about which crimes to investigate. He sees community policing as a step in the right direction but believes much more needs to be done. In addition to making the police more accountable to those they police, the power of prosecutors needs to be reduced. There need to be fewer guilty pleas and more trials, so the public has an opportunity to impose its collective judgment on defendants rather than leaving it to overworked bureaucrats who are able to use the threat of onerous punishment to coerce guilty pleas from too many suspects.</p>
<p><italic>The Collapse of Criminal Justice</italic> is not limited to a discussion of legal doctrine; nor is it an unsubstantiated polemic. It contains a wealth of historical and empirical data—two sources which law professors often overlook. Stuntz begins by comparing and contrasting crime and punishment during the two major periods of migration to urban areas: the first being the period from the 1840s to World War I, when European immigrants filled American cities; the second being the period from World War I to the 1960s when Southern Blacks moved North to escape the Jim Crow South. He notes that the first great migration resulted in a generally lenient criminal justice system—trials were more common, not guilty verdicts were frequent, and crime rates were lower. According to Stuntz, for much of history, outside the South police and courts punished sparingly, were effective, and were fair.</p>
<p>The second great migration led to White flight to the suburbs and the subsequent detaching of criminal justice system governance from those it most directly affects. Criminal justice policy is today controlled by those who live in the suburbs, and it takes on a largely symbolic and abstract quality, as policy decisions rarely have a direct impact on suburbanites. The criminal justice system has also become much harsher in its treatment of those convicted of crime.</p>
<p>Stuntz next examines incarceration rates, and notes that as the crime rate increased in the 1960s and 1970s, criminal justice policy makers steadily increased the number of crimes and length of prison sentences. The criminal justice system changed from a relatively lenient one to a draconian one. The result has been mass incarceration, without a corresponding drop in the crime rate. This, he argues is proof that mass incarceration is not the best way to reduce crime. But it appears the political will to change incarceration policy is not there—it is of course difficult for politicians to get elected on promise to be “soft” on crime. This information is nothing new to social scientists, but its inclusion in the book, which is aimed at a broader audience, is useful.</p>
<p>The next section of the book reviews the history of criminal justice in the post–Civil War era, focusing on the different approaches taken in the North and South. This is followed by a review of equal protection doctrine and how the Supreme Court developed its narrow interpretation of that clause. Stuntz moves on to an examination of criminal justice in the first part of the 20th century, focusing on the rise of criminal laws related to moral issues, such as polygamy, prostitution, and drugs. He notes that as interest in morals offenses rose, the number of crimes on the books rose, as did the presence of federal law enforcement. Here Stuntz crosses the liberal/conservative divide, arguing in part that increased federal involvement in law enforcement is a bad thing, while at the same time disparaging efforts to control private behavior through the criminal law.</p>
<p>Stuntz works his way up to the 1950s and 1960s, and the Warren Court. Here he makes an argument sure to anger liberals, but which has some real force. He asserts the Warren Court’s many criminal procedure decisions, rather than helping improve the criminal justice system, actually had the unintended consequence of muddying the waters. Stuntz claims that the Warren Court’s focus on creating bright-line, blanket rules to control police misconduct, while well-intentioned, did not result in significantly increasing the rights of criminal suspects. This is because the police were able to work around the rules promulgated by the Warren Court, and the high court’s focus on the Bill of Rights as the source of judicial oversight of law enforcement agencies mistakenly put the focus on procedures rather than substance. Stuntz argues the Warren Court would have been better off using the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause to ensure fair and equitable law enforcement practices.</p>
<p>At the same time the Warren Court was issuing decisions widely seen as constraining the police, crime rates were increasing. The result was a tremendous backlash, the “get tough on crime” movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Politicians such as Richard Nixon used the fear of crime and general social disorder to gain power. The result was a tremendous increase in criminal laws, which made it easier for prosecutors to bully suspects into pleading guilty in exchange for a “reduction” in the number of charges filed against them, and a phenomenal increase in the number of people incarcerated and the average length of prison sentences.</p>
<p>Stuntz concludes the book with a chapter on the future of criminal justice system, in which he proposes several potential reforms. First, he suggests we should put more police on the street. Doing so will reduce crime and at the same time reduce prison populations. He believes a more visible police presence will deter some crime through an increase in the certainty of punishment. Here he is in line with a plethora of criminal justice scholars. Second, be supports giving judges greater discretion to deal with the overexpansion of the criminal law, by allowing them to impose lighter sentences where appropriate. In this he is in line with the Supreme Court’s decision in <italic>United States v. Booker</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887403412437409">2005</xref>) to change the draconian federal sentencing guidelines from mandatory to essentially advisory. Third, he would drastically reduce the severity of punishment for the use and/or possession of drugs. He acknowledges what criminal justice scholars have long known, that the drug war is a failure on every level. Fourth, he believes the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should be interpreted to require law enforcement agencies to provide the same level of police protection to all its citizens and to require prosecutors to punish all citizens the same.</p>
<p><italic>The Collapse of American Criminal Justice</italic> is an important book, a significant contribution to the literature on crime and punishment. Stuntz does an admirable job of crossing disciplinary boundaries and making a compelling case. His focus on the policy implications of legal rules and law enforcement agency practices is unusual, given his legal training. While much of his argument will not be new to criminologists, his blend of historical, empirical, and legal data makes for a strong argument and required reading for all those of us interested in how the criminal justice operates.</p>
