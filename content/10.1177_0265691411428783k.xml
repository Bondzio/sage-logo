<p>Many problems worried the French in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The dramatic fall in birth rates caused fear about depopulation and its causes. The shrinking population created a scarcity of labour, with the consequent need to find a new source of workers. The Great War aggravated the ‘man shortage’ of labourers, husbands and fathers. Moralists felt that France had lost its family values, and that women were not procreating as they might for the good of the nation. The work of French prostitutes abroad – an astounding four-fifths of prostitutes in Buenos Aires were said to be French women – provoked scandal. Prostitution in France, commentators proclaimed, sapped men’s energies and subverted legitimate reproduction, and was particularly damnable when French prostitutes catered to Arab or black colonial soldiers. Policy-makers were concerned about the arrival of increasing numbers of non-Westerners in France – from the colonies in the Maghreb, black Africa, the Caribbean and Asia – and the effects that might have, including miscegenation and <italic>métissage</italic>, on the French race.</p>
<p>Elisa Camiscioli’s book brings these topics together in a fascinating and persuasive fashion. Using a wealth of archival and published material, including the writings of pro-natalists, colonial lobbyists, demographers, eugenicists and specialists in the <italic>science du travail</italic> (including Fernand Boverat, Georges Mauco, Jules Amar, René Martial and Paul Leroy-Beaulieu), as well as the records of many heretofore obscure and unexplored associations, and reports in the press, she analyses the anxieties of the elite about the very survival of the French race in the face of those problems. ‘Race’ is an important word, for despite the universalistic and contractarian nature of French ideology – in theory, potential access to citizenship and Frenchness for all – Camiscioli finds that debates on depopulation, migration and labour were highly racialized, and also gendered. Migration might be necessary, but supporters of it established clear hierarchies of desirable candidates: Belgians and Swiss, then ‘white’ Italians and Spaniards (thought, with admiration, to be happily fecund), followed by eastern Europeans and Levantines, with men and women of colour a distant, and dangerous, last on the list.</p>
<p>Views on population were, perhaps inevitably, convoluted and contradictory, but they held considerable importance since, at the end of the 1800s, the French population was reproducing itself at the lowest rate in the world, and by the 1920s France had become the most important destination for immigrants in the industrialized world. Those favouring migration preferred men and women who would give birth to large numbers of children and would acculturate easily, but also foreshadowed that acculturation would mean a drop in the size of their families. Migrants were welcomed when jobs were plentiful, and no doubt those who came hoped that they could remain, but many were expelled from France during the Depression. France championed its empire as a source of profit and pride, but tried to restrict the number of colonized people who actually settled in France and treated them with discrimination when they did. Efforts to stamp out prostitution were based on assumptions about the evils of extra-marital sex, despite official sponsorship of military brothels, and the supposition that any prostitute was a pawn in the hands of ‘white slavers’. The supposed republican values trumpeted in the 1930s, as Camiscioli argues, led the way towards the more repulsive racial views of the anti-republican Pétain regime and its national revolution.</p>
<p>Camiscioli provides good material and analysis of various developments, for instance, the passage of an important law in 1927 that made it possible for a French woman to keep her citizenship if she married a foreign man. Previously, such a woman automatically lost her citizenship, which reformers noted amounted to a loss of reproductive potential to the nation, and led to bizarre situations, as when French-born women married to foreigners but living in France had to pay the tax levied on non-French residents.</p>
<p>Camiscioli’s work occasionally shows irritating traces of a doctoral thesis – lots of ‘interrogating’ of various issues and quoting of ‘theorists’ in the introduction, much setting out of what will be done in various sections, continual references back and forth from chapter to chapter – that could have been smoothed out in the editing. The overriding concepts of ‘embodiment’ and ‘the intimate’, the ways in which issues of French policy concentrated on the body (phenotypes, reproduction, etc.), do not strictly seem necessary to cap the different issues, but her reach to encompass various types of history and scholarship in relation to biopolitics is successful. This is a very fine brief volume (with 159 pages of text), informative on many areas of interest to historians of politics, labour, migration, science and colonialism. It is, as well, a timely study in light of current French debates, and debates elsewhere, about immigration, citizenship and multi-culturalism, which eerily recall the racialized discussions of almost a century ago.</p>
