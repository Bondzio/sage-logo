<p>One great thing about this book is its capacity to surprise me. It is an engaging, wide-ranging, yet disparate collection of essays reflecting the focus of the organizations that brought the authors together: the Yale Information Society Project and the Yale Law School. The books’ contributors are predominantly male (14/16), with only one chapter solely authored by a woman – Dorothy E Denning, Distinguished Professor of Defense Analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. The writers’ backgrounds are more balanced than the gender inclusiveness: nine authors have a legal training or are associated with, for example, legal history; four have expertise in international politics or international affairs; two are defence specialists; a further two offer sociological perspectives while one represents the disciplines of economics and finance. (As can be deduced, there are two authors whose expertise encompasses two of these categories.)</p>
<p>Whereas a casual consideration of a book title such as <italic>The Global Flow of Information</italic> might imply that the volume is informed by the usual disciplines of media, communication and cultural studies, this expectation would be in error. The subtitle ‘Legal, Social and Cultural Perspectives’ is apposite in foregrounding the legal, but for my money the social and cultural win a distant second and third place in the pecking order. This is borne out in a review of index entries. ‘Media’, for example, is formally referenced twice: ‘piracy, 56; and democracy, 60’ (p. 256); ‘remittances’, not at all; ‘digital divide’ or ‘inclusion’, none (although ‘knowledge divide’ occurs on p. 84). ‘Virilio, Paul’, occurs once, referencing ‘209’ (p. 259). In fact, and as a word of caution for readers like me who value indexes, the sentence about Virilio’s work on the ‘aesthetics of disappearance’ and the ‘infosphere’ is actually on p. 208. For an audience used to new humanities perspectives, this book contains a range of material which is comparatively unexpected. Using a deconstructive approach, the volume tells us more about the interests and perspectives of a select group of US academics with particular expertise in aspects of global trends analysis than it does about any content I might have anticipated. (But see Chapter 4 for an exception to this generalization.)</p>
<p>The book’s 14 chapters are divided into six sections: two introductory chapters; four on ‘culture’ (from a particularly legalistic perspective); three on politics and law; one on science and medicine; two on war; and two on power. We learn in the introductory chapter that the volume has had a prolonged gestation and represents the best contributions to a 2005 Yale Law School conference, revised, repurposed and resubmitted for inclusion in the edited book, published by New York University Press. The result is a worthwhile achievement, but is unusually lacking in coherence, or in a sense of its own story. Instead, the vision for the volume seems to be one of showcasing a range of mostly individually interesting contributions.</p>
<p>The first chapter, by the editors, is an overview of the volume which is positioned as ‘coming a full twelve years after Castells’ trilogy was published’ (p. 8). Castells’ work is referenced only fleetingly, however, on p. 4. Instead, there are five key questions informing the book listed on p. 9 and these are more focused on how to control or regulate information flows than on how to understand them. The second introductory chapter advances ‘three models of globalization’ – the corner deli (integrating and intertwining local/regional/global); the German/Austrian restaurant chain Weinerwald – ‘clustered globalization’; and ‘hegemonistic globalization’, represented by McDonaldization. There is no reference to, say, seminal texts such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323112470769">Morley and Robins (1995)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323112470769">Ritzer (1996)</xref>. It would be easy to minimize the provocative value of this chapter (for example the throwaway line that ‘the erosion of Russian cultural centrality from Eastern Europe after 1989 took perhaps less than a year’, p. 28), but there’s plenty of citable material to react to, such as ‘American centrality is quite robust … in the absence of any global competitor, American dominance appears safe’ (p. 34).</p>
<p>In Part I: Culture, the focus turns to cultural products such as the global flows of Hollywood film and the outsourcing of elements of the production chain, such as to animators in Japan. Liang’s Chapter 4, on copyright in emerging economies, is written from the perspective of Bangalore, India. This is one of the jewels of the book, conceptualizing film and video piracy as an example of ‘the building of infrastructure’ by those without ready access to state-sanctioned knowledge via ‘a self-organized and organic task involving kinship networks’ (p. 57). Liang uses Lawrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323112470769">Lessig (2004)</xref> to argue that the piracy of intellectual property is wrong, but suggests instead that ‘conventional criticisms of piracy are premised on narrow ideas of creativity, because of their exclusive focus on the question of authorship and content to the exclusion of [access to cultural] infrastructure’. The subsequent chapter discusses the power of IP rights-holders in terms of the digitization of, and global network access to, cultural heritage(s), particularly as articulated in debates around the Google Books project. The final chapter in this Culture section is around the value of weak protectionist measures on imported cultural content as a means of supporting local cultural creation. This is familiar territory to an Australian reviewer since Australia has long promoted quotas on, and supported, local content.</p>
<p>The first chapter in Part II: Politics and Law assesses the interesting idea as to whether the internet has more greatly empowered governmental control of citizens, or citizens’ capacity to hold governments accountable. The answer appears to be ‘a bit of both’, but there is a range of useful examples. Chapter 8 looks at the practice of state-dictated mandatory internet filtering and why this is not of more concern to the organs of internet governance, such as ICANN. The final essay in this section examines the capacity of the internet to facilitate ‘potentially incompatible law regimes’ (p. 156), and the dangers inherent in attempts to apply international regulation. Part III focuses on Science and Medicine and comprises one chapter, on emerging markets and pharmaceutical supplies. Its argument is that ‘vigilance and affirmative action’ (p. 188) are required to prevent global pharmaceutical companies from ‘foreclosing competition in the market for generic products’ (p. 185). The book’s four remaining chapters are equally divided between Part IV: War and Part V: Power.</p>
<p>Kaplan’s discussion of ‘The flow of information in modern warfare’ (Chapter 11) is everything we ever wanted to know about drone warfare excepting an ethical dimension. The networks that support ‘an armed Predator unmanned aerial vehicle … half a world away’ (p. 196) are celebrated as relocating ‘power to the edge’, decreasing hierarchical distance and integrating strategic, operational and tactical warfare (p. 196). The question raised is whether the current internet should be reinvigorated by ‘secure computing paradigms’ (p. 201). This chapter is balanced, to some extent, by its successor. James Der Derian is keen to wrest ‘the promise of the information age’ (p. 206) from the jaws of ‘the age of terror’ (p. 205) and pursues this agenda via eight propositions for studying infoflows. Discussing infowar and infopeace, this is the chapter that references Virilio. It also cites Arendt’s view that evil is banal, ‘only the good has depth and can be radical’ (p. 213). I enjoyed the sense of a shared vocabulary I experienced reading this chapter. Chapter 13, ‘Power over information flow’ (the chapter by Dorothy E Denning), skims a discussion of the dynamics of information flow as compromised by the blockage and censoring of these flows. Its usefulness is reduced by a complete absence of cited sources.</p>
<p>The final chapter is full of ideas. Jack M Balkin’s treatise on ‘Information power: the information society from an antihumanist perspective’ uses three original perspectives to examine digital information technologies: ‘the memetic model, the Gaia model, and the proliferation of power model’ (p. 232). Leaving aside my own commitment to a social shaping of technology approach, this focus on investigating ‘forms of power that shape human beings, exercise control over them and reshape their attitudes […treating] human beings as the constructions and unwitting agents of larger forces’ (pp. 232–233) is creative and provocative in equal measure. Together with Laing’s essay, these two chapters alone would justify the investment required to order this comparatively attractively priced hardback book for the library.</p>
