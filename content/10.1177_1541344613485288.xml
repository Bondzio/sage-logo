<abstract>
<p>English teachers encourage writing that opens college students to transformative learning through soul work as John Dirkx describes and develops the concept of soul work in his theory of transformative learning. This soul work involves the conscious attempt to bring to the surface myths, images, and metaphors from the unconscious through imaginative writing and thinking processes. Participants in this study engage in personal interviews through which they answer questions about the activities most useful for soul work inside their classrooms and the results of their soul work experiences. Through phenomenological methodology, the lived experiences of six community college English teachers yield valuable results that connect holistic learning, soul work, and transformative learning theory. Soul work occurs in English classes when, according to the participants of this study, teachers and students enter a call, movement, and response relationship.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As a college English teacher with a responsibility to design deeply meaningful course material, my interest in the phenomenon of soul work in transformative learning began when a few writers experienced an enlivened energy, more prolific writing, more explicit enthusiasm, and more focus for learning as they dug deeply into their essay topics. In one example, one student, after reading an essay about a sculpture located off a Nebraska rest stop, took her family the following weekend to find the art because it had been “bothering” her. In the following class, she shared the emotional and spiritual discoveries from that trip during which she came to understand the deeper historical and familial meaning of that symbol and the emotional places long buried somewhere in her psyche. While not all engage as deeply every term, those who do express a willingness to travel to the roots of this phenomenon, and as their teacher, the results of their exploration and transformation have focused my attention to the processes involved.</p>
<p>The experiences and the analyses have involved the mind, body, and soul of the learners and me. The phenomena were not solely cognitive, emotional, or corporeal. The <italic>whole</italic> learner and the <italic>whole</italic> environment matter. Dirkx’s (2006a, p. 32) vision of soul work as “development of self knowledge and authenticity” through “a conscious, imaginative engagement of the unconscious dimensions of the self” is useful as a reference point for soul work behavior. Teachers engage in soul work, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541344613485288">Dirkx (2006a</xref>), when they attend to emotional responses of students. Teachers do this by having students write about images, metaphors, symbols, and images in stories, essays, and articles, and, in some cases, using fantasy to connect to characters.</p>
<p>As a pathway to soul work experience, the context of soul work in the classroom is the interaction between a more conscious self and several unconscious selves appearing in the form of images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541344613485288">Dirkx, 2001</xref>). To work the soul, learners and teachers make the effort to “recognize, name, and give voice to these images and to integrate them more fully within the wholeness of their beings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541344613485288">Dirkx, 2001</xref>, p. 16). The students of the teachers in this study come in contact with images that pull at their hearts and engage their minds to make sense of a partially illuminated whole.</p>
<p>By wholeness, Dirkx describes a connection between conscious and unconscious parts, a centered self. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541344613485288">Dirkx (2006a</xref>) argues that the work of the soul involves the “extrarational and imaginative” processes that allow for emotional and intuitive solutions to problems. The students in this study and those in my classes feel a rising understanding, something for which they had felt was true but had not to that point pieced together in a coherent way.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541344613485288">Dirkx (2006b</xref>), teachers and students must be aware of the transformative power of emotions. Engaging, stimulating, holistic curriculum approaches the emotional and spiritual aspects of images and their meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541344613485288">Dirkx, 2008</xref>). Allowing for emotion, teachers seek to understand it. Students sometimes cry in my classes, cries of release or of satisfaction. They often shake with emotion and smile knowingly as what they feel comes to the surface in the lives of their classmates. Recently, a student acknowledged in class the profound effect a classmate’s essays had on him. This classmate, a marginalized adult learner, drew praise from the other classmates as well, encouraged by their peer’s admission. Because the initial praise of the student came from one who had shown spirited difference and even distaste for the marginalized classmate, the event represented harmony of strong differences.</p>
<p>Learners who would not otherwise be engaged in a college English course find engagement through their emotional and spiritual selves. Holistic learning may provide an adhesive for learners through a balance of selves, inclusion of alternative learning techniques, and connection to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541344613485288">Miller, 2007</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541344613485288">Kovan and Dirkx (2003</xref>) identify transformative learning for the whole student, through emotional and spiritual aspects, which leads to social commitment. In this way, holistic learning, transformative learning, and soul work are closely aligned: Holistic learning is the theoretical lens, soul work is one method within it, and learner transformation is the primary goal. Just what is it that college English teachers do to encourage “soul work” in a writing classroom? This study demonstrates an answer as the confluence of holistic learning, soul work, and transformative learning.</p>

<title>Method and Design</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541344613485288">Creswell (2009</xref>) notes, “Phenomenological research uses the analysis of significant statements, the generation of meaning units, and the development” of an essence (p. 184). Phenomenology is an “attempt to understand the meaning of events and interactions to ordinary people in particular situations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541344613485288">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007</xref>, p. 25). Constructivism, the search for meaning through an individual’s construction of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541344613485288">Bush, 2006</xref>), is the guiding philosophy. One constructs knowledge, one does not acquire it so much (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541344613485288">Chen, Chung, Crane, &amp; Hlavach, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>English teachers, approximately 150 full-time and part-time teachers, at one Midwest community college were queried through e-mail about their possible experiences with soul work as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541344613485288">Dirkx (2006a</xref>). Of that group, seven English teachers recognized experiences of similar quality to that of soul work as described in this study, but one withdrew from the study before it began due to unrelated personal matters. The e-mailed responses from the teachers began with the engagement of deeper learning and writing processes in the students’ lives and the teachers’ own recognition of their own transformative teaching goals. These main research questions focused the inquiry of the six teachers:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What specific activities are useful to teachers who perform Dirkx’s “soul work” in their classrooms?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What specific “soul work” activities are practiced outside the classrooms that support the “soul work” inside the classroom?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Research Question 3</italic>: What are the results of this “soul work”?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Once the six who had experienced the phenomenon intensely were identified, interviews followed. The advantage of using interviews is to build a context for subjective meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541344613485288">Creswell, 2009</xref>). The interviews consisted of 13 open-ended questions related to the phenomenon of the participants’ experience (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1541344613485288">Appendix</xref>), set in a 90-min time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541344613485288">Seidman, 2006</xref>). The interviews were recorded by audiotape. A professional transcription service was used to transcribe the results of the interviews.</p>
<p>After the interviews, the researcher coded the results to spiral into the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541344613485288">Creswell, 2009</xref>). The deeper movement into the phenomenon involved reviewing the transcripts multiple times to record any words, phrases, or sentences that seemed very relevant to the topics involved in soul work. The list of insights grew to 391, and from those meaning units, 15 codes emerged. Common with phenomenology, the researcher coded with an eye for meaningful statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541344613485288">Creswell, 2009</xref>). These codes emerged from the data and were not predetermined, leading to less researcher bias. The coding identified “regularities and patterns” with the use of colored highlighters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541344613485288">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007</xref>, p. 173). Coding by hand is necessary, for most computer programs do not help with phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17a-1541344613485288">Groenewald, 2004</xref>). Creative insight, holistic meaning, and nonverbal language all contribute in phenomenology and the researcher is part of the vital instrumentation, making human judgments with rich description. As a final step, the codes were grouped according to likeness in function. This is where the three major themes from the data became clearer.</p>
<sec id="section3-1541344613485288">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Soul work, according to these participants, appears in a three-part relationship: “Call,” “Movement,” and “Response.” Call consists of metaphors, truth, consciousness, and creation. Movement consists of dialoguing, questioning, hearing, awakening, and struggling. Response consists of change, connection, self, wholeness, voice, and awareness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1541344613485288">
<title>Three-Part Relationship</title>
<p>As Participant 4 discussed her love of creative space, she remembered a Malaysian student who, upon learning about the poetic form the pantoum, could not stop writing in that form. In fact, the student loved the pantoum so much that she wrote a master’s thesis about it. What is most striking is that the student had no idea before writing in the form that it was native to her country of origin. Participant 4 said, “But to have this whole history that we don’t know anything about. And it was all this call and response stuff in their culture.” Interestingly, the pantoum poetic form is used to unearth meaning from memories and mysteries. The idea of call and response seems a suitable frame for soul work since many students, like this one, have no clear idea of the history attached to the symbol of interest but are drawn to it. This movement, or journey, involves attachment or awareness of something unconscious: “The concept of individuation provides a theoretical framework in which we are able to relate these aspects of transformation to the journey of the self, a journey that involves a recognition of the self in relation to the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541344613485288">Kovan &amp; Dirkx, 2003</xref>, p. 102). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344613485288">Jung’s (1989)</xref> individuation is in process. Bringing the unconscious to consciousness sets apart the self and joins it to a collective through individuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541344613485288">Lawrence &amp; Cranton, 2009</xref>). The joining of the unconscious to conscious awareness is described in this study as movement. Thus, the model of soul work methods discovered through this study consists of the relationship of call, movement, and response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1541344613485288">
<title>Call</title>
<p>Call involves the use of metaphors, truth, consciousness, and creation to attract students to deeper learning.</p>
<sec id="section6-1541344613485288">
<title>Metaphor</title>
<p>Metaphor is useful in calling students’ attention to something other than what is or what appears to be. One might enter the landscape of transformation through a “personal engagement” with metaphor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541344613485288">Dyson, 2010</xref>, p. 15). However, Participant 5 discusses the difficulty for students involved in this engagement: “They struggle with metaphorical thinking, the ambiguity, to live in the ambiguity.” In English courses, my students want a list of words or phrases to use in specific instances. They often want to see models of essays as well. They would like to be told, in many cases, what is or is not “right.” However, for deeper transformation, a less detailed map is ideal. Teachers and learners, who let go of the myth of control, allow the space for ambiguity and uncertainty, crucial components of transformative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541344613485288">Poutiatine, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1541344613485288">
<title>Truth</title>
<p>Constructivism serves as partial solution to illusory teacher control. One teacher explains, “I try to make a really big free and secure space where they feel free enough and comfortable and secure enough to exchange versions of truth so that we can all just be as honest as we want” (Participant 1). In constructivism, the student and teacher collaborate in learning through “power sharing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541344613485288">Fume, 2005</xref>, p. 54). Sharing the truth of experiences can lead to transformation since others’ truths often lead to cognitive dissonance. Learners are transformed when they move towards reinterpretation not rote memorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541344613485288">Jones, 2009</xref>). As a result, the use of truth in soul work is the sharing of one’s experiences and power in a safe space. Further, sharing of truth includes slowing down. One teacher recollects, “So not only did I stutter when I was in school because I was afraid to reveal myself I was afraid of the blank page because I was afraid to reveal myself. And when I learned how to slow down, inhale and tell the truth when I talk I quit stuttering” (Participant 6). The open dialogue of truth allows room for exploration of the blocks to clear writing and thinking, which in many cases come through the inability to be transparent or vulnerable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1541344613485288">
<title>Consciousness</title>
<p>When consciousness emerges during the participants’ experiences with soul work, it appears as a process of becoming more aware of something beyond the self or surface. Participant 4 exhorts, “Let the writing take you where it wants to go. But there’s that struggle between the conscious, the planned versus the unplanned.” During soul work, some teachers may make this struggle between conscious and unconscious motivations explicit, even necessary, for clearer writing and thinking. Engaging in struggles with the conscious and unconscious selves leads to awareness of identity and the transformation of the person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541344613485288">Kovan &amp; Dirkx, 2003</xref>). Because conscious and unconscious awareness are often not chronological or time dependent, the attraction to unifying or complementing the two areas could be new connections or interpretations to old events and ideas. The English classroom seems a likely place for such a struggle of consciousness in part because teachers expect learners to engage the whole self within the drafting and revising space. One writes from one’s history and the history of the human race with an effort to connect experiences to new lines of future thoughts and actions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541344613485288">Dyson (2010</xref>) offers the idea that one cannot change another’s consciousness; it is a self-authoring process. Participant 2 connects a rise in consciousness to the self-authoring phenomenon. She discusses the work of Paulo Freire’s community groups that assisted “with literacy, critical consciousness, and helping people become educationally aware of their own power that they were—it was called self-empowerment, education for critical consciousness, increasing people’s political abilities and actions” (Participant 2). The identity formation as a result of heightened consciousness in students in this vein signals an understanding of the self as an agent of change through self-authoring. One can write from the place of transformation by being made aware of one’s power to self-actualize.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1541344613485288">
<title>Creation</title>
<p>The empowered, self-authoring student creates something new on paper from an internal connection of unique experiences and ideas. One teacher describes the condition of many writers who enter the self-authoring experience for the first time with old, unexamined habits of mind. She says, “So if a child was mistreated or starved or neglected or spanked or any kind of [negative] thing, at that time, it became known to the child through the senses and during the time that trust was being developed. So the child would create a world from that instead of [positive] experiences” (Participant 2). Questioning the personal within the writer seems necessary to seed new inventions. The new worldview of the young learner, then, is a guarded and narrowed one. Some educators describe their method of creation as opening a space for new birth. One teacher shares the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’d just say, “What do you think? That’s nice, isn’t it?” I wouldn’t tell them why I was doing what I was doing. But just to keep hearing it and hearing it, for me that was the experience of the soul of the work. It was coming into me, and I wasn’t creating a barrier. (Participant 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541344613485288">Dyson (2010</xref>) focuses this: “Guiding others in learning situations, or in counseling situations, rather than telling, directing, instructing, and controlling others, is a way forward and potentially leads individuals to self-evaluation, self-monitoring, and self-control” (p. 13). Teachers bridge students over depths where the evaluation of the myths, metaphors, and images of the unconscious occur. Participant 2 recounts a story of an inventive student attracted to creativity yet unable to cross the distance between his world and the perceived world of academia:
<disp-quote>
<p>And so when he creates the wrestler, he has to give a whole, like a name, an identity, a whole background. So there’s a lot of writing in there involved. And he gets very passionate about this thing, about this online wrestling and his characters. (Participant 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As a projection of the self, perhaps, this student is able to create something significant through writing about the wrestler as if he is a real being. When the self is stuck in writing because of oppressive form or expectation of order, a method identified here is the creation of a fantasy world that connects what is important to the writer practically in order to help form the writer academically. The creation matters first, the process of reproducing the method only later.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1541344613485288">
<title>Movement</title>
<p>Movement, as identified in the lived experiences of these participants, describes the actions of dialoguing, questioning, hearing, awakening, and struggling.</p>
<sec id="section11-1541344613485288">
<title>Dialoguing</title>
<p>Because many English students enter a course in composition with some baggage from past writing teachers or past life experiences with caregivers, dialoguing seems less like a tool for the “Call” theme and more like a movement toward complementary space. Simply put, transformative meaning becomes much more relevant through “critical discourse with others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344613485288">Kitchenham, 2008</xref>, p. 113). Dialoguing is engaging in the conversation. Inviting the silenced or oppressed learners to talk or to have the floor for a time aids in the creation of a new voice. One teacher tries to identify learners who could use dialogue with a writing experience: “Dialogue with them, talk to them, particularly ones who are struggling with where to go with it” (Participant 5). Besides its guiding function, dialoguing with learners pushes beyond maintenance and into transformative learning, or at the very least, into critical reflection—a preliminary phase in transformation. Dialogue, like discourse, “has as its goal reaching a common understanding and justification of an interpretation or belief. People present reasons for their beliefs, weigh the evidence given in others’ arguments, consider alternative perspectives, and come to a tentative best judgment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541344613485288">Cranton &amp; Carusetta, 2004</xref>, p. 289). Teachers who find a place for open dialogue in a secure space position students in a transformative space. Transformation of meaning perspectives occurs when something dissimilar with one’s worldview leads to critical reflection of one’s system of belief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541344613485288">Jones, 2009</xref>). A teacher uses soul work when he or she dialogues with learners at the locations of their struggles to help them articulate the systems of belief or knowledge being held together partially by unconscious adherence to myths, metaphors, and images of the past.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1541344613485288">
<title>Questioning</title>
<p>Like dialoguing as a method of movement in soul work, questioning seeks multiple voices to process meaning. Most participants in this research delight in the use of questions. One says, “I ask questions and help them, just kind of coach them, really, until they empty” (Participant 1). The questions require a response or movement into the conversation, an emptying of the prior static positioning. Another recollects, “There is a lot of participation and a lot of questions. So that slows us down a lot but I do like that. I want them to ask questions” (Participant 4). The questioning movement takes time, perhaps because it requires two-way communication and critical reflection on the assumptions and underlying meanings within the messages conveyed. She continues, “Sometimes just one teacher’s question will do it. The right question” and “Yeah I think it’s important to ask the right question and again it would be what touches that center of a person … You’re jolted sort of” (Participant 4). Of all the information possible, one phrase or sentence can blur the significance of all the rest. Another teacher recalls, “And so there would be times where a student would—I could see it, they would have that epiphany, they would get it because of the question that I asked or an exchange that we had. And they got it” (Participant 5). Through movement into the open space, free students respond to questions they might never have asked themselves to grow in ways they might never have foreseen. Because the teacher envisions the student for what he or she could be and not as the image projected or believed in the student’s mind, transformation is possible once the student faces cognitive dissonance with patience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344613485288">Cranton and Wright (2008</xref>) note the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>An individual who begins to see himself or herself as being capable of learning and exchanging knowledge with others is calling into question his or her previous habits of mind. This questioning or critical reflection can then lead to a revision of a value, belief, assumption, or even a broader perspective. If this happens, transformative learning has taken place. (p. 34)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The myth made conscious could be that a student’s value is measured incorrectly by his or her past inability to answer prerehearsed pedantic questions. Some mature learners grow while facing “high levels of uncertainty and ambiguity,” by practicing exploration through a “continual questioning of life’s direction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541344613485288">Kovan &amp; Dirkx, 2003</xref>, p. 106). Likewise, Participant 5 reveals his method of allowing for the birth of living questions:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t want to at the end of reading something immediately jump to the discussion question that you’d see at the end of a chapter. It might be a personal comment like I’ll say, “Boy, I’m just really struck by that line there. Can you feel that?”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The “that” of the question sets up a potential discussion of the other, which by its very mention requires more questions. The writing teacher open to questions instead of closed to predestined answers produces questioning learners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1541344613485288">
<title>Hearing</title>
<p>To respond to the movement of questions during soul work, participants also discuss hearing as important action. Participant 5 elaborates, “I would re-read a line again and again and again. I wouldn’t tell them why I was doing what I was doing. But just to keep hearing it and hearing it, for me that was the experience of the soul.” Eliciting response requires movement into the mysterious or ambiguous. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17b-1541344613485288">Hanlin-Rowney et al. (2006</xref>) suggest this type of hearing is like listening to the soul without making meaning. While there seems ample time to make meaning of information, perhaps through the movement of hearing, students’ patient quiet allows for the mind, emotion, body, and spirit in a holistic experience. Careful to distinguish between hearing and listening, one of the participants believes a vital element separates the two actions, so she teaches her students how to tell the difference. She contends, “And then we went to sound, and we talked about how sound is different than listening. First of all, that if you’re listening, you’re listening and remembering. If you’re just hearing it, sound can be shut off” (Participant 2). One could theorize then that remembering is the opening to an ongoing communication. In this way, deep hearing is listening and remembering the communication of the various myths, metaphors, and images of the past, like those of the student writer and the roadside sculpture that introduced this article. A text or communication can lead one back again and again “in explicable ways, held captive by them for varying lengths of time, seemingly spellbound by their messages—our inner worlds refracted through the lens of image and metaphor and story” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541344613485288">Dirkx, Mezirow, &amp; Cranton, 2006</xref>, p. 127). Hearing, as described by these participants, takes time, a sense of personal space, a reflective teacher, and a willingness to allow the ongoing communication to take us where it may.</p>

<title>Awakening</title>
<p>The movement of awakening, like dialoguing, questioning, and hearing thrives through authentic, trusting relationships in the classroom. One of the participants describes a lowering into the depths of human experience: “When I say I take them down, I do mean that in their own writing. But I mean it in a broader sense than that. I mean awaken them to human suffering, to the gravity of the human condition” (Participant 1). To awaken is to go down and to be aware of what really matters. This awakening to broader experiences removed from the students’ affective domain likely causes dissonance in learners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27a-1541344613485288">Scott (2003</xref>) expresses, “social action disrupts, bothers, and interferes with the established internal structures of the psyche as well as external structures in the world, and it is this constant state of disequilibrium that supports transformation” (p. 280). In a sense, the awakening allows for the conscious exploration of human pleasure and pain. The result may be a spiritual reflection leading to a weighty realization of pleasure and pain as ubiquitous. Education is the experience of whole people, so when one teaches, one’s mind, spirit, and body are “aligned” in the act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344613485288">Shahjahan, 2004</xref>, p. 299). While participants did not use the words “spiritual awakening” at any point, some used the language and imagery of spiritual truth. For example, one teacher uses the metaphor of a small seed: “Something has to be awakened and there’s got to be a little—I mean, there may be like a thousand dead little seedlings in there, but there’s like one little sprout that’s waiting” (Participant 3). The image of student as a seedling for new life seems a powerful motivation to encourage awakening. What is education if not this?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1541344613485288">
<title>Struggling</title>
<p>Perhaps, of all the movements discovered, the one most inherent in transformative learning is struggling. One participant discusses the connections between soul work and struggling to find meaning through writing. He says, “Let the writing take you where it wants to go. But there’s that struggle between the conscious, the planned versus the unplanned. So for the assignments that I create, start with free writing” (Participant 5). His inclusion of free writing seems logical since soul work includes the release of the controlling consciousness to discover meaning through the reflection on unconscious myths, metaphors, and images. Transformative learning occurs when one gets out of his or her way to know the subject as it is fully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541344613485288">Lawrence &amp; Cranton, 2009</xref>). The writer’s plan most often only considers other pathways to knowledge when personal pain enters the equation and one cannot take the well-worn path in comfort.</p>
<p>The struggle of the writing student involves not only surface concerns but the plugging into a stream of ideas to find unconscious knowing. Not <italic>knowing</italic> can lead to listening to hidden ideas and is “anchored within a continual openness to learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541344613485288">Kovan &amp; Dirkx, 2003</xref>, p. 106). It seems the less one controls past conscious knowledge, the more likely one is to hear from hidden places. Teachers struggle to be free from patterns of control, which lead to less creativity and, perhaps, less contact with the unconscious. Students already have the restrictive voices in mind. A teacher suggests, “Dialogue with them, talk to them, particularly ones who are struggling with where to go with it. I’ve gotten more in trouble I would say in the last four or five years [because] I became more and more prescriptive, managing, managerial of their learning” (Participant 5). The managerial self, perhaps, the “I” of the conscious person, leads some teachers and students toward a narrowed structure of control, away from the open creative space of discovery.</p>
<p>The struggle for student and teacher involves giving up a measure of control in order to allow creation for the student and the teacher. This is no different than working in a team to accomplish a particular project, but for soul work to occur, the effort to loosen control runs far deeper. It would necessitate personal vulnerability. Perhaps, this is what Participant 2 had in mind when she warned future English teachers of the coming struggle to come to awareness of the task of teaching. She questions, “Didn’t you know it would call on every aspect of your being to try to get a hold of somebody and change what’s going on in their head?” (Participant 2). Certainly her passion for learners rings out clearly as does her awareness of the likelihood of dissonance in education. Disorientation about social roles sparks the reflection necessary for transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541344613485288">Brock, 2010</xref>). The struggle for students who want to reach down through the conscious barriers poses a disorienting dilemma for learners; much in the same way, the teacher of English struggles to allow freedom for the writer to experience a range of emotions related to his or her own personal story without blanketing creation with prescription.</p>

<sec id="section16-1541344613485288">
<title>Response</title>
<p>After “Movement” in the lived experiences of the college English student, transformations could be described as responses to the “Call.” The “Response” theme includes change, connection, self, wholeness, voice, and awareness.</p>
<sec id="section17-1541344613485288">
<title>Change</title>
<p>Describing the experience of revision of thought, experience, and writing product, one teacher elaborates: “It’s like sculpture. Shape it. Change it” (Participant 1). Thankfully, the plasticity of the human brain supports worldview transformation. The concern for many writing teachers extends beyond past grammatical or syntactic habits into the psychological reasons for communication issues. Another teacher says, “I wonder if something would have been different in their background. If they would have—if today they were better readers and writers, let’s say. Would they be in the same path in life? Would that have changed anything?” (Participant 3). A step further, perhaps, is the acknowledgment of writing revision as wide-ranging life change, which according to one teacher, leads to validation when connected to the learner’s psychological past: “So they start to identify more with I can be successful. I take these steps towards effort. I start to be more confident. It’s not a case of I suck at writing, or I’m always going to suck at writing. There’s a way to change it” (Participant 3). Being stuck in writing could be a case of being stuck in life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344613485288">Cranton and Wright (2008</xref>) explain, “People whose lives are marginalized by their literacy skills need to be able to imagine another kind of life altogether to be able to enter into the learning” (p. 45). Participant 4 connects this within the teaching mission: “I think we’re the ones that maybe have the best chance to really change people and maybe not change people, help them find themselves. And that really should be what education is about anyway.” Once a learner extends the meaning of revision beyond the paper product or final essay, the student seems to be able to revise the myth of being a personal failure because of past attempts at writing.</p>
<p>Change on a final draft does not belie psychological transformation. Transformation is more than change, it is a remodeling of one’s “behaviors, competencies, beliefs, identity, and mission” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541344613485288">Poutiatine, 2009</xref>, p. 198). One teacher encourages the students to focus on change through writing “a story about a transformative experience, an experience that changed you from this to that. How did the change occur?” (Participant 5). This student’s volitional efficacy serves as proof of change: “My life has changed so much since the beginning of this project. I’m no longer afraid to be vulnerable with those who are close to me and stand up to those who mock me” (Participant 5). Another teacher had his own experience of transformation when a caring teacher would not allow him to stay attached to his old myths and images. He recollects, “It chokes me up to even talk about it today because she helped change my life too. As I said, I went in after school that time and asked why do you care about me so much?” (Participant 6). Care leads to movement and response through trust within the English classroom: “When the literacy learner feels respected, he moves into a trusting relationship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344613485288">Cranton &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>, p. 39). A response to the “Call” and “Movement” within soul work is change to the written product and change in the writer’s self.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1541344613485288">
<title>Connection</title>
<p>Once writers and teachers view interactions as transformative learning opportunities, teachers and learners collaborate through connection. The connection to the other is a learned behavior that imbues a love of learning: “If I could connect with that person, then I could learn everything that person could teach me. But if I couldn’t connect with that person, there was nothing that I could sit still for” (Participant 2). Deep connection between learner and teacher may lead to the mentor–mentee relationship. The connection typically involves more than a relationship of two minds. Bringing one’s authentic whole self to teaching and learning leads to an attraction and connection with learning material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344613485288">Shahjahan, 2004</xref>). Then, the journey to discovery and transformation can occur with attention to the unconscious. One teacher agrees that connection to the teacher leads to connection to the learning material, through which transformation may occur. She proclaims: “soul work and achievement are definitely connected” (Participant 3). Sharing life stories in groups expands social and self-knowledge and releases people to become leaders in public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27a-1541344613485288">Scott, 2003</xref>). Students who connect to teachers in an authentic relationship are freed to share life stories. When the stories are met with immediate interest instead of immediate measurement by the writing teacher and even honored for a time as part of one’s unique and important journey, the likelihood that a student will connect to whatever that teacher is teaching is higher. Human respect leads to content connection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1541344613485288">
<title>Self</title>
<p>Teachers see a strengthening or distinguishing of the self in students. The journey from the connecting response to the generation of a new self is striking:
<disp-quote>
<p>Okay, yeah, because it’s an emotional connection. It touches something at the heart of them. And it’s happened to me as a writer. I mean it’s happened to me and I know how you just get so excited and it sends you off in a new direction of thinking. (Participant 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This is likely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541344613485288">Mezirow’s (2000)</xref> epochal transformation. Suddenly, the center of a person is touched and the self spreads itself to learn. The long-term effect of this spreading is a “lived stance toward a sense of call” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541344613485288">Kovan &amp; Dirkx, 2003</xref>, p. 114). Here again, the idea of a “Call” seems a likely metaphor for a point in the soul work process. Participant 1 characterizes the relationship between the writer’s conscious ideas and the flow of the unconscious with a powerful distinction: “But the story that their deeper self wants told is a different one” (Participant 1). His notion of the deeper self is likely the deeper selves of Jungian thought, the unconscious. Critical reflection and emotional and spiritual awareness are necessary to soul work. One teacher laments the loss of self: “But most of the time, people with poor self esteem never felt like they had anything important to say” (Participant 2). Participant 3 agrees. She finds that she wants her students to reflect on important issues, of which the skill of writing is just a small part: “Who am I and what can I do to be, to better—who am I? What are my skills? And how can I use these skills to make a better life for myself? Give back to my community?” (Participant 3). Participant 5 encourages a fantastical approach to drafting to reveal the current and future selves. His method is the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>They find that using the third-person and objectifying, seeing the self as an objective self as an object, it helps to actually see it as a character. The self becomes a character that they can not only watch their past life play out, but then to invent the future life and let the character go and do. (Participant 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Through fantasy, the student writer envisages a new self and move towards empowerment. Others agree: “Journaling, role-playing, and group discussion” can produce transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541344613485288">Brock, 2010</xref>, p. 124). Ironically, a result of a role-playing self is authenticity. Participant 5 continues, “I just gave her space. As she went, as writing is a process and the discovery of the self, the authentic self, it moved her along” (Participant 5). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541344613485288">Kreber, Klampfleitner, McCune, Bayne, and Knottenbelt (2007)</xref>, authenticity can be understood as “being somehow associated with a sense of empowerment, self-actualization, and individuation, and as such, linked to larger questions of human existence and agency in the world” (p. 25). Consequently, the writer who engages earnestly in the invention of a newly imagined self may experience transformative learning as the old images and stories are exchanged for new interpretations and a more unified self.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1541344613485288">
<title>Wholeness</title>
<p>When a student engages in writing, especially writing to discover the soul in engaged with the unconscious selves, a sense of wholeness results. This wholeness is integrity of parts:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, the word soul to me, it’s not a word I use very often. But if I did, it would mean integrity, and integrity in the sense of moral and ethical character and wholeness. But also integrity in the sense of putting everything together into one thing, into one whole. (Participant 1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Integrity is inherent in the writing process. The unifying effect through truth telling from experience could be the moral and ethical integrity of which he speaks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541344613485288">Poutiatine (2009</xref>) discussed this very process: “Transformation is always a movement towards a greater integrity of identity—a movement toward wholeness” (p. 193). Soul work, then, should be viewed as the transformative process leading to a more cohesive being. The more cohesive student may view the college English experience as part of the rest of life, not a separated compartment. There is no class; the school/life boundaries fade. Participant 3 elaborated in the following passage:
<disp-quote>
<p>Without looking at how does this [class connect], how does this English classroom pertain to your life when you walk out that door. Without that then I think, then it’s just, like I think belittling the student, belittling the whole college experience because it’s not just [about the] surface level. (Participant 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Without the connection of whole students to the whole of experience, the college students of English may lack the materials required for transformative learning experiences. The college experience, then, results in narrow thinking, part by separated part, rule by separated rule, person by separated person.</p>
<p>Vulnerability leads to unity: “It is time for us to stop living a divided life, and the time has to come for us to acknowledge that we cannot be perfect and that we need to bring our whole selves to the classroom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344613485288">Shahjahan, 2004</xref>, p. 303). Practicing precision is essential for practical communication, but allowing for risks and mistakes is necessary for change. The worker of the soul in English classes concerns him or herself with integrity. An assignment is life itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1541344613485288">
<title>Voice</title>
<p>When students with stronger integrity of self sense a freedom to express, a new voice responds. One teacher remembers her first encounters with students: “I was getting a lot of unsatisfactory writing in Composition I, and I couldn’t understand why people of that age—or rather, I could understand why people of that age were unable to have a real voice” (Participant 2). She concluded that these students lacked the requisite outlook to have any idea about their knowledge and potential. The myths and images of themselves were stories and descriptions obscured and disempowered by parental or authoritative abuse. These early negative experiences impact communication: “We need to understand that language in itself can be disempowering and inaccessible to those who are marginalized, and having no access to such language can cause a spiritual scar in students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344613485288">Shahjahan, 2004</xref>, p. 303). A teacher may bring to light the myth working as the scar in a learner in the attempt to allow the whole person to connect to the writing. One teacher described the process of her own experience of finding a voice:
<disp-quote>
<p>The teacher wrote some complimentary thing about how this was exactly how an English paper should be written because it was my soul. And I think that was the first time I found my real voice ever, in my life probably, that paper, because it seemed like later when I got into creative writing after that, it was always that voice I would find in me. (Participant 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The very acknowledgement of forces of oppression opens many learners’ voices to sing with authenticity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344613485288">Cranton and Wright (2008</xref>) elaborate on the transformation of words as negative means to words as empowering forces:
<disp-quote>
<p>Silenced learners often live with violence and in conditions where words are used as weapons rather than as a way to communicate ideas. In connected discussion, people listen deeply and respectfully in order to draw out others’ ideas, thereby giving voice to those who were not previously heard. (p. 45)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The sticks and stones of a learner’s past experience must be acknowledged to allow oppressive actions to birth redemptive words.</p>
<p>Hierarchical homogenizing structures oppress learners’ voices as well. Opposed to the stance that composition students should write only academic and objective papers, one teacher reasons, “I think authentic writing has the power of the human voice behind it” (Participant 5). His idea emphasizes the power of authenticity in the development of a human voice. Teachers who appear inauthentic have students who model inauthentic writing. According to Freire (1971), “The teacher’s thinking is authenticated only by the authenticity of the students’ thinking” (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541344613485288">Kreber, Klampfleitner, McCune, Bayne, &amp; Knottenbelt, 2007</xref>, p. 29). The reasons why teachers of English find it best not to allow the prime conditions for authentic voices vary. Participant 5 questions one motivating force:
<disp-quote>
<p>This could be an assumption, and maybe it’s unfair, that teachers that don’t respect narrative for students to seek out their authentic voices, their real lives, and move toward expository writing, research writing, the writing that presents itself as objective, analytical. I ask, “Are you doing that because you don’t want to know the other?” (Participant 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>If one desires to know, opportunities exist to discover hidden assumptions presented in the myths of tradition, perfection, college preparation, and equality in education, and through images of standardized language, professorship, proximity to learners, and literacy. Nonetheless, students’ voices can rise through these monoliths too.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1541344613485288">
<title>Awareness</title>
<p>The final relationship in this study within the major theme “Response” is awareness. One teacher concludes that awareness is not just alertness but connection with the soul in experience, those collected in the consciousness of time. He describes the awareness:
<disp-quote>
<p>The soul, if that’s what it sounds like, [is] an awareness. What you get tuned into. It is, it’s just the—it’s the ultimate awareness. It’s a sense of maybe the transcendence of the experience, just being, boy, acutely aware of the other, whatever the other is. (Participant 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Just “being” in experience and becoming aware of the other is individuation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344613485288">Cranton and Wright (2008</xref>) position individuation at the center of the transformative learning experience: Individuation is “central to the literacy learner’s transformative experience, as is the role of imagination” (p. 35). Tuning into the soul of the experience leads to individuation, the awareness of self and other. My students often express themselves with a tireless energy during this experience, like a detective nearing a solution.</p>
<p>Centering a learner for awareness and individuation occurs with identifiable processes. Leading a student toward the center requires “compassion, forgiveness, and lots of tolerance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344613485288">Shahjahan, 2004</xref>, p. 300). In short, college professors help students toward awareness by allowing them to risk becoming themselves and assisting them on the written journey with patience and empathy. Perhaps, as one teacher describes, the very mention of professorial support could be made more explicit in the English classroom as a way of centering for awareness. He recalls, “Fifteen, 16 years old, and I really wasn’t aware that anybody was really trying to help me except my coaches” (Participant 6). Coaches are aware that players must make mistakes as they risk and stretch. Writing coaches must allow room for risk and awareness by being explicit about their understanding of the writing student’s symbiotic journey through course and life.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The experiences of these six community college teachers illuminate soul work in English classes as a “Call,” “Movement,” and “Response” relationship that leads to transformative learning. When the relationship described here is the primary method of engaging students in meaningful writing and thinking, learners sense mystery within themselves that they somehow recognize as urgent and connected to their personal journey. Immediately, the future holds greater promise for them in integrity and awareness, in writing and thinking product, and in identity. Teachers who call students to this transformative landscape through writing may find themselves more amenable to surface errors in light of larger gains. The transformation encouraged in soul work through writing is the change of selves from heavy, perhaps even guilt-laden to connection-hungry and free. The creativity and focus in a written product grows when the identity of the writer coheres.</p>
<p>Students, like the one who responded to a reading about a sculpture, attest to this relationship. In her case, all relationship themes exist. Her personal engagement with the metaphor presented led her to the transformative landscape where she faced cognitive dissonance and potential truth through the reinterpretation of prior experiences. She became conscious of something beyond the surface and had been freed in class to pursue this leading for a possible creation. As a class, we dialogued, which allowed her the personal space to share the fascinating details from her trip. The image itself had already posed questions about why it mattered, but as a class we questioned her discovery when she returned. As she heard something of value in the reading, she remembered after the trip that the details surrounding the symbol of the sculpture were personally meaningful. The symbol and her journey to it led to an awakening of hidden pain. Struggling, she moved away to analyze the symbol, the destination, and deeper meanings unforeseen to her, but encouraged by me and her unconscious mind. As a response, she changed as she found a missing piece of her past. She connected then more completely to me, to the material, to herself, and to the other students. Her disparate selves congealed and spread to learn, and her integrity solidified as she saw a chance to author her life. The new voice she brought was calm and the trailhead in healing of emotional and spiritual scars. This awareness of soul-level communication led to the recognition of the potential for soul work in educational environments, even English classes, for her and for us.</p>
<p>The confluence of holistic learning, soul work, and transformative learning deserves more exploration, for it appears evident that a charged educational environment—one safe for emotional and other extrarational experience—and a purposeful journeying through Dirkx’s soul work can lead to an integrity of intrapersonal and interpersonal minds. Future research might focus on possible relationships between teachers’ use of their own extrarational experiences in the classrooms and students’ responses to the “Call” of this study. Also, perhaps an important connection exists between the appearance of a soul work “Response” and an individuating synchronicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541344613485288">Coleman &amp; Beitman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541344613485288">Coleman, Beitman, &amp; Celebi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541344613485288">Costin, Dzara, &amp; Resch, 2011</xref>), for the Jungian synchronistic event relies on one’s emotional state and awakened psyche in a search for meaning.</p>
