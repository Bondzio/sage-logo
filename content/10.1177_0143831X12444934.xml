<abstract>
<p>There is an ongoing sociological debate regarding which work activities can be considered ‘skilled’. In recent years, this debate has become increasingly controversial due to the growing prominence of so-called ‘soft skills’, especially when used in interactive service work. This article seeks to strengthen the conceptualization of soft skills, through case study investigation, to determine whether or not they are worthy of the ‘skilled’ label. An expanded notion of skill is supported, recognizing that in service contexts displaying employer-facilitated worker discretion and requirements for contextual knowledge in the use of soft skills, the term can indeed have real meaning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The nature of skills – their formation and utilization – has been one of the core issues for the sociology of work and indeed for sociology more widely given the implications for public policy on education and social inequality. Many economies now rely on service-based occupational structures and expansion in low-level service jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X12444934">Appelbaum et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X12444934">Gatta et al., 2009</xref>). Given the nature of such occupations popular conceptions of ‘skill’ have moved away from the traditional concern with trades, and their associated technical knowledge, job control and extended training (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X12444934">Braverman, 1974</xref>). There has instead been considerable focus on what are commonly termed ‘soft skills’, which are seen as essential across service organizations, especially in customer-jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X12444934">Grugulis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143831X12444934">Nickson et al., 2005</xref>). Soft skills involve dealing with others and managing oneself and one’s emotions in a manner consistent with particular workplaces and organizations. Within this article we define soft skills as: non-technical and not reliant on abstract reasoning, involving interpersonal and intrapersonal abilities to facilitate mastered performance in particular contexts.</p>
<p>This shift in focus has only reconfigured and extended conceptual and empirical divides on what skill and skilled work is and is not. In recent years, the most complex and contentious issue is that of the character and content of soft skills, to the extent of questioning whether such skills are worthy of the ‘skilled’ label, or are just a meaningless ‘humpty dumpty’ term. This term is used because of the tendency of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X12444934">Lewis Carroll’s (1998 [1872]</xref>) Humpty Dumpty to nonsensically use words exactly as he pleased, regardless of their actual meaning.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to strengthen the conceptual understanding of soft skills through an examination of how these skills are used in different contexts, concentrating on customer-facing hotel workers. Even among sociologists who differ in their interpretation of whether or not soft skills should be considered skills, there is agreement that skill cannot be discussed without reference to the work in which these skills are used (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X12444934">Bolton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X12444934">Gatta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X12444934">Grugulis and Vincent, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X12444934">Hampson and Junor, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X12444934">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12444934">Lloyd and Payne, 2009</xref>). However, such accounts do not satisfactorily resolve the conceptual confusion around soft skills, as they do not systematically examine how dimensions of skill are played out in differing organizational contexts. Instead, the tendency is to imply that work reliant on soft skills is either ubiquitously skilled (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X12444934">Bolton, 2004</xref>) or unskilled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12444934">Lloyd and Payne, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This article seeks to add nuance and depth to the soft skills debate and in doing so extend our understanding of when it may and may not be appropriate to describe work reliant on soft skills as skilled work. It begins with a brief account of the debates surrounding the conceptual and policy paradoxes concerning soft skills in particular, and skill more generally, before discussing the analytical framework used within this article. It then presents empirical data on soft skill formation and utilization from within the interactive service sector, specifically from two hotel establishments. These distinct contexts are used to illustrate the relevance and interplay of worker-, job- and contextually-based notions of soft skill, and suggest the need for an expanded understanding of skilled work.</p>

<title>Skill paradoxes and the risk of the ‘humpty dumpty’ effect</title>
<p>Contrasting perceptions of the changing content and boundaries of skill exist even among like-minded communities such as labour process researchers, and this can be illustrated in a volume from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143831X12444934">Warhurst et al. (2004)</xref>. Its title – <italic>The Skills That Matter</italic> – was in fact hotly contested. The introduction set out some of the key issues and tried to take a balanced view. Traditional ‘technical’ definitions of skill may be being superseded as new categories of what are variously called generic, core or basic skills emerge, which include recognition of soft or social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X12444934">Grugulis et al., 2004</xref>). The authors note, however, that, ‘many of these “new” skills are similar and most are problematic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X12444934">2004</xref>: 6) in terms of whether or not they fit established conceptions of ‘skill’.</p>
<p>In the same volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X12444934">Bolton (2004)</xref> takes a positive view of soft skills and employs two types of argument in favour of describing ‘emotion workers’ as skilled workers. Bolton defines emotion workers as those who regulate their own and others’ feelings as a core job competence through ‘excitement, calm, deference, congeniality and even persuasion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X12444934">Bolton, 2004</xref>: 19). Such workers are thus germane, given the emphasis on interpersonal and intrapersonal abilities in our earlier definition of soft skills. First, Bolton utilizes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X12444934">Littler’s (1982</xref>: 18) conception of skill to make a conventional claim that emotion work contains ‘recognisable elements of discretionary content, task variety and employee control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X12444934">Bolton, 2004</xref>: 32). Second, she argues that even when employers design jobs to constrain skills and script performance, emotion workers have to develop reflexive self-awareness of their social skills and make choices about how and where to deploy them. This argument builds on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X12444934">Bolton’s (2000)</xref> ‘four Ps’ of organizational emotion management: ‘pecuniary’ (emotion work performed for commercial gain to the employer, more correctly termed emotional <italic>labour</italic>); ‘prescriptive’ (performed so as to be consistent with organizational or professional rules of conduct); ‘presentational’ (performed in accordance with general social rules); and ‘philanthropic’ (given as a ‘gift’ to the recipient). Thus, for example, even where employers try to remove skill through prescriptive emotion management to meet pecuniary ends (as in many interactive service workplaces) a worker may still use their wider knowledge of presentational emotion management to depart from organizational prescriptions and skilfully adapt to situations as they occur. Such action may also involve philanthropically gifting emotional exchanges to service recipients that contradict organizational rules.</p>
<p>Bolton’s concept of ‘multi-skilled’ emotion workers is applied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X12444934">Jenkins et al. (2010</xref>: 561) to a high commitment, mass customized call centre setting in which management capitalized on the knowledgeability and the ‘skilfully deployed different emotional performances’ of workers. Supportive claims can also be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X12444934">Hampson et al. (2009</xref>: 52), who argue that ‘thinned-out’, behavioural definitions of ‘quality customer service’ from management cannot deal with the unpredictability and variability of customer interactions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X12444934">Hampson and Junor’s (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X12444934">2010</xref>) related discussion of interactive service work as articulation work puts more emphasis on overall and interconnected processes of learning over time. They argue that much of the skill in articulation work lies in workers maintaining the ‘fragile social order’ between management, customers and themselves, while sometimes also simultaneously negotiating technology. Much of this work is said to be invisible and, importantly, non-routine. Taking all these points together, the conclusion of such arguments appears to be that even the most routine of jobs involving emotion work, or other soft skills, have some elements of uncertainty, complexity, variety and discretion that require more than spontaneous, natural qualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X12444934">Bolton, 2004</xref>: 28).</p>
<p>In <italic>The Skills That Matter</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X12444934">Lafer (2004)</xref> offers the most sceptical view of the nature and employer use of soft skills. Academic and managerial references to the need for potential employees to demonstrate appropriate grooming, enthusiasm, positive attitudes and willingness to turn up on time and follow instructions are less soft skills than behavioural requirements. Such behavioural requirements are neither new, nor distinguishable from the standard requirements of the discipline of wage labour and Lafer goes on to argue that, ‘such qualities are measures of commitment that one chooses to give or withhold based on the conditions of work offered’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X12444934">2004</xref>: 118).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12444934">Lloyd and Payne (2009)</xref> make an explicit attack. They highlight the practical and analytical dangers of conflating social competencies with ‘real’ skills, and relabelling as ‘skills’ what in the past may have been considered personal attributes, dispositions or behaviours. Such a shift may also allow employers to undermine the expertise of groups of employees, as in the housing benefit caseworkers studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X12444934">Grugulis and Vincent (2009)</xref>, where soft skills were promoted as an alternative to existing ‘technical’ knowledge. Payne also raises the question of whether it is even possible to train the ‘genuine empathy and compassion’ that underlies soft skills given that these are ‘deeply wired in the brain through a combination of genetic imprinting and primary socialisation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X12444934">2006</xref>: 20). These concerns highlight the risk of divesting the concept of skill of any real meaning, and turning it into a redundant ‘humpty dumpty’ term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X12444934">Oliver and Turton, 1982</xref>: 198), as described in the introduction to this article. Furthermore, meaningless extensions of the concept of skill allow policy-makers to make hollow claims about universal upskilling in a new economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12444934">Lloyd and Payne, 2009</xref>). After considering the contradictory perceptions of skill among managers and workers in their call centre case study, Lloyd and Payne conclude by defending a more traditional concept of skill that retains a ‘a clear link to technical competence and knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12444934">2009</xref>: 631).</p>
<p>Both the negative and positive views of soft skill have limitations. On the positive side, merely identifying emotion work, cognitive or communication processes does not necessarily mean that they are taking place in a context of skilled work. While Bolton’s use of ‘multi-skilled emotion workers’ is directed towards describing the variety of demands and practices that arise from the emotional effort bargain, it is too loose, and multi-skilled is not the same as a skilled job – it frequently implies fragmented tasks and competencies. In general terms, the logic appears to be that as managing emotions appropriately is a skill, then all emotion workers are skilled workers. The fact that employers cannot design jobs that completely eliminate uncertainty and variety, or that workers choose to fill gaps in service delivery via their soft skills, does not make a job de facto skilled. We have to have a means of distinguishing between and among various kinds of soft skills and their utilization. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X12444934">Grugulis et al. (2004)</xref> note, many workers have little discretion about the form emotional and aesthetic labour should take and product knowledge in many service contexts, such as retail, is minimal.</p>
<p>The central problem with negative views of soft skills is that while the critique of ambiguous positions and hollow claims is persuasive, their own conceptual ground is, in some respects, shaky. The term ‘technical’ skill is too wedded to the experience of trades with defined bodies of knowledge. It is neither descriptively robust nor versatile enough to handle contemporary questions of skill and skill formation in a largely service-based economy. Employers are seeking qualities in labour power that it did not do, or do extensively or intensively, previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X12444934">Thompson and Smith, 2009</xref>). Our definitions and understandings of skill must reflect that.</p>

<title>Reconciling the conceptual dimensions of skill</title>
<p>Though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X12444934">Grugulis et al. (2004)</xref> do not reach any definitive conclusions, their invoking of a ‘consensus’ approach to defining skill is useful. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X12444934">Cockburn’s (1983)</xref> widely used dimensions of skill, they distinguish between the skill that resides in the worker; the skill that is required in the job; and socially constructed skill through which economic actors utilize power resources to define skill content and determine outcomes. Such a threefold conceptualization considers that skilled work depends not only on the level of a person’s ability, but also the work, organizational and social context in which skills are deployed. Despite the potential analytical power of Cockburn’s typology, neither <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X12444934">Grugulis et al. (2004)</xref> nor other studies of interactive service work citing Cockburn (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12444934">Lloyd and Payne, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X12444934">McBride et al., 2005</xref>) systematically analyse soft skills using her dimensions of skill. If we apply these dimensions to soft skills and engage with a wider range of literature, what, therefore, might we get?</p>
<p>Defined as a quality of individuals, within the individual differences psychology literature, skill is what is required of workers for performing a specific task and describes processes leading to relevant performance in particular situations. Fundamentally, skill develops over time, with practice; involves cognitive processes and manipulation of knowledge, both ‘knowing-that’ (declarative knowledge) and ‘know-how’ (procedural knowledge); and includes an element of discretion that allows performance with economy of effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X12444934">Kanfer and Ackerman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X12444934">Proctor and Dutta, 1995</xref>). Soft skills encompass a range of interpersonal, self-management and service orientation skills, often referred to collectively as social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X12444934">Peterson et al., 2001</xref>), which facilitate performance across job contexts involving social interactions. Some have conceptualized social skills as overlapping with personality traits like empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X12444934">Nezlek et al., 2001</xref>), but most recent approaches emphasize their learned nature, which allows them to be acquired through training and experience, and distinguishes them from stable personality constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X12444934">Hogan and Shelton, 1998</xref>). As a personal quality, social skill reflects knowledge combined with experientially learned responses to environmental cues, as well as a willingness to exert effort towards displaying a particular response (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X12444934">Klein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X12444934">Meichenbaum et al., 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, soft skill requirements in the job can be found in the labour power strategies and practices of employers, manifested primarily in recruitment, selection, training and work organization. This includes the structure of the work itself (e.g. the need for social skill or the degree of social interdependence required); the wider work context (e.g. incentives or support structures for displaying soft skills or providing cues about their value); and recruitment, selection and training practices (which condition what is considered effective performance in social settings and encourage or constrain expression of particular personal attributes in work performance). Definitions of soft skill that focus on the work itself show that skilled performance depends on an interaction between the person and the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X12444934">Hochwarter et al., 2006</xref>). In highly prescribed environments, workers have limited scope in determining how they should apply their social skills, behaviour that is also reinforced by the reward structure. Greater worker control, however, allows more role flexibility and hence greater motivation to try out and master new tasks. Again, this emphasizes that soft skills are not purely fixed personal attributes, but are context-specific. Work organization and employer actions play a role in allowing skill to be displayed or acquired through practice, and subsequently performed with economy of effort in order to reach what might be called skilled performance. However, where high levels of prescription and codification occur, as in the case of organizational feeling rules, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X12444934">Bolton, 2000</xref>), less individual ‘skill’ may be required. ‘Mastery’ is, therefore, not simply an outcome of the predispositions of individual actors, and soft skills may be more adaptive and ‘trainable’ than some commentators believe.</p>
<p>Third, soft skills exist through the varied social constructions of economic actors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X12444934">Cockburn’s (1983)</xref> original emphasis was on the power to define what is worthy of being labelled as skilled work, illustrated through the manner in which patriarchal societies value (masculine) manual work more highly than ‘female’ work. Such social constructions caution us with respect to the coded meanings in employers’ use of soft skills, for instance, in hiring practices, where attributes such as attitude or interpersonal skill are used to justify decisions based more on tractability or obedience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X12444934">Lafer, 2004</xref>). Social construction of soft skills can even directly discriminate, as, for example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X12444934">Moss and Tilly’s (1996)</xref> finding that some US employers automatically profiled young black men as not possessing soft skills or work readiness. The power inherent in social construction also has implications for assessment of economic policy, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12444934">Lloyd and Payne (2009</xref>: 631) highlighting how expanding notions of skill have been carelessly used by UK governments in a discourse of ‘universal upskilling’, which ignores the skills content of many service sector jobs.</p>
<p>In summary, therefore, some workers will be able to demonstrate better soft skills than others, partly because of what they bring to the work situation; partly as a result of the requirements, constraints and opportunities of that situation; and also as a reflection of which particular skills are valued.</p>
<p>How might these distinctions inform an expanded definition of skill? In <italic>The Nature of Work</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X12444934">Thompson (1989)</xref> defined skill as ‘knowledgeable practice within elements of control’. In other words, skill referred primarily to knowledge, applied effectively under conditions of discretion, in a work context. Such discretion need not imply total autonomy, but is instead a sliding scale of the degree of control workers have over how they conduct their job. Building on conceptualizations of skill as a combination of cognitive, knowledge-based and dispositional attributes, but also context-dependent and experientially developed, we could argue that this applies equally well to soft skills. Returning to the call centre example, if management in mass service call centres trained employees to have substantive knowledge of products and allowed discretion in word and deed, that could then be described as skilled work, a situation reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X12444934">Jenkins et al. (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>Analytically, this perspective would mean that soft skills in themselves do not constitute skilled work. It is when they are combined with knowledge and discretion that a potential is created. A good example is problem-solving, which can be complex or relatively routine depending upon the context and engagement with bodies of knowledge. Furthermore, it is not enough to refer only to ‘the skill in the person’, such as when call centre or other workers ‘philanthropically’ donate emotion work outwith, or against, managerial prescriptions (as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X12444934">Callaghan and Thompson, 2002</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X12444934">Bolton, 2004</xref>). While that may be skilled <italic>behaviour</italic>, it is not skilled work and could even simply reflect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X12444934">Bolton’s (2000)</xref> category of socially expected ‘presentational’ emotion management. For example, it would seem counter-intuitive to redefine a fast food context as skilled, just because some employees are prepared to depart from a script. This distinction removes the fear that, in Lloyd and Payne’s words, soft skills ‘float freely across a vast sea of human behaviours’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12444934">2009</xref>: 631). Focusing solely on call centres and other interactive service work can, however, be misleading. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X12444934">Lafer (2004)</xref> notes, ‘interactive skills’ also include mentoring, negotiating, instructing, supervising and persuading. Though it is beyond the scope of this article, higher-level interpersonal skills should be included in analytical frameworks, and are argued to be important qualities for effective performance across job contexts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X12444934">Marks and Scholarios, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143831X12444934">Riggio et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143831X12444934">Witt and Ferris, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The conceptualization of skill proposed here also has policy implications. Most of the perceived skills deficits reported by British employers reflect the oft-heard argument that employees across the occupational spectrum are not ‘work-ready’ because they lack literacy and numeracy, work discipline and personal, problem-solving, communication and teamwork skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143831X12444934">Westwood, 2004</xref>: 40). The blame game in public policy is directed towards the individual or other ‘suppliers’ such as the family and education system, as evidenced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X12444934">Moss and Tilly’s (1996)</xref> account of soft skills and young black workers in entry-level jobs. If we accept that skills are, in part, in the person, then such factors must feature in the explanation. But if soft and other skills are also, and we would argue, primarily, determined in the labour process, then we have to base our explanations in the employment relationship as well as employability, in demand as well as supply. We now explore these analytical and policy issues around the conceptualization of soft skills in two case studies, each representing different work contexts for the utilization of soft skill.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X12444934">Cockburn’s (1983)</xref> three dimensions of skill identified in the literature – as residing in the individual, as residing in the job context and as social construction – were used as an analytical framework for exploring the formation and utilization of soft skills in two, anonymized, hotel case studies – ‘Fontainebleau’ and ‘Oxygen’. Both hotels were located in Glasgow and were part of international chains – Fontainebleau was a four star hotel employing approximately 135 staff and Oxygen a five star hotel employing approximately 220 staff. Both catered for the business, events and leisure markets although Oxygen was positioned more towards the business market and Fontainebleau the leisure market. The largest occupational group in the hotels was elementary staff (including, for example, bar and waiting staff, housekeepers and junior kitchen positions) categories of workers, who are typically low paid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X12444934">Siebern-Thomas, 2005</xref>) and traditionally classified as low skilled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X12444934">Gatta et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These case studies were chosen to represent an industry in which soft skills are regarded as important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X12444934">Grugulis, 2006</xref>) and to reflect what is often referred to as a ‘low’ skill setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X12444934">Gatta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X12444934">Grugulis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X12444934">Payne, 2006</xref>) in order to interrogate the true level of skill required. The two hotel establishments were selected using the 2004 Scottish Employers Skills Survey (SESS) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X12444934">FSS, 2005</xref>). In order to obtain an intra-industry comparison of different skills contexts in ostensibly similar work from this aggregated sampling frame, the hotels were differentiated depending on whether or not managers reported soft skills gaps in their staff (i.e. that some members of staff were not fully proficient in their work). Fontainebleau reported such gaps at the time of the 2004 survey and Oxygen did not. The case studies were further filtered to represent multi-site establishments employing over 100 employees and drawing from the same labour market.</p>
<p>A mixed methods approach using surveys, interviews and focus groups was used. The analysis reported here draws predominantly on qualitative data, supplemented by survey data where appropriate. The decision to prioritize the qualitative data is commensurate with our aim to examine alternative notions of skill, as a property of the individual, as contained in employer/work practices and as the social constructions of economic actors. The contested nature of soft skills that this proposes requires a qualitative approach to understand the perceptions, social processes and contextual influences brought to bear on these skills. Indeed the analysis that follows highlights marked differences in actors’ perceptions of soft skill in different contexts.</p>
<p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the HR representative in each establishment alongside line managers responsible for each major employee group (such as, for example, food and beverage [F and B], housekeeping, kitchen, front office [reception] and the hotels’ management teams). These were ‘key’ respondents who were in the best position to comment upon the policies and practices of each establishment. To gain an understanding of employees’ perceptions of their soft skills and relevant organizational practices, non-managerial employee interviews and focus groups were conducted. These interviews were confined to customer-facing staff including those working in F and B, conferences and events and reception, as soft skills are arguably most integral to the work of these employees. Six managers and 12 employees (eight as a focus group) were interviewed in Oxygen and five managers and seven employees were interviewed in Fontainebleau, with staffing issues making it impossible to organize a focus group within Fontainebleau. The surveys were distributed to all managers and employees in each establishment, with back of house workers also included in the survey sample to try and maximize response rates. The realized sample sizes were 29 in Fontainebleau and 50 in Oxygen, translating to response rates of approximately 23%. Given the low survey response rates and the focus on the contested nature of soft skills reported above, the surveys are used here for contextual data only.</p>
<p>Areas covered by the interviews included the skills and attributes sought during recruitment and selection; the skills, attributes and knowledge that were important for employees in their work; the nature of training provision; and work organization. Relevant areas within the surveys reported here include the importance of certain skills to the respondent’s work and training provision.</p>
<p>Our analytical strategy was to use the three notions of skill discussed above to explore soft skill formation and utilization within each case study. The analysis went beyond content analysis, however, to allow a deeper understanding of the nature of soft skills within the given contexts. As the interviews were semi-structured, certain themes of interest were predetermined prior to analysis while emergent themes were latently coded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X12444934">Neuman, 1997</xref>) ‘quasi inductively’ as general patterns emerged from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X12444934">McGuire, 2007</xref>: 128). The findings thus reflect the general patterns that were identified.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The findings from each hotel are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X12444934">Table 1</xref>. This illustrates the status of soft skills in Fontainebleau and Oxygen according to the three dimensions of skill. The first column considers the attributes that managers and employees believed were necessary to do the job; for example, what was sought during recruitment or what employees reported as important on the job. We acknowledge that this is only a partial account of the skills that reside in an individual, but this is consistent with job analytic techniques for identifying worker characteristics, and recognizes also personal characteristics, education and experience. The skills, knowledge and attributes identified in the first column are separate from the manner in which the work <italic>itself</italic> allowed skill to be manifested through work organization, training and the requirement for knowledge (column 2). This distinction between skill identified in the individual and that allowed on the job thus acknowledges that contradictions may be apparent between espoused and actual skill requirements. The third column considers the social construction of skill in each hotel. Social construction is ascertained through the value that each employer placed on soft skills, alongside the manner in which managers constructed certain attributes as ‘skills’. The final column synthesizes the findings of the three elements of skill to suggest categorizations for each hotel.</p>

<title>Worker characteristics perceived as necessary to do the job</title>
<p>As is to be expected of these interactive service settings, the individual attributes emphasized as important for effective performance were consistent with what we recognize as soft skills. Ten of the 11 hotel managers interviewed confirmed that soft skills and personal characteristics were the focus of recruitment. All managers responsible for front-line staff identified interpersonal skills as <italic>the</italic> most important requirement: ‘You can find out if they’re bubbly, they’re cheery . . . obviously if they’re outgoing and whatever you know they’re going to be able to deal with a guest, compared to someone that’s really shy and withdrawn’ (Fontainebleau front office manager).</p>
<p>Fontainebleau managers responsible for customer-facing staff were looking for those who could display a polite and professional air and were ‘presentable’, ‘bright’ and ‘articulate’. In Oxygen the managers whose staff were concentrated in front of house functions were more specific about the type of self-presentation that was sought during recruitment, stating that they were looking for individuals who were ‘warm’, ‘genuine’, ‘articulate’, ‘polished’, ‘eloquent’ and ‘stylish’. Self-presentation, consistent with their ‘style’ brand, was especially important for Oxygen.</p>
<p>Four of the five Fontainebleau managers also identified ‘reliability’ and ‘work ethic’ as important qualities, while the fifth (front office manager) expressed a requirement for ‘maturity and responsibility’. Fontainebleau’s F and B manager looked for people who could ‘hold down a job’ and who were not ‘trouble makers’, while the head chef sought something bordering on obedience for apprentices; ‘eyes open, ears open, mouth shut’. The importance attached to these qualities in Fontainebleau was associated with apparent applicant apathy towards the job at the interview. Oxygen managers, however, attributed any insouciance to applicants’ belief that jobs in the hotel industry were easy to obtain, rather than apathy.</p>
<p>Technical and ‘hard’ skills or specific work experiences were less important in each hotel because of the customer-focused nature of the work, and reserved primarily for managerial positions (e.g. strategic planning), senior chef positions (e.g. the ability to cost a menu) or skilled trades people, such as electricians. There was no specific requirement for work experience for front-line staff. In Fontainebleau, the F and B manager believed that work experience in hospitality produced more cynical employees, and only two of five Fontainebleau managers believed that work experience was beneficial in the development of soft skills. None of the Oxygen managers believed work experience to be especially beneficial. General life experiences (for example travelling and tertiary education) were seen as valuable, with Oxygen managers in particular believing that the social experiences gained from being a student were especially beneficial in the development of soft skills.</p>
<p>The data from managers on the qualities they sought during recruitment and selection were supported by the survey and interview responses of employees. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X12444934">Table 2</xref> shows the three most important skills which employees surveyed in each hotel reported that they used in their daily work. Team working and customer handling were among the most important skills in both hotels, as was oral communication in Oxygen. Soft skills thus dominated the most important skills used by employees in both establishments.</p>

<p>The employee interviews supported the view that soft skills were the most important skills in the hotels, especially dealing with customers, while the requirement for technical skills and knowledge were limited. For example, in Fontainebleau waiting staff received no training in wines while receptionists in both hotels reported that the technical aspect of using the room booking systems was limited as, ‘it’s basically two buttons you need to press’ (Fontainebleau receptionist).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0143831X12444934">
<title>Skill allowed/required on and by the job</title>
<p>Identifying desirable worker attributes, in itself, does not indicate the level of skill truly required or allowed by the work. The first issue is whether despite their stated demand for skills, management actually used selective hiring to identify these qualities. This was not necessarily evident in Fontainebleau, where the HR representative described some managers as making hiring decisions based on the person’s willingness to do the job rather than their appropriate skills. Three of the seven employees interviewed reported that their interviews had been cursory, informal and unstructured, and some had been told that they had the job before the interview. One restaurant employee revealed, ‘He [the restaurant manager] was quite willing to take me on as long as I was happy with what he was offering [in terms of hours and pay]’; while his co-worker believed that at interview managers, ‘were seriously just looking for a pair of hands!’</p>
<p>For these reasons, Fontainebleau’s HR representative had recently restructured the selection process to include two interviews, one with the line manager and one with herself. All managers had also been offered training in competency-based interviewing.</p>
<p>In Oxygen, managers reiterated the importance of always being selective, ‘cherry picking’ the best applicants for all positions (deputy general manager) and never reverting to ‘desperation stakes’ in hiring applicants who did not have the correct skills (F and B manager). Employee data confirmed that interviews had been in-depth and rigorous.</p>
<p>A second, and perhaps more important issue was the organization of work, specifically with respect to soft skills. Here, the two hotels diverged. This is best illustrated through examination of the service encounter. Fontainebleau’s service encounter was dictated by prescribed brand standards which stipulated the exact steps and stages required. This was evident, for example, in front office where each ‘check in’ encounter involved a checklist of behaviours displayed prominently behind the desk. Although employees felt that they were not simply enacting a script and could take time to ‘chat’ with customers if circumstances allowed, there remained specific behaviours that had to be used for each service encounter. The receptionist remarked jokingly that she sometimes felt a bit like a ‘robot’. The waitress and all four conference and banqueting employees also reported that taking a customer’s order and serving at functions was supposed to be done in a strictly regimented sequence in line with the brand standards. This prescription was not only confined to the customer-facing staff. The head chef reported that all dishes were made according to strict protocols with little creative licence allowed.</p>
<p>Fontainebleau’s appearance policy and dress code provide further evidence of the prescribed nature of the work. Staff uniforms were standardized and purchased from an industry clothing supplier. Strict guidelines also existed regarding hair length and style, an absence of facial hair and visible tattoos and the fact that only one pair of earrings and a wedding ring could be worn as jewellery. Employees were not permitted to personalize their uniforms in any way. Overall, therefore, Fontainebleau can be described as a ‘directed’ environment.</p>
<p>In Oxygen, employees had considerably more freedom over their use of soft skills. Rather than prescribed brand standards Oxygen had a clear service philosophy; ‘nae bother’. When discussing this philosophy all employees and managers stated that Oxygen was a very ‘informal’, ‘young’, ‘fresh’ and ‘stylish’ hotel. Oxygen maintained the ‘nae bother’ approach to customer service through genuine friendliness on the part of the employees rather than over-prescription of brand standards. Employees were also encouraged to be polite yet informal with the guests. It was believed that employees should maintain freedom over the service encounter as, ‘You can’t have genuine people if you tell them what to say’ (Oxygen HR representative). Oxygen’s employees supported this high level of discretion:<disp-quote>
<p>Our management won’t come over and say that you shouldn’t have given them, like you were wrong to say that . . . they stick by you . . . if you were to make a decision and management was to come up and say that you shouldn’t have said that, you were wrong to say that, then it makes you feel really rubbish basically, and it makes you look stupid I think. So it’s really good the fact that you’ve got the ability to do that here [act with discretion]. (Oxygen restaurant employee)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In keeping with the empowered ‘nae bother’ philosophy Oxygen employees were allowed discretion in interpreting broad appearance guidelines in a manner consistent with the brand of the hotel. Although employees had a uniform (by a London designer) they were allowed bodily and uniform adornments, ‘crazy’ hairstyles (Focus group respondent 6) and facial hair as long as it was viewed as ‘stylish’, did not contravene health and safety legislation and fit with the style of the Oxygen brand. Oxygen, therefore, can be described as an ‘empowered’ environment.</p>
<p>The third issue that emerged was the nature of training and induction, which followed both the predominant skills requirements and the nature of work organization. Training in Fontainebleau began with a three-day group induction for all new employees. Induction covered company information, the brand, job duties, equal opportunities and health and safety. Much of this initial and subsequent training involved Fontainebleau’s brand standards and the way in which these were to be implemented by employees in the somewhat prescriptive and standardized manner described above. Subsequently, training was offered as and when required to all occupational groups in both soft and hard skills, either on-the-job (often through shadowing) or refresher courses (on customer service and brand standards). In total 93% of Fontainebleau survey respondents reported receiving training in the previous 12 months. When looking at the most widely reported topics of training, 66% of respondents reported receiving health and safety training; 41% reported receiving training in induction, team working, customer service and product knowledge; and 38% in grooming and self-presentation.</p>
<p>Oxygen’s HR representative described induction as a three-day process covering an introduction to the company, ‘statutory stuff’ such as health and safety, customer service and product knowledge. Employees were required to attend the first of these days before starting in the hotel. Oxygen’s ‘nae bother’ empowerment philosophy was strongly emphasized. Employees were also given a free dinner, bed and breakfast stay in the hotel that had to be taken in their probationary period, during which they were treated like any other customer. This free stay in the hotel was specifically included as part of the induction process to familiarize the new employees with the company’s brand from a customer point of view.</p>
<p>Discussion of training activity in Oxygen also focused on the ‘nae bother’ philosophy, especially among the managers who were primarily responsible for customer-facing staff. According to the managers, this was not simply about telling employees what to say and how to say it, but was instead about allowing employees to conduct the service experience, as they felt best, within broad guidelines. For example, employees were informed of the maximum possible offer that they could make in the face of a complaint (free food and beverages and nights in the hotel) but were encouraged to use their initiative to meet customer requirements, in the knowledge that managers were, in the eyes of the HR representative, ‘not bothered’ if someone provided an apparently disproportionate recourse to a complaint. All employees supported managers’ assertions with one reporting that, ‘They [managers] just expect you to do what feels comfortable I think.’ Of the employees surveyed 86% reported receiving some form of training in the past 12 months. The most widely reported training content was in health, safety and first aid and product knowledge (reported by 58%); customer service (42%); and induction and team working (36%). Given the regularity with which ‘nae bother’ training was reportedly conducted, the customer service figure appears low, although as the philosophy was inexorably linked to the hotel’s brand, the extensively reported product knowledge training may also have included ‘nae bother’.</p>
<p>In contrasting the two hotels, it is apparent that each required different degrees of contextual knowledge. Although Fontainebleau exerted considerable effort to ensure employees were familiar with brand standards, they were then subsequently also told, with a fair degree of precision, how they should behave to ensure they were meeting these standards; this reduced the requirement for knowledge. In Oxygen, however, training and induction followed a broader socialization approach allowing employees to develop knowledge of the brand to self-direct their actions accordingly. The high proportion of Oxygen employees reporting training in product knowledge is testament to this point, as was the requirement to familiarize themselves with the brand from a customer’s point of view, during their induction hotel stay. Thus, although the <italic>content</italic> of training followed the primary skills requirements of the hotels (i.e. in soft skills) alongside statutory and health and safety issues, the <italic>nature</italic> of training differed alongside the requirement for contextual knowledge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0143831X12444934">
<title>The social construction of skill</title>
<p>Implicit in the findings so far we can detect the value placed upon soft skills in each establishment and the characteristics considered by managers to be skills. First, soft skills were highly valued as an integral skill set in both hotels. Moreover, when discussing their demand for ‘personality’, managers in both hotels manifested this in terms of the extent to which applicants and employees could interact with people (especially customers), thus apparently taking the form of interpersonal skill. That is not to say, however, that skill was always <italic>allowed</italic> by the job itself.</p>
<p>Within Fontainebleau there was also evidence that some managers, when talking about soft skills, were looking for a willingness to do the job, positive attitudes or even obedience. Although the requirement for such attitudes was also apparent to some extent in Oxygen, these were not viewed as skills in quite the same way. For example, managers in Oxygen did report a problem with a lack of enthusiasm in some staff but reported that the repetitive yet tiring nature of some work, such as housekeeping, meant that this was almost inevitable over time as, ‘housekeeping’s a job which you couldn’t get any more disenchanted with if you do it’ (Oxygen HR representative).</p>
<p>What was apparent in Oxygen was that the demand for style and eloquence was associated with certain class and educational backgrounds, and especially with tertiary education. Indeed, managers responsible for customer-facing staff appeared to be looking for a certain style of speech and deportment that may be seen as reflecting ‘middle-class’ socialization. Oxygen’s front office manager, for example, stated a problem with local non-student applicants who ‘speak very Glasgow’, while the HR respondent believed that as many of the hotel’s business guests were middle class, those from similar backgrounds found it easier to interact with them. Indeed, even employees believed that in order to truly represent Oxygen’s brand people should not come from disadvantaged areas of Glasgow and should be ‘beautifully educated’ (focus group respondent 2). The deputy general manager summed up Oxygen’s demands for erudition and eloquence thus:<disp-quote>
<p>I know I sound like somebody from Hitler Youth, but yes I do [think social background matters] . . . unless people are polished there is no hope for them. And yes we’ll employ them in back of house areas, but then they’re trapped, and they’re not trapped because they’re not capable they’re trapped because they’re not articulate.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While the social construction of skills partially represents the demands of particular contexts, essentially it also represents a power dynamic. Those that determine demand (i.e. employers) have the power to define what is and what is not considered a skill. It is partially this definitional power which risks divesting the concept of skill of real meaning and can also create labour market inequalities, as is discussed below.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section9-0143831X12444934" sec-type="discussion|conclusions">
<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>The authors agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12444934">Lloyd and Payne (2009</xref>: 630) that a ‘much more demanding definition of skilled work’ is needed than is sometimes offered in new debates on skill in interactive service settings. The aim of this article was to strengthen the conceptual understanding of soft skills through an examination of how these skills are used in different contexts, concentrating on customer-facing hotel workers. Such a strengthening is essential given the limitations of traditional, technical notions of skill in a service economy. If one accepts that skill reflects the appropriate application of knowledge over time and within context (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X12444934">Proctor and Dutta, 1995</xref>), as well as the discretion to practise this knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X12444934">Thompson, 1989</xref>), we must examine the extent to which particular contexts truly allow ‘skilled’ behaviour.</p>
<p>The two interactive service case study contexts examined here represented contrasting environments in terms of the specific nature of demand for soft skills and the influence of work organization and employer practices on the emergence of skill. Employees were allowed significantly more control over their labour process in Oxygen than Fontainebleau, with Oxygen employees also requiring a greater degree of contextual knowledge in order to conduct their work skilfully.</p>
<p>The comparison between the two hotels suggests that despite similar espoused demand for soft skills, the contexts allowed different degrees of skilled performance. Fontainebleau’s service encounter was reduced to fragmented behaviours limiting the extent to which soft skills were required at all for effective performance. Managers’ apparent demand for social and interpersonal skills was not reflected in the arbitrary recruitment process or the organization of work. Fontainebleau employees did report that they could depart from strict prescriptions and interact socially with customers if time allowed, possibly representing ‘philanthropic’ emotional ‘gift’ donations or simply ‘presentational’ emotion management in line with expected social norms of behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X12444934">Bolton, 2000</xref>). Work in Fontainebleau, nonetheless, was organized to allow little discretion in the interpretation of brand standards, which were rigorously prescribed through induction and training. Fontainebleau, thus, may partially represent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X12444934">Bolton’s (2000)</xref> combination of ‘prescriptive’ emotion management in order to fulfil ‘pecuniary’ emotional labour. However, Fontainebleau’s directed environment did not just relate to emotion management but also to physical self-presentation and other elements of the labour process, including those unrelated to soft skills. Furthermore, we may expect most organizations to have some form of prescriptive emotion management in place (e.g. even Oxygen had some loose and amorphous feeling and display rules) but it is the <italic>degree</italic> of prescription and discretion that are important factors in considering whether a work environment can be described as ‘skilled’, moving beyond the concept of prescriptive emotion management. Little knowledge was required in Fontainebleau as actions were tightly controlled. Furthermore, there were clearly occasions where managerial demand for ‘skills’ constituted little more than a requirement for enthusiasm, work ethic and even obedience. Such a demand reflects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X12444934">Lafer’s (2004)</xref> concerns that soft skills may effectively be used as a way of expressing a demand for discipline and submissiveness. There were inconsistencies, therefore, in the level of skill socially constructed through management rhetoric and the reality of the job itself, with management definitions of skill lacking any significant conceptual meaning. Fontainebleau can thus be characterized as a ‘low skill’ environment.</p>
<p>Oxygen, in contrast, provided a high discretion environment both for self-expression (the aesthetic and emotional labour of service performance) and for delivery of the service brand, reinforcing this with product (brand) knowledge through induction, training and other socialization processes. In terms of opportunities for skilled performance, Oxygen expected the presence of certain interpersonal qualities and service orientation at the recruitment stage, and selected individuals accordingly. They also provided the means for the translation of knowledge into skilled action by providing discretion and the motivation for this to happen. Skill in customer service in this particular hotel became attainable with greater economy of effort through the application, over time, of knowledge of the brand, the customer and how best to accommodate service needs. Essentially, the discretion that Oxygen employees were allowed was explicitly built into the work context by management and went beyond the philanthropic or presentational emotional exchanges evident in Fontainebleau. While no managerial regime will ever completely remove worker discretion, there is a vast difference between informally initiated employee action as they chafe against scripts and other boundaries of control, and substantive, formal discretion designed into work by management.</p>
<p>Conventional notions of skilled performance may thus define Oxygen as a ‘high skill’ environment, at least for customer-facing employees. This description remains even with the relative absence of any technological demands, which, where they existed, were minimal for front-line workers, as they were in Fontainebleau. This does not, however, mean that employees (particularly in front-desk positions) may not have sometimes had to negotiate the demands of technology while simultaneously trying to appease both the customer and organizational agents, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X12444934">Hampson and Junor’s (2005)</xref> articulation work. Technology itself did not, however, contribute to skilled work in these contexts and, if anything, operated as a deskilling device (for example, generic room booking systems and kitchen protocols). We would argue, therefore, that soft skills alone can constitute skilled work in the absence of complex technological demands, but such requirements do <italic>not</italic> constitute skilled work in the absence of discretion and the need for contextual knowledge.</p>
<p>One caveat was that Oxygen managers perceived those from middle-class backgrounds and certain educational institutions to possess a ‘polish’ that was linked to skill, thus risking the conflation of social advantage with skill. Oxygen managers demanded a manifestation of cultural capital in their employees, which has been linked previously with middle-class socialization and subsequent success in the employment sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X12444934">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>). It may be that those from more affluent backgrounds simply have the access to the resources needed to develop and practise these abilities outside the workplace in a number of settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X12444934">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X12444934">Brown and Hesketh, 2004</xref>), which heightened the chance of being able to skilfully adapt to Oxygen’s environment. This advantage alone does not, therefore, nullify the argument that these remain skills. The caution remains nonetheless that employer demand for soft skills may privilege those from certain class backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X12444934">Hurrell and Scholarios, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X12444934">Nickson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X12444934">Payne, 2006</xref>), which may eventually require intervention in the form of government social inclusion policy.</p>
<p>Taken together, the evidence suggests that considerable heterogeneity exists in the amount of skill allowed, even in ostensibly similar work. Just as it is incorrect, therefore, to refer to all interactive service work as equally highly skilled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X12444934">Payne, 2006</xref>) it is also incorrect to describe all interactive service work as <italic>un</italic>skilled and devoid of discretion. We thus concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X12444934">Hampson and Junor (2005)</xref> that low-level service work is not ubiquitously routine, repetitive and tightly controlled. It is also incorrect to state that just because employers minimize discretion in some settings, workers themselves necessarily lack skill; rather, in certain contexts the potential to display skill is designed out of the job and workers’ skill, therefore, may remain latent.</p>
<p>The variability in employer-facilitated discretion as with the variability in people’s ability to perform such skills may indeed add extra weight to the argument that soft skills are skills. If similar service work settings can be delineated into those that are more and less skilled, the true degree to which individuals can really display skill can be assessed. Once the requirement for knowledge is added to this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X12444934">Thompson, 1989</xref>) the argument that soft skills can indeed be skills in certain contexts is strengthened further.</p>
<p>In terms of the conceptualization of soft skill it is perhaps, therefore, heterogeneity in individual ability, work organization and knowledge requirements which offers an effective riposte to those who doubt that these are actually skills (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12444934">Lloyd and Payne, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X12444934">Payne, 2006</xref>). Individuals’ qualities brought to the job are transformed into skills on the job, with the level of ‘skill’ indicated by whether they have mastered a particular context. Of course, where employees are tightly controlled with little requirement for knowledge, this mastery requires considerably less skill than in establishments where greater discretion and knowledge are required. As such, soft skills are not only distinct from inherent traits and attitudes, as has already been acknowledged by others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X12444934">Meichenbaum et al., 1981</xref>), but are also more than individualized learned abilities.</p>
<p>That is not to say that considerable caution should not be applied when assessing employer demand for skill in interactive service settings, as the manner in which skills are socially constructed can indeed bear the risk of turning skill into a meaningless ‘humpty dumpty’ word. Some employers classify a generic requirement for positive attitudes and even submissiveness as skill, which can in fact be used to reinforce compliance within low skill settings, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X12444934">Lafer (2004)</xref>. Furthermore, it is also evident from the research presented here that where some interactive service employers espouse a demand for skill, this is then not reinforced by either their selectiveness of potential employees nor the true degree of skill actually required on the job.</p>
<p>Caution in interpreting skills demand also has policy implications. If some employers are seeking compliance (socially constructed as ‘soft skills’) in low skill settings, alongside questionable employment conditions, then responsibility for addressing any associated skills deficits should not rest with the government. Given that employers have proved proficient at shifting the blame for skills shortages onto the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143831X12444934">Westwood, 2004</xref>), for example through vocational education and training, government needs to carefully assess the exact nature of skills demand before responding to employer wishes. Second, if some jobs upon closer inspection do not require the level of skill that is espoused then government claims about universal upskilling may indeed appear somewhat hollow, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X12444934">Lloyd and Payne (2009)</xref> suggest. Indeed, government policy may be better directed at working with employers to design better quality, more highly skilled jobs that contain significant worker discretion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143831X12444934">Payne (2004</xref>: 517) does highlight the difficulty of implementing such policies and measuring their outcomes, even in ‘relatively advanced social democratic’ countries such as Finland. It would be expected, therefore, that similar difficulties in policy implementation and evaluation would be even more pronounced in less regulated, more explicitly neoliberal economies such as the UK. This article has nonetheless strengthened the link between employer-facilitated worker discretion and skill and believes that policy designed to improve the former will impact beneficially upon the latter. Third, as noted above, if employers deem those from certain class backgrounds as possessing an inherent advantage in acquiring certain soft skills, questions are raised about social exclusion. Such detailed appraisal of skills demand and the skills content of jobs has implications for assessing the success of supply-side skills formation policies and indeed for future policy directions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this article has strengthened the conceptualization of soft skills by showing how, in certain settings, it is correct to label work reliant on soft skills as skilled. However, for such a label to apply, the work context itself needs to be ‘high skill’; that is, to contain employer-facilitated worker discretion and requirements for extensive contextual knowledge, in order to transform workers’ qualities and abilities into soft skills. In assessing whether work is truly skilled, employer and government rhetoric about soft skills should not be taken at face value as the degree of skill actually required in certain settings may be minimal or even mask more pernicious demands (e.g. for submissiveness). Future research may also be able to elucidate further on the nature of worker discretion and particularly whether brand knowledge and socialization, here described as an element of soft skill, is itself a form of normative control, but this is beyond the scope of this article. What is proposed here is not a monistic solution to the soft skill debate. By not throwing the contextual baby out with the bath water, however, real conceptual weight can be added to the premise that ‘soft skill’ is not simply a ‘humpty dumpty’ term, but can instead have real meaning.</p>
