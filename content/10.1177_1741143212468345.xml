This substantive theory is labelled the ‘theory of selective engagement’. It implies that how principals engage their lowest streamed students is based on the way they perceive streaming as practiced in the Singapore education system, their perception of the Normal Technical students and their personal expectations of these students. The theory proposes that principals can be classified as ‘realists/pragmatists’, ‘innovators/improvisers’ and ‘nurturers’ according to the extent they selectively engage their students in areas such as: (1) Streaming/Lateral Movement; (2) Monitoring; (3) Deployment of Resources; (4) Subject Offerings; (5) Enrichment Programmes; (6) Managing Discipline; (7) Leadership Opportunities; and (8) Treatment of Students.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Engagement</kwd><kwd>grounded theory</kwd><kwd>instructional leadership</kwd><kwd>low ability student</kwd><kwd>management</kwd><kwd>principals</kwd><kwd>Singapore</kwd><kwd>streaming</kwd><kwd>typology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1741143212468345"><title>Introduction</title><p>Singapore schools are known for their students’ achievements in Mathematics and Science as documented by the, Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Since 1995, it has regularly topped these international achievement tests, along with other Asian ‘Tigers’, such as Taiwan and Hong Kong, thereby attracting the attention of policy-makers and educators internationally as they seek an understanding of its educational success. Singapore is also one of the very few countries in the world which practices streaming of all secondary students, a policy long eschewed by most western countries. While Singapore’s most talented students have been the focus of attention and account for its high international profile, what of the academically weaker students who have been placed in the lowest stream, and labelled as the less academically able?</p><p>This article addresses how principals perceive these lowest ability students, especially when alongside them in the same school are more academically able students in two other streams? The central question framing the present study was, ‘How do principals in neighbourhood secondary schools in Singapore manage Normal Technical (NT) students who form the lowest ability stream in their schools?' The question is particularly pertinent in a system whose guiding principle, according to the Singapore government, is meritocracy.</p><p>The article is divided into five sections. The first section gives a brief review of the literature on streaming in Singapore and on principals’ influence on students’ learning outcomes elsewhere. The second section provides the research methodology used in this study and describes how data were collected and analyzed. In the third section, the theory of ‘selective engagement’ is elaborated together with the categories. The fourth section details the three-fold principal typology which emerged, namely: 1) realist/pragmatist, 2) innovator/improviser, and 3) nurturer. Finally, the article highlights a number of implications for policy and practice.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1741143212468345"><title>Background, context and literature</title><p>In the Singapore education system students go through a six-year (from age six to 11) course of compulsory primary level education. At the end of Primary 6, students take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), which assesses their suitability for secondary education. They are ‘placed’ into the appropriate secondary school course, at Secondary 1 (age 12 plus) that will match their learning pace, ability and inclinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143212468345">MOE, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741143212468345">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1-1741143212468345" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Streaming after primary school.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143212468345-fig1.tif"/></fig><p>At the secondary level, students undergo one of three courses based on their PSLE scores: (1) Express Course. This is a four-year course leading to the Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education (GCE) ‘O’ Level Examination; (2) Normal (Academic) Course. This is a four-year course leading to the GCE ‘N’ Level Examination. Students who do well at the ‘N’ levels will qualify for an additional year to prepare for the GCE ‘O’ Level Examination, or progress to the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) on leaving school. Selected students may offer ‘O’ level subjects at Secondary 4, or bypass the ‘N’ levels and progress directly to Secondary 5 to take the ‘O’ levels. In the Normal (Academic) course, students learn a range of subjects similar to those in the Express courses but at a less demanding level in terms of content coverage and depth; and (3) Normal (Technical) Course. The Normal Technical (NT) Course as defined by the Ministry of Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212468345">MOE, 2010a</xref>) is a four-year course leading to the GCE ‘N’ Level Examination that prepares students for a technical-vocational education at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). In this course, students learn English, Mother Tongue, Mathematics and subjects with technical or practical emphases. The Normal Technical students are the slowest academically and their average Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) aggregate score is 159 and below as compared to the Express where the cut-off score is 188. The Normal (Academic) aggregate score ranges between 160 and 188 although there are slight variations among the different schools. These constitute the three distinct streams. Extra-curricular programmes are offered at school level and these are usually available to students in the three streams.</p><p>In 1980 streaming was introduced into the secondary school at Secondary 1 and has since been a Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) mandated policy and practice. However, the Normal (Technical) Course was introduced in 1994, when the Minister of State for Education, Dr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143212468345">Tay (1993</xref>), saw the need to enable students in different streams to progress at their own pace:</p><disp-quote><p>These different courses are designed to meet the needs, abilities and aptitudes of the different PSLE school leavers … Those who have the least aptitude for the academic subjects but are better in practical subjects will go to the Normal (Tech) stream. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143212468345">Tay, 1993</xref>: para. 4)</p></disp-quote><p>Streaming was also partly to address the long-standing problem of student attrition – premature dropouts – in both the primary as well as the secondary schools and ensure that they stayed in school for the required duration of formal schooling, and entered the work force with the necessary qualifications and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143212468345">MOE, 1979</xref>).</p><p>With few exceptions most government neighbourhood secondary schools have all three streams, with one or two classes of NT students given to them each year, each comprising of about 40 students per class. Each year approximately 12 percent of each Primary 1 cohort is streamed into the Normal (Technical) Course, 63 per cent into the Express Course and 22 per cent into the Normal (Academic) Course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143212468345">MOE, n.d</xref>.). Funding for schools is allocated on a per capita student basis and is not linked to streams. Officially, inter-stream movement is possible, but in practice this is relatively rare. Although principals are given autonomy in the management of their schools, this autonomy has to be exercised within the guidelines set by the Singapore MOE. When it concerns lateral movement from one stream to another more demanding stream, not only do the principals have the guidelines to follow, but also the discretionary judgment of whether a student once transferred can make the grade. Most would prefer to err on the safe side and not risk moving students as they would not want them to be unduly stressed by the more demanding curriculum which may cause them to fail should they be unable to cope.</p><p>The academically elite students are mostly taken in by the Independent Schools (IS), the Autonomous Schools (AS), and the Special Assistant Plan Schools (SAP) while the rest – who form the majority – end up in neighbourhood government schools. Some of the more able students who choose to stay in neighbourhood government schools are then posted into the Express stream. Independent schools enjoy greater autonomy in curricular innovations, implementation of school programmes, administration, student admissions and setting of fee structures. Students in the best independent schools have aggregate scores ranging from 262 to 280 and above, with the maximum score varying from year to year depending on the performance of each cohort. Automonous Schools provide a wider range of innovative courses and enrichment programmes that enhance the students’ learning experience and develop their talents. They may charge an additional fee to cover the costs of enhanced educational programmes (as compared to other Government or Government-aided Schools). They also take in students with high PSLE scores. Special Assistant Plan (SAP) schools offer programmes and a learning environment that enable students to be effectively bilingual in English and Chinese. They offer programmes to help students develop stronger understanding of Chinese values and culture. These students have done well in both their English and Mother Tongue examinations and they also have very high PSLE scores. This article is about principals and NT- streamed students in neighbourhood secondary schools; in other words, the lowest ability students in the system.</p><p>Singapore has a population of just five million and a small landmass with no natural resources. Consequently, a highly qualified human resource is a sine qua non for economic survival. For Singapore’s political leaders, streaming is an appropriate tool that has proven effective in selecting the best and most capable, and then training them for future leadership of the nation. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143212468345">Hallam (2002</xref>), policy decisions on pupil grouping have often been based on ideological rather than educational principles. This is especially true in the case of Singapore where an elitist culture has grown and where the smartest and brightest, based on academic test scores, are fast-tracked through specialist curricula and top international universities to return to promising careers in government and the civil service. In recent years the government has officially abolished streaming in primary schools at Primary Four, but not at the secondary school level, despite the numerous pleas from parents and educationists about its deleterious labelling effects. There has been some social disquiet and unhappiness with the perpetuation of the streaming system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741143212468345">Lee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143212468345">Quek, 2006</xref>) although it continues as a key feature of the Singapore school system and there are no immediate plans to abolish it.</p><sec id="section3-1741143212468345"><title>International evidence on streaming/tracking</title><p>A substantial body of research exists on ability grouping of students and its effects especially in the Anglo-American context. Educators have long debated the merits of separating students into different tracks, streams, classes and groups according to their interests, abilities, and prior academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143212468345">Loveless, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143212468345">Oakes, 2005</xref>). Proponents argue that tracking helps schools meet the varying needs of students, provides low achieving students with the attention and slower work pace that they require, allows high-achieving students to be sufficiently challenged by faster-paced, more demanding lessons, and permits teachers to provide different materials for high achievers and more support to low achievers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143212468345">Feldhusen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212468345">Kulik, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143212468345">Loveless, 1999</xref>). Opponents are concerned about the perceived psychological damage to low achievers, the slower pace and lower quality of instruction, the more inexperienced or sometimes less capable teachers assigned to teach lower ability students, the low expectations for student performance held by teachers and the absence of strong behavioural peer role models in classes for low ability students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143212468345">Gamoran, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the weight of research evidence indicates that inequality is exacerbated by tracking with little or no contribution to productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212468345">Carbonaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741143212468345">Watanabe, 2008</xref>) and whatever gains for high achievers are offset by losses for low achievers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143212468345">Gamoran, 2009</xref>). In the USA, the achievement gap between students assigned to high and low tracks have increased over the course of the high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143212468345">Lucas and Gamoran, 2002</xref>) which further supports the finding that tracking not only widens achievement gaps but also reinforces social inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143212468345">Oakes et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143212468345">Lucas and Berends, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212468345">Heck et al., 2004</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212468345">Carbonaro (2005</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143212468345">Tack and Farkas (2006</xref>) have also uncovered inequality among ability groups at high, middle, and low levels. Analyses of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 1999, a study conducted in 28 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, and that of 24 countries that participated in TIMMS 2003 show that tracking tends to reinforce inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143212468345">Huang, in press</xref>). Findings across countries which practice tracking are largely consistent: where tracking systems are present, achievements tend to diverge, and to reinforce initial differences by social class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143212468345">Gamoran, 2009</xref>). Similar association of increasing inequality with grouping between or within schools is also evidenced in studies conducted in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143212468345">Ono, 2001</xref>), Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143212468345">Park, 2009</xref>), South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212468345">Hoadley, 2008</xref>), Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143212468345">Ayalon, 2006</xref>), Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212468345">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>), Belgium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741143212468345">Van Houtte, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143212468345">Van de Gaer et al., 2006</xref>) and the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143212468345">Boaler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143212468345">Ireson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143212468345">Ivinson and Duveen, 2005</xref>).</p><p>After a century of research there is still no definite answer on how best to organize students for learning. Research in the last decade has focused on the instruction provided to students assigned to classes in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143212468345">Gamoran, 2009</xref>). Findings from Belgium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741143212468345">Van Houtte, 2004</xref>) supported the conclusion from US research that tracking effects are largely driven by instructional differences.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1741143212468345"><title>Justification for studying the principal-student relationship in Singapore</title><p>Despite the burgeoning literature on educational leadership and management, the relationship of principals to streaming in schools, and the students who are streamed, is a neglected research area – in Singapore and elsewhere. Few, if any, studies have investigated how principals manage their lower ability students. Indeed there is little previous literature on streaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212468345">Chang, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212468345">Quek, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143212468345">Tan, 1995</xref>) in Singapore schools per se. Rather, existing studies pertaining to streaming in Singapore focus mainly on motivational effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143212468345">Chang et al., 1997</xref>), learning styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212468345">Ng, 1999</xref>) and Mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143212468345">Rahma, 2003</xref>). The void on how principals manage the lowest stream students in their schools is mirrored in the absence of theorizing on the subject – in Singapore and elsewhere. Consequently this study had as its main aim the generation of a theory inductively based on grounded theory methods, of how Singapore principals in a high performing system manage Normal Technical students in their schools.</p><p>Studies on instructional leadership examining the relationship between – principal and student learning outcomes – prove complex, inconclusive and even contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212468345">Hallinger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143212468345">Witziers et al., 2003</xref>). There is a lack of agreement, for example, about the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of principals’ instructional leadership on student outcomes. Some claim that school leadership behaviours have an indirect albeit statistically significant effect on student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143212468345">Barker, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212468345">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212468345">Hallinger and Heck, 1998</xref>), while others agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212468345">Nettles and Herrington’s (2007</xref>: 724) claim that ‘significant relationships have been identified between selected school leadership practices and student learning, indicating that evidence exists for certain principal behaviours to produce a direct relationship with student achievement’. Few, however, dispute the notion that the principal – in diverse ways – can have a profound effect on the quality of teaching and learning going on in a school. Especially in current times of equity and social justice for all learners – irrespective of their ability, gender or ethnicity – the creation of a fair, caring and supportive school culture assumes major importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143212468345">Bush and Middlewood, 2005</xref>). Principals are instrumental in, and the key agents of, building equitable and learning school cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143212468345">Engels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143212468345">Habegger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212468345">MacNeil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212468345">Sergiovanni, 2009</xref>).</p><p>This study, however, is not concerned with measuring the relationship between principals and student learning outcomes, or the direct or indirect effects of the principals’ intervention on student achievement – as important as they may be. Rather, it targets school principals’ actions and practices, focusing specifically on their management of the lowest ability (NT) students in Singapore secondary schools. Consequently, it is primarily concerned with how principals organize and arrange the schooling of the students who have been streamed in the context of the Singaporean school system.</p><p>In the push for constant improvement in student learning performance, research has focused on the more academically inclined students. A compelling case can thus be made for studies that provide new insights and understandings of the academically slower students in less academic educational environments. Given the widespread trend towards more school-based management in many systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212468345">Caldwell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143212468345">Fullan and Watson, 2000</xref>), centralized societal cultures – such as that of Singapore –tend to curtail principals’ powers and influence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212468345">Dimmock (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143212468345">2000</xref>) argues that school-based management can enhance the quality of the curriculum, since the principal can allocate resources to suit local needs in efficient and effective ways to secure the best possible learning outcomes. The achievement of high student learning outcomes is dependent on the school providing a quality curriculum for every student. Evidence also shows that principals’ own values influence their resolution of difficult and problematic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143212468345">Law et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212468345">Ansalone (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212468345">2004</xref>) highlights that the issue in the tracking debate is how to enhance equity and excellence in education and at the same time, educate significant number of students of diverse abilities. He further concludes that de-tracking alone may not be the answer and proposes that a solution might lie in a practical accommodation, which includes mainstreaming whenever possible, frequent track assignments, and deploying teachers with positive attitudes and expectations. Accordingly, whether one is a proponent of tracking or de-tracking, both are found to operate according to the prevailing cultures in schools, thus reflecting the society’s and school’s socio-political agendas and teachers’ philosophy of education and perceptions of who can and cannot learn. This concurs with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143212468345">Biafora and Ansalone’s (2008)</xref> findings that principals’ attitudes and perceptions towards the educational structure of tracking may be somewhat determined by political, socioeconomic, and academic concerns. The present study is thus, justified in exploring Singapore principals’ perceptions of streaming and how this is then translated into the way they perceive and manage the low ability students in their schools.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section5-1741143212468345" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p>A qualitative, inductive grounded theory method of inquiry was considered appropriate for the following reasons: first, perceptions and experiences of principals are both complex and subjective, hence the essence and richness of the concepts they generated would not have been captured if quantitative methods were to have been used. As the present study investigated the phenomenon of managing students according to principals’ perceptions, a qualitative method was most appropriate. Second, a major purpose of the investigation was the building of a theory which was inductively derived, grounded in the data obtained. Consequently, a qualitative approach which facilitated the exploration and formation of theory was justified. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212468345">Lincoln and Guba (1985</xref>) argue that grounded theory researchers prefer that substantive theory emerges from the data because a priori theorizing could not possibly include the multiple realities that are likely to be encountered.</p><p>The study was also underpinned by assumptions in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143212468345">Blumer’s (1969)</xref> account of Symbolic Interactionism, where social interaction is the source from which meanings are derived. It was thus assumed that the practices and the actions of the principals were shaped by their perceptions, and interactions with teachers and others in the school, including the students.</p><sec id="section6-1741143212468345"><title>Sample</title><p>The design of the research was based on 10 secondary school case principals from different types of neighbourhood secondary schools in Singapore. These consisted of seven females and three males whose ages ranged from 45 to 59 years, and with lengths of experience as a school principal from three to 20 years. Initially three schools (and hence principals) were chosen on a convenience sampling basis. This was then followed by snowball sampling in choosing other schools (and principals) with the aim being to achieve maximum variation sampling, that is, principals whose practices and beliefs about NT students exhibited substantial difference. This was necessary to ensure generation of a rich theory encompassing a range of practices.</p><p>Among the 10 schools were two Government Aided Mission schools, one of which was an all girls’ single-sex school. All the other schools were co-educational. All 10 schools had all three streams (Normal Technical, Normal Academic and Express) and five levels of students (Secondary 1 to 5).</p><p>The methods used for data collection comprised one face-to-face interview with principals lasting between an hour and an hour and a half. All the interviews were audio taped in full allowing the researcher opportunity to probe for clarification in follow-up interviews which were done through emails or telephone to follow up on clarification and matters of information. The first round of interviews was structured to gather data about the widest possible range of issues associated with the phenomenon under study. The follow-up interviews were used to: (1) gather new data about known concepts and categories that have been developed about the phenomenon, (2) gather new data about the phenomenon, and (3) involve the principals in a process of testing and verifying data and the emerging theory.</p><p>To add to the credibility of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212468345">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>), member checks were conducted by emailing the transcripts of the interviews to the respondents as soon as they were ready. Document analysis was also used. The documents collected included class subject combinations for the upper secondary classes and records of enrichment programmes planned for the students. The study utilized ‘grounded theory’ methods of data analysis involving three major types of coding – open coding, axial coding, and selective coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143212468345">Glaser, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741143212468345">Strauss and Corbin, 1990</xref>), each of which is fundamental to grounded theory research.</p><p>Sampling and data collection were guided by the process of systematic coding and theoretical saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143212468345">Punch, 1998</xref>: 167). During data analysis, many labels were hypothetically generated during the open coding stage, such as <italic>paradigms, conceptions </italic>and<italic> management</italic>. This led to the formation of concepts and categories at the axial coding stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741143212468345">Strauss and Corbin, 1990</xref>: 61-63). The final theory was labelled ‘Selective Engagement’.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section7-1741143212468345"><title>The theory of selective engagement</title><p>By analysing and understanding how each of the principals manage their students according to the various areas of management identified within their schools, a framework of their engagement with their NT students comprising of the three main typologies was derived. The principals studied selected specific actions based on their conception of streaming, their perception of the NT students and their own beliefs about these students, to engage these students in the various areas of management within their schools. ‘Selective engagement’ refers to the conscious choice and adoption of strategies and various leadership actions that the principals take in meeting the needs of the students, including the provision of opportunities to develop their potential through appropriate learning experiences. The students are thus in effect engaged according to the various management approaches adopted by the principals.</p><p>The main storyline underlying the theory of selective engagement was thus derived as follows:</p><disp-quote><p>How principals in neighbourhood secondary schools, with three streams of students, manage the students in the lowest streams can be understood in terms of how they allocate students to classes, move students across streams, allocate resources, manage students’ behaviour and motivation. They ‘selectively engage’ the NT students within their school. That is, different principals use varying strategies from across a range of leader practices.</p></disp-quote><p>While all principals initially focus on aspects of their school organization and curriculum as instructional leaders, they differentiated the way they managed their lowest ability students. This ‘story’ was used as the basis for developing the fully integrated theory about how principals ‘manage’ their NT students in neighbourhood secondary schools in Singapore.</p><p>By capturing the principals’ perceptions of streaming and of the NT students and their expectations of these students in their own schools, the researcher was able to understand the circumstances that led to the way they manage the students. The principals held different views of streaming, had diverse expectations of the students and adopted different combinations of practices in managing them. The theory of selective engagement captured these diverse practices.</p><p>Part of the theory of selective engagement are the three types of principals, identified by the combinations of their management practices, as follows: (1) ‘Realist/Pragmatist’, (2) ‘Innovator/Improviser’, and (3) ‘Nurturer’.</p><p>The typology derived from the distinctive combinations of management actions adopted by the principals to engage their students. The emergence of the typology and the distinct categories on which it rests in turn led to the theory of selective engagement. All 10 principals manifested some aspects of the three modes or ‘types’ of management.</p><p>Since each of the school cultures from which the principal participants were chosen was unique, it is not surprising that the characteristics of their selective engagement also vary. The word ‘engagement’ was captured as an in-vivo code during the interviews. The grounded theory of Selective Engagement emerged when all participants began to display engagement selectively in each of the categories together with their respective concepts.</p><sec id="section8-1741143212468345"><title>Categories of Selective Engagement: (1) Paradigms; (2) Conceptions; and (3) Management:</title><p>Data were open coded, after which the codes were clustered into categories, of which three emerged – Paradigms, Conceptions and Management Tasks.</p><sec id="section9-1741143212468345"><title>Category: Paradigms</title><p>The category Paradigms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741143212468345">Figure 2</xref>) describes the perceptions of the principals with regard to their mental models of streaming as it is practised in Singapore. This category comprises the concepts of <italic>acceptance</italic>, <italic>rejection</italic> and <italic>modification</italic>. What are the principals’ management actions that lead them to be categorized into each of these models? The principals interviewed hold to three sets of paradigms, but to different degrees: acceptance, rejection and modification. Seven principals accepted streaming and saw its full benefits not only to the students but to society as well. Only one principal rejected streaming totally, seeing it as labelling – leading to lower self-esteem, lower academic challenge and deprivation of opportunities. On the other hand, two principals did not reject streaming outright but advocated some modification because they did not totally agree with how it was being operated currently, although they did agree that there were some benefits to streaming.</p><fig id="fig2-1741143212468345" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Paradigms category.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143212468345-fig2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="section10-1741143212468345"><title>Category: Conceptions</title><p>The category Conceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1741143212468345">Figure 3</xref>) comprises of five different areas relating to the principals’ perceptions and expectations of the NT students. These are – the <italic>academic</italic>, <italic>non-academic</italic>, <italic>motivation</italic>, <italic>behaviour</italic> and <italic>future orientation</italic>. The academic relates to the study and mastery of subject content; the non-academic embraces other areas outside academic content such as co-curricular and extra-curricular domains; motivation relates to the students’ intrinsic impetus and desire; behaviour is linked to the attitudes and external manifestations of these; and finally future orientation is a projection of the anticipated future paths of these students as perceived by the principals.</p><fig id="fig3-1741143212468345" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Conceptions category.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143212468345-fig3.tif"/></fig><p>Both categories – Paradigms and Conceptions – influence the way the principals manage their NT students.

Management is expressed through <italic>innovating</italic>, <italic>adapting</italic>, <italic>abiding</italic> and <italic>equalizing</italic> that emanated from the data coding. Each of these relate to the eight areas of school management identified: (1) streaming/lateral movement, (2) monitoring, (3) deployment of resources, (4) subject offerings, (5) enrichment programmes, (6) managing behaviour, (7) leadership opportunities, and (8) treatment of NT students.</p><fig id="fig4-1741143212468345" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Management category.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143212468345-fig4.tif"/></fig><p>‘Innovating’ refers to the introduction of new strategies and actions taken as well as the making of changes to the existing system to manage the NT students. This sometimes entailed adjusting their strategies within the guidelines as given by the Ministry of Education. ‘Adapting’ refers to the ways principals adjusted their management strategies to suit both the students and the school context. In adapting their way of engagement, principals customize and match their actions to the needs of their students. ‘Abiding’ relates to the way principals engage their NT students by following closely the guidelines and mandates as spelt out by the Ministry. Rules are strictly adhered to. ‘Equalizing’ refers to the ways principals ‘make level the “playing field”’ for the NT students, thereby providing as many equal opportunities to the NT students as to the other, more able students.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741143212468345">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1741143212468345">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1741143212468345">4</xref> above show how each category is supported by its own set of concepts.

The framework in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1741143212468345">Figure 5</xref> summarizes the linkages between the categories conceptions, paradigms, and management and shows how these give rise to the three-fold typology encompassing the different management approaches based on eight areas of management required of a typical neighbourhood secondary school.</p><fig id="fig5-1741143212468345" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Framework of the theory of ‘selective engagement’.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143212468345-fig5.tif"/></fig><p>Different methods of management were practiced by the 10 principals across the eight areas of management. For example, while all three types are concerned with equity and are supportive and protective towards the students, and display adaptability in meeting individual student needs, not all are innovating and abiding with regard to their acceptance of streaming and the environment in which they operate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section12-1741143212468345"><title>Propositions from the theory of selective engagement</title><p>Principals’ ‘selective engagement’ of their students can be expressed in the following propositions generated by the theory.</p><sec id="section13-1741143212468345"><title>Principals selectively vary the way they manage their NT students</title><p>Some of these management approaches are more characteristic of some principals than others; they can be grouped into four main sub-categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1741143212468345">Figure 4</xref>). It can be seen that for each of the eight different management areas – principals vary the way they manage their NT students. When it comes to monitoring, for example, only three principals can be considered as innovating. When it comes to providing leadership opportunities – all 10 principals are ‘equalizing’. In the area of providing subject offerings or choices, only three principals are ‘abiding’ in that they limit their schools to offering only those subjects provided for by the Ministry. Therefore whether a principal is innovating, adapting, abiding or equalizing shapes their management response within the eight different management functions.</p></sec><sec id="section14a-1741143212468345"><title>Principals already have existing paradigms and conceptions regarding streaming and the NT students and these preconceptions influence the way they actually manage their NT students</title><p>The source of the theory of selective engagement therefore can be traced back to the mental models and conceptions of the principals. These influence the principals in the way they selectively manage their NT students within the context of the schools they manage.</p></sec><sec id="section14-1741143212468345"><title>The extent of selective engagement varies among the principals in the different management areas</title><p>The principals did not always share the same paradigms and conceptions with regard to streaming, the students themselves and their expectations of them. Some are realists, when it involves streaming, subject offerings and leadership opportunities, and they abide closely to the Ministry’s guidelines. Yet these same principals may also be innovators/improvisers. For example, a principal may be an innovator in the areas of monitoring, managing discipline, and treatment of students, but (s)he can also be a ‘nurturer’ in the areas of providing enrichment programmes, and leadership opportunities. In other words each of the 10 principals exercises some characteristics of the different typologies – realist/pragmatist, innovator/improviser, and nurturer, with regard to the way they engage the NT students. The combination of practices for each principal across the eight management areas describes the process of ‘selective engagement’.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section15-1741143212468345"><title>A typology of Singapore neighbourhood secondary school principals</title><p>The typology was generated from, and refers to, the categorization of participants based on their individual responses with regard to how they manage students in the less able streams in Singapore neighbourhood secondary schools. In this study, the participants were classified into three types, the notion of type conforming to the sociological ‘ideal type’ as used by Max Weber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143212468345">Aron, 1970</xref>: 201). It is not an ideal type in the sense that it is excellent, nor is it an average; rather, it is a constructed ideal used to approximate reality by selecting and accentuating certain elements – in this case – principals’ selected actions in dealing with the NT students in their schools. In this sense, ‘ideal type’ is applicable to the 10 Singapore government neighbourhood secondary school principals and their settings that form the basis of the study. Hence the concept of ‘ideal type’ is an observable reality as manifested in the three typologies, the Realist/Pragmatist, Innovator/Improviser, and Nurturer and they are ‘ideal’ only in the sense that they are cluster characteristics around which the principals have a proclivity to act in certain ways. Furthermore, the identification, labelling and justification of the three types are based on their emergence inductively from grounded theory methods of analysis. In this sense, the three-fold typology is derivative from the data rather than an application to it.</p></sec><sec id="section16-1741143212468345"><title>Framework of the theory of ‘selective engagement’</title><p>The framework of ‘selective engagement’ shows firstly, each principal’s conceptions, which are their abstract or general ideas inferred or derived from their perceptions and expectations of the NT students in specific instances in the five areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1741143212468345">Figure 3</xref>). Secondly, the framework includes the principals’ paradigms or mental models, which are described as a process of acceptance, rejection and modification of streaming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741143212468345">Figure 2</xref>), all of which affect the way they manage their NT students. For example, when it comes to conception, one principal did not perceive NT students as disruptive and behaving badly. She believes that they could be quite ‘angelic’. She and some of her teachers enjoy working with them. She prefers to take the empathetic view that they are actually, in her words, ‘very loving kids just like kids in any of my other streams. Maybe they needed more help, they may need more support from us because they are so lacking in support from family'. To her, behaviour-wise, NT students are just like any others and they can be very lovable children, very kind, helpful and nice to their teachers and to their classmates. As pointed out by this principal, ‘We cannot equate behaviour with inability to study. The two are totally different issues, altogether.’</p><p>Similarly, with regards to paradigms, one principal who was pro-streaming accepts that not all children are born equally intelligent and with the same ability. For her, streaming with curriculum matching would best meet the needs of the child. Without streaming it would be very difficult for the teacher to manage because ‘for one thing they all would have to take the same core subjects and the depth is expected of all of them because if there were no streaming the expectation is they all sit for the common exams. I would have to level up the group which is already struggling and I think it’s difficult for any teacher to handle.’ Another principal agrees that streaming has negative consequences, but considers this inevitable and that one just has to live with it.</p><p>Conceptions and paradigms, therefore, influence principals’ inclinations to adopt particular management approaches, and from combinations of these, three typologies of principals were derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1741143212468345">Figure 5</xref>).</p><sec id="section17-1741143212468345"><title>Type 1: Realists/Pragmatists</title><p>The label ‘Realist/Pragmatist’ relates to that group of principals who above all else, are practical and down to earth. They are not idealists. Rather they acknowledge what the system can and cannot do. They do not see the relevance of tinkering with the system. Hence, their beliefs about the characteristics of the NT students influence their expectations in a ‘realistic/pragmatic’ way. They do what is within their means and they tend to abide closely to guidelines set by the Ministry of Education. They hold on to a fixed mental model of streaming. The Realist/Pragmatist can be seen not only among principals in the Paradigms category but also in the Conceptions and Management categories. Particularly in the management category, the Realist/Pragmatist element is conspicuous in the areas of student management, for example, in the provision of leadership opportunities in the prefectorial board, one principal places academic ability as one of the prerequisites to holding the top post. As she explained, ‘I think if you really want the Head Prefectship, we must be realistic to recognize that there must be a balance of the academic and non-academic and my child must be able to handle the academic before we put him or her in for the real leadership role as you and I understand.’ The Realists/Pragmatists are practical in their approach. To one particular realist/pragmatist principal, ‘streaming has to stay, given our limited resources, given our urgency to produce workers.’ They know and are governed by the limits and constraints as set by the larger systemic context in which they operate. They are neither inventive nor bold, but by choice abide closely to the guidelines. This can be seen by their ready acceptance and practice in managing the NT students and the programmes within their schools.</p></sec><sec id="section18-1741143212468345"><title>Type 2: Innovators/Improvisers</title><p>The meaning of ‘Innovator/Improviser’ relates to the predominant principal characteristics resembling those of an entrepreneur. Their focus is not fixed on the guidelines, as given by the Ministry, but on creating new opportunities for NT students. They look for new ideas and better ways of doing things while flirting with the boundaries of the guidelines and rules. They are prepared to push the boundaries of the Ministry guidelines so long as they do not get into ‘trouble’ with the Ministry. They are adept at managing the circumstances to selectively engage their students. The Innovator/Improviser can also be pragmatic, believing in inventing new and unique ideas that can be implemented to meet the needs of the students.</p><p>The strong Innovators/Improvisers possess the courage to ‘bend’ the rules to fit the context in which they operate so as to fully benefit the students in their schools. For example, one principal differs from the other principals with regards to lateral movement. To him, if the criteria are followed there will not be much movement. He would like to see ‘in each class two or three students moving from the NT to the Normal Academic (NA) classes every year, for example, this year we have about three students from NT to NA.’ In streaming, this principal’s intention is to integrate the students from the different streams and to prevent the NT students from having a negative self-fulfilling prophecy. He improvises and customizes by combining the NT and NA students for certain subjects and even mandates it for the inter-class games such as soccer. Other less adventurous innovators limit their innovativeness to streaming/lateral movement and subject offering. In terms of opportunities to cross stream, one principal even provides the opportunity to cross in mid-year.</p></sec><sec id="section19-1741143212468345"><title>Type 3: Nurturers</title><p>The meaning of ‘Nurturer’ relates to those principals who above all promote and sustain the growth and development of the individual student. Thus the Nurturer principal is one who creates for the individual student an environment conducive to develop, cultivate, educate and make available as many opportunities as possible for the growth and well-being of their students. While nurturer qualities are found in all the principals studied, two are outstanding and comprehensive in their nurturing across all eight management areas. One of them does not think that NT students are disruptive and behave badly. Her stand is that ‘everyone matters to us so we have to ensure that our students do their best, and we are to expect the best from them. And to expect the best from them we have to stretch them.’ The Nurturer selectively engages their students through adapting, customizing and matching their management approaches to the needs and characteristics of individual students. Moreover, the Nurturer also tries to equalize opportunities for the NT students vis a vis the more academically able students in the other streams.</p></sec><sec id="section20-1741143212468345"><title>Management practices common to all principals</title><p>All 10 principals exhibit some degree of nurturing qualities as they emphasize the pastoral element in their management functions. They have the best interest of their students at heart and they endeavour to ensure that their NT students are not deprived or discriminated against in any way. As nurturers they explore ways to develop the NT students and provide them every learning opportunity.</p><p>The emergence of the typology and the categories generated from the grounded data lead to the theory of Selective Engagement. All three types exhibit to a different degree the characteristics of the different modes of management while at the same time featuring characteristics typical of one dominant type in certain areas. All three types of principals also exhibit common management approaches in their engagement and this is represented in the overlap of the three typologies.</p><p>Principals in the study adhered to different paradigms of streaming – either for or against, or its modification of it. To varying degrees, this affects the way they selectively choose to manage, champion and engage their NT students within the school. The perceptions of these principals of the characteristics and expectations of their NT students also affect the way they selectively engage them. Principals who had lower expectations of the NT students tended to push them less hard, especially in the academic areas. Since they had lower expectations of the students, these principals allowed their own paradigms and conceptions to limit the ways they engage their NT students. Those with less than positive conceptions, for example, provided fewer programmes for the NT students, as their beliefs led them to a restricted provision.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section21-1741143212468345"><title>Implications</title><p>This study contributes to the sparse literature on ability grouping and streaming in Asian contexts. It corroborates the findings in the Anglo-American world of the inequities prevalent in tracked or streamed schools. In terms of Singapore <italic>policy</italic> on streaming, the context of the Theory of Selective Engagement serves to inform policy-makers about how principals manage their NT students in neighbourhood schools. According to this study, principals can be classified into three types according to their management of their NT students. The Singapore MOE’s intention is to set up two new specialized schools for Normal Technical students in the year 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143212468345">MOE, 2010b</xref>); the present study provides some insight into the types of principal the Singapore MOE might appoint.</p><p><italic>In terms of principals’ practice,</italic> the theory has capacity to assist principals in relation to how principals and leaders can and should engage with NT students. In particular, it should provide reassurance to those who might otherwise consider that the successful management of NT students requires the implementation of wholesale changes to their school practices. It is also reassuring to know that principals are mostly nurturing but can become progressively more innovative and improvising in the areas of management when provided with the opportunities and when prepared to take more risks.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212468345">Dimmock and O’Donoghue (1997)</xref> highlight the need to realize that each principal’s leadership is a unique phenomenon. How each principal responds and behaves towards student groups and types in their schools is a symbiosis of policy frameworks and associated expectations, principles and theories underlying best practices, tacit knowledge, individual abilities, and meanings imparted to all of these derived from both current and life history experiences. Through understanding the categories, processes and stages of Selective Engagement and being aware of their predominant ‘type’ (as identified in the present study), principals may better balance the way they engage their students and maximize opportunities for them.</p><p>The theory of selective engagement could also play some role in addressing the leadership training needs of those who might find themselves managing schools with NT students in the future. An emerging trend in Singapore is that those entering teacher training are increasingly those who are academically stronger – students who in their secondary school life were from either the Express stream, the Independent Schools and the Special Assistance Plan Schools. Many of them will not have experienced interaction with the NT students during their schooling. Consequently, they have little idea of what the NT students are capable. The Theory of Selective Engagement reminds them how they can better understand the NT students and be proactive in managing their education.</p></sec><sec id="section22-1741143212468345"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Surprisingly, there is a paucity of research on streaming, especially in Asian settings. This is despite Singapore’s noteworthy reputation as a top-performing school system, and its somewhat exceptional status in maintaining streaming of secondary students. Moreover, although most of the research on streaming emanates from the USA and UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143212468345">Hallam, 2002</xref>), much of it addresses issues other than principals’ interaction with and management of, students in the lower streams. This is an important gap in research knowledge, especially in times of heightened awareness of social justice and equity. Furthermore, there is an equal dearth of research on principals’ leadership influence on student outcomes in Asian contexts generally, and Singapore in particular.</p><p>The grounded theory of Selective Engagement that emerges from this study offers an explanatory insight into how principals in neighbourhood Secondary Schools in Singapore perceive streaming as an organizing principle and practice, how they perceive the academically weakest students, and how their perceptions influence the way they engage with and manage them in different areas. Hopefully this study may be the first of many to address streaming in Asian school contexts and in particular – the influence streaming has on labelling effects on students; the efficacy of principal and leader practices that can help compensate lower streamed students so they can better achieve; and the effects of principals’ values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143212468345">Law et al., 2003</xref>) on their managerial approaches towards equity issues and lower ability students. It is hard to escape the conclusion that attitudes towards streaming and how it is manifested in school organization reflect the broader values of each societal culture. How each principal engages students in the lowest streams, however, also reflects their own individual values and dispositions, and the degree to which they are proactive or conformist in running their schools.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1741143212468345"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
