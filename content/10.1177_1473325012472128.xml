<p>A decade ago Ian Shaw and Roy Ruckdeschel set out to create a space for qualitative social work. They conceded that the phrase itself, <italic>qualitative social work</italic>, might give one pause but proceeded to map out their vision of a landscape of social work practice and social work research that could be qualitatively informed. While they noted that there, ‘has been a tendency to see these as two separate landscapes, we in fact see these as one landscape, if a rather cluttered one’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325012472128">Shaw and Ruckdeschel, 2002</xref>: 5). Their inaugural editorial essay was subtitled, ‘A room with a view’. It was a room, they hoped, with many windows from which to observe the vast, if untidy, environs of qualitative social work.</p>
<p>With this issue of <italic>Qualitative Social Work</italic> (<italic>QSW</italic>) a new editorial board assumes the temporary deed to this property as well as the stewardship of its terrain, however, it is only appropriate to look back at the growth of <italic>QSW</italic> under Ian’s and Roy’s leadership. Perhaps even more importantly, however, we think it is important to pause and recognize the significance of their act in creating the <italic>room</italic> itself. At a time and place which was otherwise relatively inhospitable for social work scholars and practitioners who wished to engage with qualitative forms of inquiry, Ian and Roy introduced <italic>QSW</italic> as an alternative. In doing so, they provided a space, and legitimated a forum, for ideas that might otherwise lack currency in the dominant, mainstream, political landscape of published social work research and practice. They provided a safe haven for those whose ideas might be different or otherwise challenging to the status quo. They offered a serious space for a next generation of young scholars and practitioners to house their work alongside that of pre-eminent scholars in the field, and radical thinkers in the profession. They embraced new ideas and built a space in which creative alternatives could be explored and incubated. At a personal level, they seemed to delight in the ideas of others and to enjoy their roles in conveying them to broader audiences.</p>
<p>Ian and Roy have shepherded this journal through a series of growing pains such as the shift in technology from email to Sage Track electronic submissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325012472128">Editorial 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325012472128">Editorial, 2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325012472128">c</xref>). They have witnessed the advent of Online First. They have grown the journal from four to six issues a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325012472128">Editorial, 2011a</xref>). Of course, they have not done all this without self-reflection. They have been willing to turn a critical and watchful eye to the business of journal editing itself including its politics and practices. They have insisted on a policy that referees from different continents review each submitted manuscript in an attempt to ensure against parochialism. They began sharing reviews with reviewers to foster conversations about rigor and consistency. They have openly admitted to ‘the dreaded split!’, reviewers with diametrically opposed views on the quality of a particular manuscript, while noting their practice was to ‘stray on the side’ of perceived rigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325012472128">Editorial, 2005</xref>: 134). They have reflected on what they believe constitutes, ‘well written manuscripts’ no matter what the methods or methodology and reminded would-be authors that <italic>QSW</italic> regards, ‘the methodology section as a vital component of the process’ and warns authors to ‘allot adequate space to describe their methods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325012472128">Editorial, 2010</xref>: 148).</p>
<p>Ian and Roy have insisted on a democratic and inclusive space. On the journal’s fifth anniversary, they noted that, ‘we do not perceive our roles as that of resolving the debates and are open to articles representing a variety of perspectives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325012472128">Editorial, 2006</xref>: 147). They embraced diversity of views – as long as they were rigorously and intelligently expressed – without moral or political judgment so as not to prematurely foreclose debate. They opened the space to interdisciplinary conversations, to ethnic and culturally marginalized groups, and to international communities. They recognized the significance of the global exchange of ideas (particularly important for a journal birthed in the immediate aftermath of 9/11). Thus they actively resisted regression to insularity that is the enemy of academic freedom. They have served as champions for qualitative approaches to practice and to research but understood the complicated and even combustible nature of the clashing and blurring boundaries.</p>
<p>What have they offered us as readers of <italic>QSW</italic>? We have been stimulated by conversations from around the globe. We have learned lessons from Bahrain, New Zealand, Jordan, China, Finland and Cameroon as well as Barcelona, London, Tel Aviv, New York, Toronto, and Hong Kong. We have read conceptual, philosophical, theoretical and methodological works. But we have also been instructed in practical applications. We have been exposed to action research, autoethnography, ethnomethodology, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, appreciative inquiry, participant observation, oral histories, narratives, focus groups, document analysis, case studies and visual methods. We have been treated to a number of special issues on topics including research ethics, critical social work, new voices in social work research, narrative and ethnography, practice and writing, qualitative approaches to intervention research, constructing identities in social work settings and qualitative social work research in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>The articles contained in this issue, of course, still bear the imprint of Ian’s and Roy’s tenure as editors. However, we could not be more excited about the fascinating works that appear on the subsequent pages including five articles and a book review section containing an editorial and two essays. The five principal articles seem to fall into two thematic categories. The first three engage with variations on the project of identity construction and the second two take up innovative methodological strategies and provide guidance for the approaches to inquiry that their authors’ are championing. This issue closes with a set of provocative book review essays on the legacy of racism in the United States.</p>
<p>In our lead article, Dorte Caswell, Leena Eskelinen and Søren Peter Olesen offer a fascinating look at the Danish welfare system and how clients resist the identity being imposed upon them by the state while negotiating alternative identities with their social workers. As in other areas of the world – such as the United States which is now relying heavily on a welfare-to-work model and the assertion of personal responsibility – the Danish welfare state ‘encourages clients to construct identities that in one way or another relate to the labour market’. Yet clients, particularly those who face additional hurdles on the road to employability often resist this state-imposed identity either through ‘voice’ or ‘exit’ because it conflicts with their own narratives of self. The net result is that this, ‘lack of latitude within the institutional framework of the job centre for conveying a personal story of problems and being unwell can promote the clients to use voice and exit strategies in their interaction with the social workers.’</p>
<p>Perhaps equally fascinating in this article is the creative use of empirical evidence from two different qualitative studies and the recognition that interactions (in addition to interviews) can be ‘seen as naturally occurring data’. The research team capitalized on this rich source of information. We are particularly appreciative that these authors took the time to wrestle with translating empirical evidence from oral Danish to written Danish to written English. It is not only an extra burden but creates an additional layer of complexity to the entire research endeavor.</p>
<p>The second article in this set is by Liz Beddoe and it also focuses attention on identity, but this time with the lens pointed toward the professional social worker employed in health settings. Introducing an historical theoretical lens, Beddoe writes that, ‘the history of health social work… is a complex struggle to define itself within the context of a health system with many powerful players.’ Sadly, Beddoe finds that social workers often feel they do not measure up when faced with continual comparisons with other professionals in the health system environment. In part, she concludes, ‘This study suggests marginalization is still a feature of social work in institutional health settings.’</p>
<p>In the third article in this issue, questions of identity are also in play but this time for mothers of children with Asperger’s Syndrome. Jessica Gill and Pranee Liamputtong used both in-depth individual interviews and diaries to explore the views of these women. The pair examine the moral career of motherhood and link ‘internal matters such as image of self and self-identity with broader structures’ noting the tensions created if mothers feel unable to live up to the society’s expectations of motherhood. This is particularly difficult when dealing with children whose actions and behaviors may be at odds with social norms. This tension can take its toll on the mother’s physical and emotional health.</p>
<p>The final two articles deal with our second overarching theme, that of innovative methodological approaches and thus offer us food for thought about ways of approaching qualitative inquiry. The first of the two, by Donna Baines and Ian Cunningham, explores the benefits of ‘rapid ethnography’ (RE), comparative case study, and insider/outsider comparative perspectives. RE – which might sound like an oxymoron to some – relies on shorter immersion periods, (although considerable pre-field preparation time) and rapid turnaround but also requires at least two researchers to be involved in ‘all aspects of data collection.’ In particular, the researchers capitalized on the international comparative nature of their overall project by pairing off researchers from two different countries to ‘provide a local, grounded perspective as well as an unacclimatized, outside perspective’ with the insider-outsider matching offering an ‘additional level of comparative perspective.’ They tout this methodology as a good way to continue international, collaborative research during a time of diminishing resources but also address challenges and limitations of this methodology.</p>
<p>The second of the methodological articles is written by Caroline Skehill, Mirja Satka and Susanna Hoikkala. These researchers attempt to integrate two distinct approaches to case file analysis – specifically in the area of child protection cases – in Northern Ireland and Finland. Their hope is that a hybrid (or what they call a ‘derived approach’) will permit ‘researchers to dig deep into child welfare archives such as case files, to seek to understand and illuminate the relations between different levels of discourse and practice at different times and in particular spaces and places.’ The authors offer readers a four-step process by which to accomplish this integrated methodological plan.</p>
<p>With this issue of <italic>QSW</italic> we also welcome the new US Book Reviews Editor, Deborah Gioia. She delivers perhaps one of the most powerful sets of essays ever published in this section of <italic>QSW</italic>. In her essay she tackles the onerous, maybe impossible, task of ‘getting the story right’ while talking about a subject that has been largely taboo. Gioia writes that her home city of Baltimore has, ‘stepped lightly around conversations of (racial) segregation and integration for decades’. Nonetheless, Gioia now considers the, ‘legacy of race, science, historical practices of institutions, and complicated notions of social justice’ in all her work. Two very talented young African American scholars review two books dealing with complicated stories about race and the legacy of racism. Tanya Sharpe’s essay brought tears to my eyes as she situates the book in the context of her own family life and Desmond Upton Patton’s review reminds us that choice is important but so too is fully understanding ‘how choices are constrained by environmental conditions.’</p>
<sec id="sec1-1473325012472128"><title>Coda</title>
<p>While <italic>QSW</italic> co-editor Michal Krumer-Nevo will take up the task of introducing the new editorial team in greater detail in our second issue, I know that the entire new and continuing crew at <italic>QSW</italic>, want to thank founding, outgoing editors, Ian Shaw and Roy Ruckdeschel, for their work and dedication over the past decade. They have been cheerleaders, champions, advocates and pioneers. In our view, not only did they build the room from which to witness the panoramic views of qualitative social work, they hosted the party housed there with warmth, wisdom, and diplomacy.</p>
