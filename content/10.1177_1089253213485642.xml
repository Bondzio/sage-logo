<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The anesthetic approach to the patient with a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) presents many challenges and requires a team approach. Close communication with the surgeon regarding the operative procedure, position of the patient, need for one-lung ventilation (OLV), bypass cannulation strategy (when applicable), degree of heparinization, and additional monitoring techniques (ie, motor-evoked potentials, cerebral oxygen saturation, cerebrospinal fluid, and spinal artery pressures) is necessary to ensure optimal perioperative management. Preoperative assessment must include the location, extent, and size of the aneurysm, and evaluation of every organ system. Attention must be given to possible deformation of the airway, such as when there is an intimate relationship of the left main bronchus to the body of the aneurysm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253213485642">Figure 1</xref>). Advances in the surgical approach to repairing a TAA has led to increasing use of OLV, which provides better surgical exposure and protects the nondependent lung from mechanical trauma caused by retraction or surgical manipulation. However, the use of OLV to improve surgical exposure is a relative indication, and the operative plan for airway management in TAA repair is still somewhat dependent on the preferences and experience of the surgeon and anesthesiologist. We will discuss and evaluate the options for OLV in TAA repair as they apply to preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management with regard to a clinical case scenario.</p>

<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>A 59-year-old man presented to his primary care doctor with a 4-month history of paroxysmal dyspnea and wheezing. He had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and was a current smoker with a 40 pack-year history. Chest X-ray revealed hyperinflated lungs and a widened mediastinum. Computed tomography of the chest subsequently showed a 6-cm descending TAA with mural thrombus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253213485642">Figure 1</xref>) and the aneurysm was compressing the left mainstem bronchus. He was referred for possible surgery. On workup, he was found to have a positive stress test; cardiac catheterization reveals a 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1089253213485642">
<title>Preoperative Management</title>
<p>Preoperatively, the anesthesia and surgical teams need to discuss the surgical approach, the location, and the size of the aneurysm. With aneurysmal compression of the tracheobronchial tree, as in our case, the airway walls may be thin and friable, and the cartilage may even be destroyed. Manipulation of these airways during OLV may be difficult or impossible and comes with the risk of aneurysm rupture. Development of adhesions between the aneurysm and airway not only make the anesthetic management more challenging but it can also make the surgical repair more difficult, and stenting of stenotic airway lesions may be necessary in addition to aneurysm repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253213485642">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The preoperative history and physical exam provide insight into the aneurysm location, with compression of the tracheobronchial tree causing dyspnea, wheezing, or stridor on examination.In addition, hoarseness can result from compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and diaphragmatic paralysis can occur from impingement on the phrenic nerve due to aneurysmal expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253213485642">1</xref></sup> When hemoptysis is present there is concern for aneurysmal leakage into the airway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253213485642">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253213485642">3</xref></sup> Preoperative imaging studies should be reviewed. The chest X-ray and/or computed tomography scan can assist in determining the aneurysm size and its location, specifically in relation to the left mainstem bronchus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253213485642">Figure 2</xref>). Additionally, imaging can give insight into preexisting lung disease. The chest X-ray or computed tomography scan may also be used to assess the length of the right mainstem bronchus to determine if it is of adequate size for the bronchial cuff of a double-lumen tube (DLT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253213485642">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253213485642">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Intraoperative Management</title>
<p>After induction of anesthesia, the patient was intubated with a 39 French left-sided DLT. Prior to positioning of the tube, a fiber-optic bronchoscope was passed via the bronchial lumen and the airway inspected. The left mainstem bronchus was observed to be severely narrowed from aneurysmal compression. The endotracheal tube was withdrawn and a right-sided DLT was inserted. Under fiber-optic visualization, the tube was positioned in the right mainstem bronchus.</p>
<p>The case proceeded via left lateral thoracoabdominal incision. During dissection and manipulation of the airway, the patient’s SpO<sub>2</sub> decreased to 82%. Bronchoscopy revealed that the DLT had moved distally and was obstructing the right upper lobe bronchus. The tube was repositioned and SpO<sub>2</sub> returned to the &gt;90%. Partial cardiopulmonary bypass was implemented during the case and fluid management was dictated by consideration of pressures (arterial + central venous pressure), urine output, hematocrit/hemoglobin, and blood loss.</p>
<p>In TAA repair, OLV is commonly achieved via a DLT, usually with the placement of a left-sided DLT, but in some circumstances by right-sided DLT, or by bronchial blockage. OLV provides surgical exposure and protects the nondependent lung from contusion by reducing the need for lung retraction. This is of particular importance in patients who are heparinized as they are at risk for pulmonary hemorrhage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253213485642">6</xref></sup> Lung isolation is also beneficial as it reduces contamination of the dependent lung from blood and/or secretions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253213485642">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A DLT presents several advantages for achieving OLV in TAA repair. It is relatively reliable to place, allows easy suctioning of both lungs, is unlikely to migrate during surgery, and in the case of migration can be repositioned with the use of a fiber-optic bronchoscope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253213485642">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253213485642">8</xref></sup> A left-sided DLT is used preferentially for OLV because of its increased reliability and margin of safety when compared with a right-sided DLT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253213485642">9</xref></sup> However, when the aneurysm compresses or invades the left mainstem bronchus, a left-sided DLT may be difficult or even impossible to place, as in our case example. Hemorrhage has been reported after placement of a left-sided DLT in a patient with a contained rupture of a TAA in the descending aorta, but the actual incidence of rupture from manipulation of the left mainstem bronchus in patients with unruptured TAAs cannot be easily defined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253213485642">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253213485642">10</xref></sup> Despite more challenging placement, a right-sided DLT has the advantage of avoiding the left mainstem bronchus, but many feel that there is a lower margin of safety with positioning of an right-sided DLT than an left-sided DLT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253213485642">11</xref></sup> This is because of the theoretical risk of right upper lobe collapse and consequent V/Q mismatch and desaturation, particularly when fiber-optic bronchoscopy is not used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253213485642">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite this, certain techniques can ensure a higher margin of safety when using a right-sided DLT. A recent study by Campos et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253213485642">12</xref></sup> compared the use of right-sided DLTs versus left-sided DLTs. The DLTs were placed by direct laryngoscopy, and placement was confirmed by flexible fiber-optic bronchoscopy. While the time for initial placement was slightly longer for right-sided DLTs, the study demonstrated that right-sided DLTs can be used without increased risk of right upper lobe collapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253213485642">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253213485642">13</xref></sup> In most cases, a left-sided DLT will be the appropriate choice but there may be situations, such as our case, that warrant the use of a right-sided DLT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1089253213485642">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1089253213485642">4</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Advances in surgical technique have led to interventions for patients with challenging airways and the placement of a bronchial blocker provides another option for lung isolation in clinical situations where a DLT is not ideal. In patients with abnormal airway anatomy, DLTs are limited by standardized lengths that may be too long or too short, their larger diameter can damage the arytenoid cartilage or cause bronchial rupture, and the fixed distance between tracheal and bronchial openings may lead to inadequate ventilation and oxygenation. A bronchial blocker also offers advantages over a DLT in patients with difficult airways or tracheostomies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253213485642">14</xref></sup> In these patients, placement of a single-lumen tube with a bronchial blocker may be more feasible and safer than DLT placement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253213485642">8</xref></sup> Additionally, bronchial blockade is simpler in the preoperatively intubated patient as potential issues with tube exchange can be avoided. As with a DLT, the safety and efficacy of bronchial blockade is increased with the use of fiber-optic bronchoscopy for assessment of proper placement, particularly when position changes are necessary because of the risk of bronchial blocker movement and dislodgement during positioning and surgical manipulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253213485642">14</xref></sup> A bronchial blocker was an option for OLV in our case, but we chose not to use one in order to minimize compression and possible rupture of the TAA.</p>
<p>During the repair of extensive TAAs the maintenance of distal aortic perfusion is often necessary to minimize spinal cord ischemia, preserve vital organ function, and reduce cardiac afterload, especially in patients with underlying coronary artery disease, aortic valve dysfunction, decreased pulmonary function and/or renal insufficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253213485642">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253213485642">16</xref></sup> Methods for distal perfusion include passive aortic shunts, partial femoral–femoral cardiopulmonary bypass with or without hypothermia, complete cardiopulmonary bypass with profound hypothermic circulatory arrest, and left heart bypass with centrifugal pump.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253213485642">17</xref></sup> Left heart bypass has been recognized as a simple technique that uses minimal anticoagulation and can provide oxygenation, if necessary, when an oxygenator is added to the bypass system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253213485642">18</xref></sup> The technique has been described by others, and in brief overview, it depends on the patient’s right heart to pump blood through the lungs to the left heart where a large venous cannula is placed to direct blood from the left atrium to the distal aorta or femoral artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253213485642">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1089253213485642">19</xref></sup> Not every patient undergoing TAA repair will require distal perfusion, but identifying patients who will benefit is paramount to successful intraoperative management and postoperative course.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1089253213485642">
<title>Postoperative Considerations</title>
<p>After the completion of the surgery, the DLT was left in place and the patient was transported to the intensive care unit (ICU). By postoperative day 2, he had an increasing oxygen requirement and could not be extubated. Out of concern for airway trauma, the decision was made to exchange his DLT for a single-lumen endotracheal tube. The exchange was accomplished with use of direct laryngoscopy and an airway exchange catheter.</p>
<p>Despite the advantages of using a DLT for intraoperative management, it may present obstacles for postoperative care. Chief among these is whether to keep the DLT in place postoperatively or exchange it for a single-lumen tube. Almost every patient undergoing a TAA repair will require postoperative mechanical ventilation. There are 2 primary concerns when determining the appropriate postoperative endotracheal tube: (<italic>a</italic>) airway resistance and secretion clearance and (<italic>b</italic>) airway trauma and irritation.</p>
<p>Airway resistance, according to the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, is proportional to the radius of a tube to the fourth power, and directly proportional to the tube’s length. Because a DLT is split into 2 lumens and is longer than a single-lumen tube many physicians believe that it presents substantially greater resistance to ventilation and will impede weaning from mechanical ventilation. However, resistance varies from one type of DLT to another. Slinger and Lesiuk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1089253213485642">20</xref></sup> have shown that a 37F Rusch or Sheridan DLT actually has <italic>lower</italic> airway resistance than a 7.5-mm single-lumen tube. Therefore, use of a DLT postoperatively should not be expected to increase work of breathing or impede weaning from mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>A DLT has a larger outer diameter than a single-lumen tube and is therefore more likely to cause hoarseness and sore throat postoperatively, although rates of severe tracheobronchial injuries are low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253213485642">21</xref></sup> Although this should be a consideration, there is no evidence that leaving the DLT in place postoperatively leads to worse airway edema or inflammation. Placing the patient in head-up position postoperatively can reduce pharyngeal edema, and perioperative administration of steroids (a routine practice at some institutions) can also decrease postextubation stridor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1089253213485642">22</xref></sup> Although a DLT traverses the carina and may cause more cough than a single-lumen tube or pharyngeal airway,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1089253213485642">23</xref></sup> this has not been well evaluated in the postoperative setting.</p>
<p>As stated above, a DLT should not affect weaning from mechanical ventilation but most institutions routinely exchange the DLT to a single-lumen tube. Presence of a single-lumen tube in the ICU setting, particularly when a patient is expected to need prolonged postoperative ventilation (ie, &gt;48 hours), is helpful for the ICU physicians, nursing staff, and respiratory therapists. ICU staff are generally accustomed to single-lumen tubes and with one in place bronchoscopy can easily be performed to sample secretions and remove mucus plugs.</p>
<p>Exchanging a DLT for a single-lumen tube can usually be performed postoperatively with simple direct laryngoscopy or video laryngoscopy. However, this may be risky in a patient who suffers from airway edema and coagulopathy, and has limited pulmonary reserve. An airway exchange catheter can prove useful in such situations. An airway exchange catheter (ie, Aintree catheter) can be inserted into the bronchial or tracheal lumen of the DLT and act as a guide for removal and subsequent replacement with a single-lumen tube. Additionally, many airway exchange catheters can be converted, via an included connector, to a conduit for jet ventilation or insufflation of oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1089253213485642">Figure 5</xref>). This is valuable as a temporizing measure in cases of airway loss during tube exchange.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1089253213485642-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Several guidelines have been proposed for use of an airway exchange catheter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253213485642">14</xref></sup> The airway exchange catheter should be longer than 70 cm, although it should not be inserted more than 24 cm from the lips to avoid tracheobronchial injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253213485642">24</xref></sup> The airway exchange catheter with the largest diameter allowable by the DLT should be used. If it is difficult to advance the single-lumen tube over the airway exchange catheter use of a laryngoscope to lift the supraglottic tissue may be helpful. Use of 2 airway exchange catheters, one placed in the tracheal lumen and one placed in bronchial lumen of the DLT, allow less glottis impingement and easier advancement of a single-lumen tube as it is slides over one of the airway exchange catheters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253213485642">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>In some circumstances, it may be undesirable to attempt tube exchange at the end of a case. This is particularly true when the airway is severely edematous, making the risk of airway loss after removal of the DLT prohibitively high. Additionally, secretions or blood in the pharynx, as may result with heparinization and transesophageal echo probe insertion make it undesirable to change the endotracheal tube and risk lung contamination. In these cases, as indicated above, postoperative use of the DLT for ventilation is an acceptable option.</p>
<p>Good pain control is essential to postoperative management and can facilitate early extubation. Parenteral opioids have been the mainstay of therapy and provide flexibility and reliability. However, epidural analgesia has been shown to decrease postoperative pulmonary complications and improve lung function when compared to intravenous opioids after thoracotomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1089253213485642">26</xref></sup> and can also provide improved pain control after abdominal aortic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253213485642">27</xref></sup> However, the usefulness of epidural analgesia is limited in thoracic aortic surgery by several factors. The risk of epidural hematoma, although rare, is a potentially devastating complication and may be too great in the presence of anticoagulation, especially if cardiopulmonary bypass with full heparinization is required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1089253213485642">28</xref></sup> Also, epidural infusions of local anesthetics can induce sympathectomy resulting in hypotension and interfering with the achievement of blood pressure goals after TAA repair, but patients without coagulation concerns may benefit from epidural infusions containing a low concentration of local anesthetic or opioid-only infusions thus mitigating hypotension issues.</p>
<p>Paravertebral catheters induce less hypotension than epidural blockade, but come with the same contraindications regarding coagulopathy. Single shot intercostal nerve blocks are a reasonable option to provide pain relief in patients whose coagulation status do not allow for neuraxial techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1089253213485642">29</xref></sup> Although adjuvants such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can provide excellent pain relief, their use is often limited by end-organ (ie, renal) toxicity in patients already at risk, so they should be used cautiously. An optimal pain regimen for patients undergoing TAA repair will need to be individualized and depend highly on surgical technique, coagulation status, and hemodynamic stability, and may include only parental opioids or could allow for a preoperatively placed epidural with an infusion of local anesthetic and opioid to be continued several days postoperatively.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The evaluation and care of patients undergoing TAA repairs provides many challenges, and the perioperative management decisions must include a multidisciplinary approach that is tailored to each patient. This approach addresses the different modalities available for lung separation, bypass cannulation, and postoperative pain control. The implementation of a modern anesthesia practice will improve safety and efficacy throughout the perioperative period leading to favorable outcomes.</p>
