<abstract>
<p>Three studies examined the effect of nouns and adjectives for designations of nationality on intergroup bias. In Study 1, participants (<italic>N</italic> = 237) evaluated group artifacts whose authors’ nationality was labeled with nouns or adjectives. Use of nouns enhanced in-group favoritism, manifested as a preference of the in-group artifact. Study 2 (<italic>N</italic> = 431) tested the effect of nouns and adjectives on attitudes toward the in-group and out-group focusing on the moderating role of in-group identification. Use of nouns led to a stronger relative preference of the in-group, pronounced especially in low identified group members. Study 3 (<italic>N</italic> = 979) examined the effect of nouns and adjectives in a more applied survey setting. Intergroup bias concerning material restitution for confiscated property was stronger when the ethnicity of the former owners was labeled with nouns. The article emphasizes that subtle variation in language use has a consistent impact on intergroup evaluation.</p>

<p>On July 22, 2011, media around the world brought news about a bomb blasted in the Government quarter of the capital of Norway, Oslo, and subsequent shooting rampage on Utoya Island. The press informed that the perpetrator was a Norwegian citizen. However, the way of denoting the perpetrator’s nationality differed in various sources. Some stuck to “a Norwegian citizen” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X12463209">Mala &amp; Goodman, 2011</xref>), whereas others called him “a Norwegian” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261927X12463209">Winter, 2011</xref>). Although the meaning of both labels refers to the same fact, in this article, we will show that different linguistic forms vary in their effect on receivers’ understanding and consequent evaluation of issues from intergroup domain.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that linguistic forms used for descriptions of people’s characteristics influence subsequent judgments on the depicted persons and their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12463209">Carnaghi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12463209">Gelman &amp; Heyman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261927X12463209">Semin &amp; Fiedler, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X12463209">Walton &amp; Banaji, 2004</xref>). People tailor the linguistic features of their utterances according to goals they want to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X12463209">Douglas &amp; Sutton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261927X12463209">Wenneker, Wigboldus, &amp; Spears, 2005</xref>). This effect is not restricted to interpersonal communication but occurs also on a more general level, for example in mass media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12463209">Maass, Corvino, &amp; Arcuri, 1994</xref>). As such, the psychological consequences of linguistic forms deserve thorough investigation.</p>
<p>The presented studies focus on the effect of two linguistic forms, namely nouns and adjectives, used for nationality labels on intergroup bias. Much of the information we receive about members of social groups (i.e., nations) is labeled with either nouns or adjectives. If there are indeed, as we assume, systematic differences in the effects of these two linguistic forms on the attitudes toward the group members, this would indicate the relevance of our research for the quality of intergroup relations. Our research makes a step forward in understanding of different cognitive and social implications of the use of nouns and adjectives for description of a group membership.</p>

<title>Inductive Potential of Nouns</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12463209">Allport (1954)</xref> noted a prominent role of nouns in interpersonal as well as intergroup perception. His quote that “nouns cut slices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12463209">1954</xref>, p. 178) emphasized the impact of nouns on social categorization. An important feature of nouns is that they elicit a more essentialist perception as compared with other linguistic forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261927X12463209">Rothbart &amp; Taylor, 1992</xref>). Essentialism refers to a belief that a certain social category has an underlying, identity-determining essence (e.g., preference, trait, or attitude) that is permanent and common to all members of that category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X12463209">Haslam, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261927X12463209">Yzerbyt, Estrada, Corneille, Seron, &amp; Demoulin, 2004</xref>). Essentialism can be operationalized in terms of strength, stability, and resilience of the evaluated category characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12463209">Gelman &amp; Heyman, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Empirical evidence on the high inductive potential of nouns was offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12463209">Gelman and Heyman (1999)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X12463209">Walton and Banaji (2004)</xref>. The authors showed that nouns (e.g., “a Shakespeare reader”) elicited more essentialist perceptions of the described behavior as compared with the same behavior described by verbs (e.g., “reads Shakespeare a lot”). In both lines of research, artificially created new categories (e.g., “a creature-believer”) as well as established labels (e.g., “a carrot-eater”) lead to perceptions of higher strength, stability, and resilience of the described preference in comparison with their verb counterparts (e.g., “she eats carrots whenever she can”). These findings confirmed that the linguistic form per se and not the content of established labels influences the perceived essentialism of the described characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12463209">Gelman &amp; Heyman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X12463209">Walton &amp; Banaji, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>However, nouns do not resemble verbs either functionally or phonetically. It is then of no surprise that they lead to different perceptions of described behaviors. An interesting research question pertains to a variation in inferences elicited by more similar grammatical forms, namely nouns and adjectives. Nouns and corresponding adjectives resemble on the surface (e.g., German vs. a German) as well as in their function (e.g., ascribing particular characteristics, such as nationality). However, there are also profound differences between them. Whereas adjectives assign people particular qualities, nouns state their category membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X12463209">Hall &amp; Moore, 1997</xref>). Additionally, nouns imply a set of characteristics whereas adjectives are limited only to the one stated (e.g., a blonde vs. blonde). Nouns are also semantically superordinate to adjectives. That is, nouns contain the information that is processed primarily whereas adjectives are always secondary in information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261927X12463209">Wierzbicka, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the research reviewed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12463209">Gelman &amp; Heyman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X12463209">Walton &amp; Banaji, 2004</xref>), we can assume that nouns differ from adjectives in a similar manner as they differ from verbs—with respect to perceived essentialism and category salience. Nouns make category membership more salient and elicit a more essentialist perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12463209">Allport, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261927X12463209">Rothbart &amp; Taylor, 1992</xref>). In line with this assumption, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12463209">Carnaghi et al. (2008)</xref> showed that nouns used for category labels, in comparison with adjectives, inhibited alternative categorization, facilitated stereotypically congruent inferences, and implied higher level of essentialism. However, their research focused on the consequences of nouns and adjectives in interpersonal perception and evaluation of described persons on an individual level. Our studies, in contrast, examine the effect of nouns and adjectives on the perception and evaluation on the group level, specifically, on various manifestations of intergroup bias.</p>

<title>Language and Intergroup Bias</title>
<p>Intergroup bias refers to the tendency to evaluate in-group members more favorably than out-group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X12463209">Hewstone, Rubin, &amp; Willis, 2002</xref>), which serves as a basis for prejudice. Intergroup bias is influenced by category salience (for meta-analysis see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261927X12463209">Mullen, Brown, &amp; Smith, 1992</xref>) and essentialist group perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261927X12463209">Keller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261927X12463209">Leyens et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, if nouns elicit perceptions of essentialism and high category salience, we predict that they also enhance intergroup bias.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present research is to examine the link between linguistic forms used for nationality labels and resulting intergroup bias displayed by recipients of the messages. Based on the previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12463209">Allport, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12463209">Carnaghi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261927X12463209">Rothbart &amp; Taylor, 1992</xref>), we expect nationality labels denoted by nouns to have higher impact on intergroup bias as compared with adjectives. To our knowledge, our research is the first attempt to examine how different linguistic forms influence intergroup bias across different languages. We tested our predictions in three experimental studies. In Study 1, we focused on the effect of nouns and adjectives on intergroup bias in evaluation of in-group and out-group artifacts. Study 2 used a more real-life context to determine how the use of nouns and adjectives influenced evaluation of the in-group and out-group after learning about an intergroup conflict. Finally, Study 3 analysed the effect of the two linguistic forms on intergroup bias in an opinion poll concerning issues of high social and political relevance.</p>

<title>Study 1</title>
<p>Study 1 examined the effect of nouns and adjectives on intergroup bias in three different language groups (Finno-Ugrian, Germanic, and Slavic). Participants from various European countries were presented with two abstract paintings. One painting was supposedly created by an in-group artist, the other by an out-group artist. To measure intergroup bias, participants were asked to evaluate the two pieces of art in terms of their aesthetic quality. We manipulated the way of denoting the artists’ nationalities using either nouns or adjectives. We expected that nouns in comparison with adjectives would lead to a more pronounced intergroup bias, that is, a stronger preference for the painting supposedly created by an in-group artist, in all countries under study.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0261927X12463209">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Overall, 324 university students were recruited for a study allegedly dealing with how lay people view abstract paintings. Exclusion of those who were unwilling to provide answers to all questions (<italic>N</italic> = 75) and those who were suspicious about the goals or skeptical about the method of the study<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0261927X12463209">1</xref></sup> (<italic>N</italic> = 22), led to a final sample of 237 participants (<italic>M</italic> = 21.2 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.09; ranging from 16 to 65 years; 32% male). The participants came from four European countries: the Czech Republic (<italic>n</italic> = 80), Finland (<italic>n</italic> = 45), Germany (<italic>n</italic> = 42), and Poland (<italic>n</italic> = 70).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0261927X12463209">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>At the beginning of the questionnaire, participants were instructed as follows: “Below you will find two paintings by two different artists. Please, look carefully at the two paintings and their labels and form your personal opinion about them.” Then, participants evaluated the paintings and provided basic demographic data. Finally, participants were rewarded and debriefed.</p>
<p>To manipulate linguistic abstractness between participants, the nationalities of the supposed artists in captions below the paintings were described either by nouns or adjectives. The nationality of the supposedly in-group painter corresponded to the participants’ own nationality (Czech, Finnish, German, or Polish). The nationality of the out-group painter was Danish, as citizens of Denmark represent a neutral out-group to all participating countries. The neutrality was defined as an absence of any conflict between two countries in the past and at present.</p>
<p>To make the captions below the presented paintings seem more realistic, we included a monogram of the supposed author and the word “painter” (e.g., “S.G., a German, a painter” vs. “S.G., a German painter”; see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261927X12463209">appendix</xref> for the stimulus material). It was necessary to include the word “painter” because it would have been impossible to create grammatically meaningful captions with bare adjectives describing the nationality in all four languages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0261927X12463209">2</xref></sup> All combinations of the artists’ group membership with the two paintings were counterbalanced. The paintings used as an experimental material were chosen on their similarity that was pretested in a pilot study. In the pilot study, we presented university students (<italic>N</italic> = 80) with six black-and-white abstract paintings that resembled in their outline and level of abstraction. We asked participants to evaluate the paintings in terms of layout, originality, and their personal preference. Subsequently, we chose two paintings most similar with respect to the evaluated dimensions.</p>
<p>Participants were to assess the relative aesthetic quality of the two abstract paintings (Painting A and Painting B) using four items: “In your view, which painting has a better composition?”, “. . . is more meaningful?”, “. . . is more beautiful?” and “. . . would you prefer to hang on a wall in your room?.” The answering format was a bipolar 5-point Likert-type scale, with the options <italic>Painting A much better</italic> (assigned −2), <italic>Painting A a little better</italic> (−1), <italic>Both the same</italic> (0), <italic>Painting B a little better</italic> (+1), and <italic>Painting B much better</italic> (+2) for the first item, for the subsequent items, “better” was replaced with “more.” Subsequently, a reliable bias scale (α = .75) was computed as a mean of the four items. Scores higher than zero indicate more bias in terms of a preference of the in-group artist’s painting over the out-group artist’s painting.</p>

<sec id="section7-0261927X12463209">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A two-way independent analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test the effects of the linguistic forms used for nationality labels (nouns vs. adjectives) on intergroup bias in the four different countries (Czech Republic vs. Finland vs. Germany vs. Poland). In line with the hypothesis, a significant main effect of the linguistic form was found: Intergroup bias was higher (<italic>M</italic> = 0.17; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.79) when a noun was used for nationality labels (e.g., a German, a painter) as compared with an adjective (a German painter; <italic>M</italic> = −0.04; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.78); <italic>F</italic>(1, 229) = 3.89, <italic>p</italic> = .05, <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0261927X12463209">

<p>Even though the effect of participants’ country did not reach statistical significance, and thus allows for no further interpretation, the observed pattern is interesting: Finnish, German, and Polish participants showed a preference for the artifact supposedly originating from a painter of their own nationality in the noun condition, but not in the adjective condition. Czech participants, however, showed no bias in the noun condition, but a small, nonsignificant out-group bias (i.e., a relative preference of the out-group painter’s artifact) in the adjective condition.</p>

<sec id="section8-0261927X12463209">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In line with our hypothesis, Study 1 showed that linguistic forms vary in their effect on intergroup bias. The use of nouns for labels of a group membership led to a preference of in-group artifacts as compared with a group membership labeled with adjectives. The results of Study 1, though small in terms of effect size, are highly relevant as they were found in the joint examination of four samples from four countries speaking four different languages.</p>
<p>However, Study 1 has two main limitations. First, the experimental task was quite artificial. Second, the wording of the stimulus material in Study 1 was rather unnatural and did not correspond with usual ways of expressing group membership in everyday life for example, in newspapers or other media. Thus, we conducted Study 2 to replicate the results from Study 1 in a more real-life context that is relevant for participants. As the effect of linguistic forms on intergroup bias in Study 1 gave the least clear picture in the Czech subsample, we ran Study 2 with Czech participants.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section9-0261927X12463209">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>Study 2 examined the level of intergroup bias after reading a report on an intergroup conflict in a sport domain. The nationality of sportsmen in a bogus newspaper article describing a foul during an international football game was labeled by either nouns or adjectives. To control for the effect of perpetrator’s group membership, the fouling player was either an in-group or out-group member. We were interested in the effect of the linguistic forms on subsequent evaluation of the in-group and out-group as wholes.</p>
<p>Social psychological research has shown individual differences in the evaluation of in-group and out-groups. A cue variable in this context is in-group identification, pertaining to the individual level of interconnectedness with one’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12463209">Brewer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12463209">Crisp &amp; Beck, 2005</xref>). People strongly identifying with their group are chronically concerned about their in-group (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X12463209">Riek, Mania, &amp; Gaertner, 2006</xref>), while low identifiers share this concern only under certain conditions, for example when category salience is heightened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261927X12463209">Sniderman &amp; Hagendoorn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261927X12463209">Veenstra &amp; Haslam, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that nouns make categories more salient (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12463209">Allport, 1954</xref>), we hypothesized that they will exert their influence primarily over low identified group members. At the same time, high identifiers, generally prone to intergroup bias, should be relatively unaffected by the use of nouns for nationality labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261927X12463209">Jetten, Spears, &amp; Postmes, 2004</xref>). Thus, Study 2 examined the relationship between linguistic forms and intergroup bias with a focus on the moderating role of in-group identification. Generally, we expected that nouns used for nationality labels would enhance the in-group preference. We assumed that this effect would be independent of perpetrator’s group membership as a mere description of one isolated misbehavior by individual in-group or out-group members is unlikely to change the direction of participant’s intergroup preferences. Furthermore, we anticipated that the effect of linguistic forms on intergroup bias would be particularly pronounced in participants with low national identification.</p>

<sec id="section11-0261927X12463209">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample comprised 431 university students (<italic>M</italic> = 22.51 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.54; ranging from 19 to 49 years; 27% male). All participants were of Czech nationality and stated Czech as their native language.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0261927X12463209">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>In a web-based experiment, participants were presented with a bogus newspaper report of unsportsmanlike conduct. During an international football match, a player of one nationality committed a harsh foul against a player of a different nationality. Czech players represented the in-group whereas Germans represented the out-group. We manipulated linguistic forms denoting players’ nationalities using either nouns (e.g., a defending German) or adjectives (e.g., a German defender). To control for the intervening effect of perpetrator’s group membership, we created two parallel stories—one with an in-group perpetrator and another with an out-group perpetrator. The two between-participants manipulations resulted in four conditions with an in-group/out-group perpetrator and an out-group/in-group victim, both labeled with either nouns or adjectives. Examples of the bogus newspaper article combining an out-group perpetrator with an in-group victim are in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261927X12463209">appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to estimate the moderating role of participants’ in-group identification, we asked about the endorsement (e.g., “Do you consider yourself to be a Czech?”) and evaluation (e.g., “Are you proud to be a Czech?”) of their group membership. The answering format was a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from <italic>not at all</italic> (1) to <italic>very much</italic> (5).

<p>After reading the newspaper report, participants were asked about their attitudes toward their in-group (own country) and out-group (neighboring country) as wholes.

<p>To test the hypothesis whether the level of participants’ in-group identification moderates the relationship between linguistic forms and intergroup bias, we conducted a hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The dependent variable, intergroup bias, was created by subtracting out-group feelings from the in-group feelings, so that the higher values represented more intergroup bias. In the first step, the model estimating the effect of linguistic forms and identification on intergroup bias was significant, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .22, <italic>F</italic>(2, 428) = 59.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

<p>In the second step of the regression analysis, an interaction term between identification and linguistic forms was entered.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In Study 2, we replicated the effect of linguistic forms on intergroup bias in a more real-life context using more natural language. Unlike Study1, intergroup bias was operationalized on a group level—as a relative difference in attitudes toward the in-group and out-group as wholes. In line with results of Study 1 and our hypothesis, we found that nouns enhanced the relative difference between attitudes toward the in-group and out-group.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Study 2 examined the role of participants’ identification. As predicted, the relationship between linguistic forms and intergroup bias was moderated by in-group identification. Low- and moderately identified participants preferred their in-group to the out-group more when reading an article where nationalities were labeled by nouns. On the other hand, we found no difference in intergroup bias displayed in noun and adjective condition by highly identified participants. The results of Study 2 indicated that not all people are sensitive to the effect of linguistic forms to the same extent. However, as the use of nouns and adjective was found to systematically exert influence over intergroup bias in Study 1 and 2, we wanted to examine its effect also on socially relevant issues.</p>

<title>Study 3</title>
<p>The main aim of Study 3 was to confirm the effect of linguistic forms on existing intergroup phenomena using a large, nationwide, representative sample. As a context of Study 3, we used the issue of material restitution, an important topic of public discourse in Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X12463209">Kozminski, 1997</xref>) and Eastern Europe in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12463209">Blacksell &amp; Born, 2002</xref>). The material restitution touches both Polish Jews as well as ethnic Poles whose descendants claim property that was confiscated during World War II. Such issues as the material restitution are a typical subject of opinion polls and surveys.</p>

Nonetheless, little is known about the effect of more subtle linguistic devices. Based on the findings from Study 1 and 2, we supposed that linguistic forms would influence participants’ responses to questions related to the in-group and out-group. In Study 3, we expected that nouns (as compared with adjectives) used for nationality and ethnicity labels would result in higher intergroup bias expressed as willingness to restitute the property to the in-group but not to the out-group.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions. In both conditions, they received a questionnaire including a measure of opinions about material restitution. Two questions asked to what extent participants would agree with the restitution of private property to former owners of Jewish (Question 1) and Polish (Question 2) ethnicity. Participants responded to both questions on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>completely disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>completely agree</italic>).</p>
<p>In the first condition, the ethnicities in both questions were labeled with nouns: “Would you agree that Jews, owners of the property in pre-war Poland, should receive back their real estate?” and “Would you agree that Poles, owners of the property in pre-war Poland, should receive back their real estate?.” In the second condition, both ethnicities were labeled with adjectives: “Would you agree that Jewish owners of the property in pre-war Poland should receive back their real estate?” and “Would you agree that Polish owners of the property in pre-war Poland should receive back their real estate?.”</p>
<p>The survey included also a 12-item measure of national identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463209">Cameron, 2004</xref>), measured prior to experimental manipulation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the third study supported our hypothesis assuming the effect of linguistic forms used for ethnicity labels on intergroup bias concerning a real-life issue of property restitution. When the ethnicity of a former property owner was labeled with nouns, as compared with adjectives, Polish participants were more inclined to concede the restitution of the confiscated property to Poles, as opposed to Jews. The crucial point is that the effect cannot be limited to either out-group or in-group attitude change, as neither of the simple effects was significant on its own.</p>
<p>However, the effects obtained in Study 3 were relatively small and the moderational role of national identification was not replicated. Thus, it would be premature to perceive different linguistic forms as a crucial source of intergroup biases distorting survey responses. Our findings rather suggest that linguistic forms enhance intergroup bias more than modifying attitudes toward either the out-group or in-group. On the other hand, the effects of linguistic forms were systematically shown across different designs of our three studies and as such should be taken into account while constructing questionnaires and interpreting survey results.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section21-0261927X12463209">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>In a series of three studies, we tested the effect of linguistic forms on intergroup bias. Although nouns and adjectives resemble from morphological as well as semantic perspective, we showed that they lead to different evaluation of intergroup issues. We tested the general assumption that nouns used for nationality or ethnicity labels lead to more pronounced intergroup bias. In Study 1, nouns and adjectives denoted nationality of an in-group and out-group author, whose paintings were to be judged in terms of their aesthetic quality. Intergroup bias resulting from the use of nouns was manifested in a preference of the painting created by an in-group artist to the painting created by an artist of another nationality. The effect of linguistic forms was shown in different languages (i.e., Czech, Finnish, German, Polish), some of which have never been tested before.</p>
<p>In Study 2, participants expressed their attitude toward their in-group and out-group after reading about a conflict of in-group and out-group sportsmen whose nationality was labeled either with nouns or adjectives. Use of nouns led to a more pronounced preference of one’s in-group to the out-group as wholes. Study 2 showed that the effect of linguistic forms pertains also to more complex texts where readers’ attention can be distracted by other linguistic devices than just variation in the use of nouns and adjectives. Furthermore, Study 2 brought evidence on individual differences in susceptibility to the influence of linguistic forms. We found a moderating effect of in-group identification in that only low- and moderately identified participants were prone to the effect of nouns on their expression of intergroup bias. Study 3 shifted its focus to real-life issues. Using a relevant topic of an ongoing societal discourse, we examined participants’ willingness to return confiscated property to former owners from in-group and out-group. If the ethnicity of the owners was labeled with nouns, the readiness to restore their property was higher for in-group as compared with out-group owners.</p>
<p>The role of in-group identification in our studies is ambiguous. In Study 2, we observed intergroup bias resulting from the use of nouns for nationality labels in low and moderately identifying participants, as opposed to high identifiers. However, Study 3 drawing on an existing topic with socially relevant consequences did not confirm the moderational effect of in-group identification. We can assume that hypothetical situations, as the one used in Study 2 (e.g., “imagine a situation of a football game misbehavior . . .”), leave space for group identity and other social factors to influence a newly formed opinion. The effect of situational cues (e.g., the variation in linguistic forms) is then especially pronounced in loosely identifying people that orient themselves on other cues than just a chronic concern about optimal results of intergroup comparison. On the contrary, differences in participants’ level of identification do not play role in well-defined, already encountered evaluations, in which linguistic forms just polarize the direction of already created opinions. This explanation is supported by findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261927X12463209">Grieve and Hogg (1999)</xref> that in undefined, uncertain situations, people rely much more on their group identities. Because of the unequivocal pattern of results of our studies, the moderating role of in-group identification needs further examination in a follow-up research.</p>
<p>A limitation of our results represents the small effect size of linguistic forms, a finding that has been previously presented by other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X12463209">Geschke, Sassenberg, Ruhrmann, &amp; Sommer, 2010</xref>). Thus, the results do not allow perceiving the variation in linguistic forms as a sufficient cause of intergroup bias. The outcomes of our research rather suggest that particular linguistic forms, namely nouns, can enhance or partially contribute to the existing intergroup biases. Despite the small effect sizes, the relevance of our findings is manifested in the robustness of the effect of nouns, as compared with adjectives, on intergroup biases found across different languages, intergroup contexts, and experimental settings.</p>
<p>At the moment, we know very little about mechanisms and processes responsible for the effects of different linguistic forms. Based on previous studies, a prime candidate underlying the effects of nouns in intergroup domain is social categorization. As illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12463209">Carnaghi et al. (2008)</xref>, nouns inhibit alternative categorizations and thus make the particular category membership of the described person more salient. The inclusion into a certain social category is connected to the process of stereotyping that has been also shown to be enhanced by nouns. Furthermore, the use of nouns facilitates more essentialist perception of a target person and thus considering the noun-described characteristics as central for that person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12463209">Carnaghi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12463209">Gelman &amp; Heyman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X12463209">Walton &amp; Banaji, 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, there are also more general cognitive mechanisms, such as the processing style that can be responsible for the different effects of various linguistic forms. Previous research found that behavioral descriptions, as opposed to trait descriptions, elicit deeper, systematic processing of the communicated information resulting in higher attention, better recall, and less expectancy-consistent impressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261927X12463209">Ter Doest, Semin, &amp; Sherman, 2002</xref>). However, the link between nouns and corresponding processing style is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>As illustrated by our research, language is not a mere precondition of intergroup relations. Language not only reflects but also affects the way people perceive and evaluate groups. Following an apt metaphor by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261927X12463209">Sutton (2010)</xref>, language in intergroup domain can be conceived in three different forms—as a vessel that enables transmission of thoughts, as a lens that guides cognition, and as a barometer that is indicative of communicator’s intergroup attitudes. The transmission of communicates from intergroup domain is a main focus of linguistic intergroup bias (LIB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X12463209">Maass, Salvi, Arcuri, &amp; Semin, 1989</xref>). The LIB assumes a link between prejudiced thinking and linguistic forms used in description of behaviors displayed by in-group and out-group members. The LIB builds on the linguistic category model (LCM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261927X12463209">Semin &amp; Fiedler, 1988</xref>) that defines four linguistic categories (i.e., descriptive action verbs, interpretative action verbs, state verbs, and adjectives) differing in their position on the continuum of linguistic concreteness–abstractness. The level of language abstraction influences recipients’ inferences about the stability, predictability, and disputability of described behaviors. The LIB postulates that higher levels of linguistic abstractness (e.g., state verbs and adjectives) are employed in descriptions of positive in-group and negative out-group actions, leading to perception of higher stability and dispositional inferences. On the contrary, negative in-group and positive out-group behavior described with concrete linguistic categories (e.g., descriptive and interpretative action verbs) leads to the perception of situational influences and low stability.</p>
<p>The LIB differs from our research in that it focuses on linguistic preferences of the <italic>communicators</italic>, whereas we were interested in the effect of linguistic forms on <italic>recipients</italic> of communicates. However, the difference between our research and the LIB paradigm reaches beyond the differences in design of the studies. Generally, the LIB determines how intergroup bias manifests in different linguistic forms. In our research, we inverted the logic and studied how the use of different linguistic forms influences intergroup bias. Another important difference pertains to the fact that the LIB as well as the original LCM operates only with verbs and adjectives. In previous research on linguistic abstractness, nouns were classified into the same category with adjectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X12463209">Coenen, Hedebouw, &amp; Semin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X12463209">Maass et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261927X12463209">Semin, &amp; Fiedler, 1988</xref>). However, studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12463209">Carnaghi et al. (2008)</xref> showed that nouns and adjectives have profoundly different psychological consequences. Their research brought evidence that nouns, as compared with adjectives, used for labels of various group memberships and inclinations have higher impact on the activation of stereotypical attributes in person perception. We went a step further, examining the effect of nouns and adjectives on evaluation of group artifacts, groups as wholes, and existing intergroup issues. Our studies have broadened the scope of Carnaghi et al.’s findings on the inductive potential of nouns in person perception to the domain of intergroup relations. We showed that the effects of group membership in evaluation of intergroup issues can be enhanced by linguistic factors, namely the use of nouns and adjectives.</p>
<p>Variations in linguistic forms describing category membership can have numerous practical consequences. For instance, the use of different linguistic forms can be used as an indicator of implicit prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261927X12463209">Franco &amp; Maass, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X12463209">1999</xref>) as epitomized by the “barometer metaphor” describing one of the functions of language in intergroup context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261927X12463209">Sutton, 2010</xref>). It has been shown that communicators who use more abstract language are perceived as more biased against people whom they are describing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X12463209">Douglas &amp; Sutton, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12463209">2010</xref>). Based on these findings, we suppose that the use of nouns for category labels in questionnaires can inform participants of prejudiced attitudes held by the researchers. Participants’ perceptions can result in their expression of higher levels of prejudice because of their compliance with the researcher. Such a normative influence of linguistic forms used in psychological research deserves further attention. Nevertheless, there are also other contexts where language use leading to intergroup bias has more far-reaching consequences, such as in mass media. Biased communication in mass media is of high relevance, given its potential to reach a vast number of recipients at the same time, and interethnic processes are affected by very subtle differences in perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X12463209">Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12463209">Maass et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore, even small changes or polarization of existing intergroup attitudes resulting from the use of different linguistic forms—as shown in our studies—can have considerable impact with regard to intergroup relations.</p>

<td>In last minutes of a deciding match between the Czech Republic and Germany, football fans witnessed a harsh foul. A forwarding Czech appeared in a promising situation which would with a high probability lead to a goal and thus to the win of the Czech national team. However, a defending German stopped the Czech before he was able to shoot. The German attacked the member of the competing team in a harsh way.
