<abstract>
<p>How and why does culture change? Very often, our meaningful priorities change as a result of accidental circumstances and external factors. But what about <italic>endogenous</italic> cultural change, when the values that matter to us are reinterpreted from our mulling them over? In these instances, our beliefs may not change randomly but in a progressively patterned way, as we gain greater clarity on the character of our primary commitments and search for coherence in their empirical application. This article outlines one model of endogenous cultural change, using Hegel’s discussion of the dialectical dynamism of liberal culture as an example. In the process, I argue Hegel’s endogenous model can enrich the meaning of reflexivity in anthropology. For Hegel, reflexivity is less about loosening our attachment to our initially contingent ideals as it is about perfecting them.</p>

<p>Is freedom an empty word, a temptation, designed to ruin man and his works, or can man reassert his freedom in the face of that knowledge and strive for its fulfillment in society without lapsing into moral illusionism? The discovery of society is thus either the end or the rebirth of freedom. (Karl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1463499612469584">Polanyi 2001</xref>: 267)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1463499612469584">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>
<p>This article explores Hegel’s analysis of liberal culture and explains why he thinks this culture periodically generates dissatisfaction with itself at an individual and sometimes collective level. By culture I mean moral orders that colour our thoughts, feelings, and actions. Liberal culture here refers to a specific moral order in which the goal of individuals emancipated from others to make choices as they please is given priority over other ideals. Hence the variety of values and virtues which have been at the core of other cultures – the Ancient Greek preoccupation with Beauty; the Renaissance concern with <italic>virtú</italic>; the Christian emphasis on <italic>agape</italic> (charity); or warrior cultures exalting courage – are secondary in liberal culture to the concern with freedom, which as an ideal morally occupies pride of place vis-à-vis the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1463499612469584">Taylor 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Hegel understands himself as the thinker who first identifies the reasons for the self-subverting character of liberal culture – and also the first philosopher who indicates the possibility for positively answering its deepest self-doubts (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1463499612469584">Pangle 1983</xref>: 45). One of the common but troublesome turns of thought Hegel observes among some liberals is for their idealizing of a free self to occasionally morph into the ideal of freedom from ‘self’ and from freedom itself. The terminus to which this inauspicious mental path leads is a species of scepticism he terms ‘unhappy consciousness’. Anticipating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1463499612469584">Nietzsche’s (2003)</xref> discussion of nihilism, Hegel defines unhappy consciousness as a person who has lost all meaning, ‘the grief which expresses itself in the hard saying that “God is dead”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1463499612469584">Hegel 1977</xref>: 454–5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1463499612469584">2</xref></sup> More precisely, unhappy consciousness can be defined as ‘a worldview whose meaningful norms have been sufficiently undermined by sceptical reproach so the individual can no longer really believe in them, yet cannot envision an alternative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1463499612469584">Pinkard 1996</xref>: 274).</p>
<p>In this article I argue that Hegel’s discussion of liberal culture and unhappy consciousness can enrich ongoing debates about reflexivity in anthropology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1463499612469584">Scholte 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1463499612469584">Clifford and Marcus 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1463499612469584">Okely and Callaway 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1463499612469584">Hervik 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1463499612469584">Ryang 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1463499612469584">Denzin 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1463499612469584">Salzman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1463499612469584">Robbins 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1463499612469584">Hammersley and Atkinson 2010</xref>). As defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1463499612469584">Rose (2007: 136)</xref>, reflexivity is the attempt ‘to resist the universalizing claims of academic knowledge and to insist that academic knowledge is situated and partial’. By most accounts, the ‘reflexive turn’ in anthropology started in the 1980s with belated recognition by socio-cultural anthropology of its historic role in colonialism (Jacobs-Huey 2006: 791). This recognition heightened sensitivity among anthropologists as to how their presence in the field and the publication of their findings can recursively reconstitute the lives of the people they study, either for good or for ill. The ‘reflexive turn’ also intensified interest in how research changes the researcher, as well as how the biography and background of the researcher influences research results. Hence reflexivity means introspectively asking ‘about the role of ethnographic production in the political and social spaces within which anthropologists operate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1463499612469584">Kahn 2001</xref>: 654; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1463499612469584">Lynch 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>However, my claim is that reflexive anthropology has ironically not been reflexive enough.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1463499612469584">3</xref></sup> Specifically, the new reflexive anthropology has not sufficiently viewed itself as participants in a longer intellectual conversation within liberal culture. Consider the almost total neglect of Hegel in anthropological debates about reflexivity, despite his voluminous writings on this topic. This neglect cannot be innocently written-off because of modern disciplinary divisions. Rather, it implies reflexive anthropology has often failed on its own terms to grasp ‘reflexivity’ as a specifically situated ideal consistent with a liberal culture which valorizes the ideal of self-aware, self-legislating individuals. ‘Reflexivity’, I argue, is most promising if we view it not only as a research strategy which helps us better understand cultural ‘others’ but also as an intellectual move informing us about our own (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1463499612469584">Argyrou 2003</xref>). In particular, the ‘romance with reflexivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1463499612469584">Pels 2000</xref>: 2) is closely related historically to concerns among liberal individuals with attaining freedom.</p>
<p>Many scholars have emphasized the progressive role of liberal culture and the ideal of freedom, and with good reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1463499612469584">Friedman 1962</xref>). Freedom and its associated vocabulary of autonomy and emancipation have proven potent as conceptual tools, particularly for the historically dispossessed. However, this fact should not obscure the way freedom can become mystified as a false foundation. It is wrong, for instance, to regard freedom as a universal ideal in the face of ethnographic evidence that it is either a foreign or under-prioritized norm in some cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1463499612469584">MacFarlane 1978</xref>; Strathern 1988). Furthermore, freedom can <italic>function</italic> ideologically when it is used rhetorically to justify positions that foster its opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1463499612469584">Žižek 2005</xref>: 118–19).</p>
<p>In this article I argue that while Hegel affirms freedom as the supreme ideal for liberals, he also implies that holding this value primary paradoxically thrusts us towards appreciating the importance of other values as well. On one hand, individual freedom is ‘the principle of the modern world’ and Hegel rightly judged any society which did not recognize this fact as ‘unacceptable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1463499612469584">Hegel as quoted in Villa 2005</xref>: 660). On the other hand, Hegel also argued that liberal culture often suffers from an error in the other direction. Liberal persons have abandoned older, one-sided conceptions of the individual as a mere cog in a cultural totality only to adopt another self-conception equally but oppositely one-sided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1463499612469584">Schacht 1971</xref>: 50). The forms these distorted personalities assume are many and Hegel’s genius resided in grasping their commonality. Note, however, that I am less interested in endorsing all of Hegel’s views than I am with offering an exposition. As I argue below, even if one disagrees with specific aspects of Hegel’s analysis of liberal culture, his broader effort to explain cultural change endogenously offers a valuable example which contemporary anthropology might try to replicate.</p>
<p>Here, then, a roadmap for the rest of the article. I begin by discussing some key features of Hegel’s philosophy. Although Hegel is a name well-known to socio-cultural anthropologists, his insights are relatively neglected by them in their research publications. Thus a search of the Anthropology Plus database in 2010 using Hegel as a keyword yielded 18 results, scant compared to Marx (244 results), Foucault (169 results), and Kant (51 results). When Hegel is cited by anthropologists, the appraisal of his work is almost entirely negative. Thus a recent piece in <italic>Cultural Anthropology</italic> remarked that ‘Hegel is not just generally untrue but precisely so’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1463499612469584">Aravamudan 2012</xref>). This hostile reception to Hegel is surprising considering that his emphasis on purposefulness as a causal variable should clearly resonate with socio-cultural anthropologists. Hence one of the goals of this article is to encourage an anthropological ‘return to Hegel’ that does not read him only as the foil of later critical theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1463499612469584">Marx 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1463499612469584">Bloch 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1463499612469584">Harvey 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The first part of this article is therefore concerned with differentiating Hegel’s dialectical discussion of liberal culture from critiques common in critical theory. I also contrast Hegel’s model for explaining cultural change with other alternatives. The key argument I advance is that many models in socio-cultural anthropology explain cultural change by resorting to an <italic>exogenous</italic> factor. These include Kantian-inspired explanations that posit a ‘real’ which returns to wreck representations; theories premised on ‘subjective excess’ that recur to agentive ‘interests,’ ‘interpretations,’ and ‘resistance’ outside the culture analysed; as well as models that avail themselves of a second culture to explain mutations of the first, as in theories of ‘assemblage,’ ‘hybridity,’ and ‘recombination’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1463499612469584">Deleuze and Guattari 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1463499612469584">Bhabha 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1463499612469584">Stark 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>By contrast, Hegel offers an <italic>endogenous</italic> explanation that identifies catalysts of cultural change as coming from within it. Such change occurs when a culture’s dominant ideal contains a conceptual breach which, if mined and exploited, and extended to its paradoxical precipice, inspires the culture to articulate more fitting formulations of the ideal. This ‘trans-valuation of values’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1463499612469584">Deleuze 1983</xref>) can, retrospectively, be viewed as inhering as a probable or ‘determinate’ trajectory of the initial values themselves. Thus when Hegel writes about ‘logical necessity’ he seems to be arguing that ‘new’ beliefs have their origins in our early ones, even if, later on, through the eyes of the convert, these new ideals appear wholly unconnected to the old. Yet, crucially for Hegel, it is only when we can author an integrated and ordered story about our self that links the various views we have held to one another, and sees their relation to broader historical patterns, are we culturally mature and capable of living cognitively coherent lives. It is this fully reflexive and reconciled psychological state which Hegel terms absolute self-knowledge: ‘to take what thought has torn asunder and then stir it all together into a smooth mélange’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1463499612469584">Hegel 2008</xref>: 7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1463499612469584">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Part 2 of the article applies Hegel’s endogenous model for thinking about the contradictions that undermine the reasonableness of a blunt notion of freedom construed as doing whatever one pleases. According to Hegel, a culture that exalts the freedom of the self to choose is the midwife of a culture where the ‘self’ is itself viewed as an object of choice. Here I suggest Hegel offers a convincing theory for the passage from ‘modernity’ to ‘post-modernity’, with those terms reconceived less as period containers and more as characteristic types of liberal personalities. Specifically, I focus on Hegel’s description of unhappy consciousness because I discern elements of it in some of the more intense strains of ‘postmodern’ criticism in socio-cultural anthropology, which then inflects debates about reflexivity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1463499612469584">Povinelli 2001</xref> for an overview). As defined by Hegel, unhappy consciousness manifests itself in a sceptical liberal person who comes necessarily to be sceptical about the value of its own scepticism. As we will see, the <italic>aporia</italic> unhappy consciousness finds itself in should inspire a more self-reflexive framing of its mindset as expressing a common but dead-end trajectory thought sometimes takes in liberal culture (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1463499612469584">Butler 1997</xref>: 31–62).</p>
<p>The limits of an undercooked concept of freedom manifest themselves not only upon reasoned introspection by individuals. Its consequences can also actualize themselves in the broader course of social life. Hegel’s arguments may therefore help anthropologists explain the contemporary conundrum that the triumph of liberal norms has in some places been accompanied by disenchantment with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1463499612469584">Comaroff and Comaroff 2000</xref>). His claims may also shed light on why ‘Enlightened civilization can revert to barbarism in the name of Enlightenment’, i.e. freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1463499612469584">Horkheimer and Adorno 2010</xref>: xvi). As I argue, freedom fundamentalism may not be a contradiction in terms: the fanaticism that sometimes afflicts liberal cultures should not be explained merely as the recrudescence of an illiberal past.</p>
<p>In concluding, I speculate on the direction a reflexive refashioning of liberal culture might take today. I observe that Hegel shifts our task from a wholly negative critique of reality to reconciliation with it – a reconciliation that is not, however, mere capitulation, but is brokered on terms such that both critic and culture are enriched and transformed. I thus read in Hegel an opportunity for anthropology to rework its concept of reflexivity. Specifically, I advocate for anthropologists excavating the liberal ideal of freedom in search of its deeper moral motivations. Like distilling and drinking a fine wine, reflexivity within the current context involves careful digestion by anthropologists of their liberal cultural tradition in order to unlock its deepest critical potential.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1463499612469584">5</xref></sup> By making this move, anthropologists can become catalysts for improving the culture from which their vocation springs.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1463499612469584"><title>Dialectic of Enlightenment</title>
<p>An article-length discussion of Hegel is a difficult task considering his insistence that no part of his philosophy could be adequately understood outside engaging his whole corpus. A few key features of his philosophy must therefore be indicated. A relevant starting point is to contrast Hegel’s critical method with that common in critical theory. Generally, critical theorists critique liberal culture for failing to realize the ideal of freedom <italic>empirically</italic>, but do not engage in a <italic>philosophical</italic> critique of freedom per se (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1463499612469584">Brown 1995</xref>: 106; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1463499612469584">Žižek 2005</xref>: 130; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1463499612469584">Habermas 1987</xref>). Instead, the goal which most critical theory takes as its aim is making the rhetoric of freedom more of a reality in different spheres of social life.</p>
<p>Hegel’s move is different. At times, he calls into question the value of freedom construed as the individual doing whatever they please, which Hegel disparages as ‘caprice’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1463499612469584">Hegel 2004</xref>: 38; 2005: xxxix). Hegel’s argument is in part that the ideal of absolute autonomy is utopian. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1463499612469584">Taylor (2007</xref>: 479) has nicely put it, ‘It is clear that to have any kind of livable society some choices have to be restricted, some authorities have to be respected, and some individual responsibility has to be assumed. The issue should always be which choices, authorities, and responsibilities, and at what cost.’ Hence, for Hegel, as for Taylor, a gap between a crude notion of freedom and its actual realization necessarily exists, symptomatic of the uncultivated character of the ideal itself. Here Hegel’s aim is not to deny the value of freedom but to further specify its meaning (Hegel’s <italic>aufhebung</italic>). As I elaborate below, Hegel wants to show that the ideal of individual freedom only roughly approximates an embedded ethics in liberal culture that is much richer.</p>
<p>Hegel’s critique of an unqualified ideal of freedom is most powerful in a section of the <italic>Phenomenology of Spirit</italic> entitled ‘Absolute freedom and terror’, where he links the liberal culture of the French Revolution with the subsequent Jacobin terrorism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1463499612469584">Schmidt 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1463499612469584">Wokler 1998</xref> for extended discussions). Some philosophers have argued that the French Terror has its sources in ‘rationalism’, arguing that its seeds were sown at the outset of the Revolution by the hubristic effort to replace <italic>‘sui generis’</italic> social systems with those designed ‘<italic>a priori</italic>’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1463499612469584">Hayek 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499612469584">Burke 2009</xref>). While Hegel might have been sympathetic to such arguments, his analysis of ‘absolute-freedom-and-terror’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1463499612469584">Comay 2004</xref>) also identifies the sources of this social disaster with greater specificity:<disp-quote>
<p>To Rousseau is to be ascribed the merit of discovering and presenting a principle … of the individual will. … Thus the union of individuals in a state becomes a contract, which is based upon caprice, opinion, and optional, explicit consent. … But as the undertaking was begun with abstractions void of all ideas, it ended in scenes of tragic cruelty and horror. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1463499612469584">Hegel 2005</xref>: 133–4)</p></disp-quote>In Hegel’s account, the French Terror is thus the result of a particular rationalist project: the imposition of a culture of caprice and institutional forms compatible with it, namely bare-bone contract models of society. So long as individuals imagine themselves as atomistic rights-bearing individuals contingently bonded to each other, they might come to feel even the most minimal responsibilities to others as constraining their freedom. ‘In their unfettered freedom’, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1463499612469584">Hegel (1977</xref>: 292), individuals ‘become elemental beings raging madly against one another in a frenzy of destructive activity’. This interpretation of self and society – what I term freedom fundamentalism – can erode the basis for meaningful community to the point of tearing it apart.</p>
<p>Observe how Hegel is seeking to explain cultural change <italic>endogenously</italic>; in this case, how liberal culture can be undermined on the basis of its own contradictory logic. By contrast, most models of cultural change in anthropology today explain cultural change <italic>exogenously</italic>, by reference to shocks from technology, demography or organizational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1463499612469584">Kaufman 2004</xref>: 336). Arguably this is because much socio-cultural anthropology proceeds from Kantian and neo-Kantian premises that a gap <italic>necessarily</italic> exists between representations and the real world. These explanations of cultural change are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1463499612469584">Kantian in that they follow from Kant’s (2004)</xref> basic argument that a gap exists between phenomena and noumena; signifier and signified; words and the world to which they refer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1463499612469584">6</xref></sup> This gap then marks the site where familiar concepts can become confused and undone when they fail to fully present the truth of the empirical contingencies they encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1463499612469584">Sahlins 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1463499612469584">Adorno 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1463499612469584">Latour 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1463499612469584">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>By contrast, in Hegel’s cultural theory, the internal development of a culture is inspired at paradoxical moments where two equally reasoned results grounded in a culture’s ideals come into conflict. These simultaneous, contradictory conclusions mark the uneasy and highly fraught tipping points where a culture can unravel; or, on the upshot, a critical threshold that allows it to cultivate more conscious and coherent principles. For instance, in a culture where freedom is the highest ideal, a reasonable conclusion, true to the culture’s own terms, is that this culture must defend the freedom to surrender it, or freedom means nothing at all (to echo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1463499612469584">Žižek 2002</xref>: 545). In other words, the biggest threat to contradictory cultural orders is not rejecting their ideals but taking them seriously to their logical but paradoxical conclusions, a move Hegel refers to as a <italic>determinate</italic> negation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1463499612469584">8</xref></sup> These are the defining dilemmas and deadlocks where a culture’s inner antitheses can undermine it. The actual realization of these endemic antagonisms in the world is not ineluctable. They are nevertheless logically latent and hence ‘rationally necessary’. For Hegel, such contradictory conclusions indicate a culture’s own philosophic inadequacy according to its own internal standards, and should inspire an effort to reformulate, rephrase, and clarify that culture in a more reasonably coherent way.</p>
<p>The contrast between Hegel’s explanation for cultural change and the explanation offered for ruptures by anthropologists working in the spirit of Derrida’s deconstruction should also be stated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1463499612469584">Morris 2007</xref> for an overview). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1463499612469584">Derrida (1998)</xref> builds from Saussure’s argument that cultural signs are relational and radicalizes this argument by claiming that ultimate meaning is therefore deferred interminably by infinite regress – Derrida’s <italic>différance</italic>. Since signs have no self-sufficient ‘presence’ they are by nature polysemic and protean, hence continually open to reinvention. However, the deconstructionist explanation for cultural change is ironically a-cultural because the source driving such change is the <italic>universal</italic> instability of semiotic frameworks <italic>as such</italic>. Derrida and those working from his insights are committed to a view that a formal structural feature of semiotic systems that has no meaning (<italic>différance</italic>) can adequately explain the meaningful reasons when and why particular cultures change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1463499612469584">Dews 1995</xref>: 3–4). The same critique can be made of anthropologists who state as a general proposition that ‘culture’ (which?) is unbounded and porous, hence open to change.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Hegel argues that the specific sites of semantic instability cannot be identified outside understanding a <italic>particular</italic> culture’s concrete content and the meaningful dilemmas thus generated. If cultural change is to be adequately understood, it must be traced from within the meaningful world of those embodying it – hence the need for a phenomenology and indeed anthropology. For instance, in a liberal culture that idealizes the self making its own choices, a radical but reasoned inference is that ‘the self’ can itself be the object of choice. This is a remarkable conclusion and specific in terms of its prevalence to liberal culture (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1463499612469584">Sökefeld 1999</xref>). The idea that we are, in the memorable phrase of Milton Friedman, ‘free to choose’ our identity makes little sense in other cultures, where identities are self-consciously patterned in terms of kinship roles and national identities, or where it is assumed there is only one ‘right’ identity for the self to assume as universally pre-specified by God or Nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1463499612469584">Strauss 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1463499612469584">MacIntyre 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A person brought up believing they are free thus faces identity crises very different from those in cultures that explicitly tell them what they ought to be. Hence we are mistaken to assume that the same existential paradox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1463499612469584">Kierkegaard 1992</xref>) plagues all people. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1463499612469584">Taylor (2007</xref>: 303) has observed, people have historically suffered not from the liberal ‘search for meaning’ but from an ‘excess’ of it: ‘the sense of one over-bearing issue – e.g. “am I saved or damned” – which would not leave them alone’ (with a nod to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1463499612469584">Weber 1992</xref>). However, the absolutely free person which posits itself as an object of choice ends up in an ambiguous <italic>aporia</italic> without normative criteria by which to judge rival options. In tandem with the development of a social order characterized by a complex division of labour, the question ‘who should I be and why?’ acquires greater salience and urgency in contemporary liberal culture. Hegel signals this acute impasse with the tragic figure of unhappy consciousness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1463499612469584"><title>Unhappy consciousness</title>
<p>In this section I detail how Hegel applies his model of endogenous cultural change to explaining the dynamics of liberal culture. Specifically, Hegel demonstrates that a liberal culture idealizing a free self facilitates the emergence of the ideal of freedom from self. Here Hegel offers a particularly persuasive theory for why a culture that idealizes the sovereign, self-identical person can explode into a culture idealizing the de-centred subject, where loss of identity is celebrated as liberation, and ‘the disruption of identities, self-annihilation, and political plurality become ends in themselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1463499612469584">Dews 1995</xref>: 359; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1463499612469584">Bersani 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1463499612469584">Deleuze and Guattari 1987</xref>). Stated another way, Hegel reveals a secret affinity between liberal individualists and their postmodern critics, while explaining the passage from modernity to post-modernity <italic>avant la lettre</italic>, arguing that the latter is an entropic phase in the development of the former (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1463499612469584">Jameson 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1463499612469584">Harvey 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Here my ‘presentist’ reading of Hegel might strike some readers as inappropriate and requires some defense. Briefly, my reading hinges on viewing ‘post-modernity’ as, in fact, part of a reoccurring pattern of melancholy in liberal culture for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1463499612469584">Pippin 1999</xref>). The very fact that so many of Hegel’s philosophical personages anticipate and resemble theoretical strands today offers evidence for this claim. Furthermore, Hegel’s own approach to cultural history was self-consciously ‘presentist’. His philosophy of history explores liberal Enlightenment culture as it has been developing, in fits and spurts, across many centuries with contributions from all over the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1463499612469584">Hegel 2004</xref>: 11). The historical constituents of this culture are therefore those for whom freedom has mediated self-evaluations and inspired social action, in various gradations of reflexive consciousness; and its future constituents will be, Hegel predicts, the whole world. Nevertheless, I scrap Hegel’s assumptions that liberal culture today has a particular geographical centre (‘the West’) or scope (‘the world’). These revisions do not affect his critical insight on the mental road to moral maturation travelled by those who live within a culture where freedom is their highest aspiration.</p>
<p>According to Hegel, many people historically and, in general, unreflectively identify with ruling norms; they obey tradition simply because it is defended as tradition. Such individuals exhibit a high level of cognitive certainty in their cultural ideals even if their naivety demonstrates a low level of reflexive maturity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1463499612469584">Figure 1</xref>). However, liberal culture is arguably unique in that its highest shared ideal effectively disavows its existence. Each individual is encouraged to be free and pursue their own idiosyncratic preferences. On one hand, Hegel views the evolving cleavage between private individuals and a self-consciously explicit public culture as a positive development in humanity’s step toward cognitive maturation. On the other, he often describes this world as ‘profoundly ruptured with itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1463499612469584">Hegel 2004</xref>: 282): ‘what seems to be the public order is [a] universal feud’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1463499612469584">Hegel 2008</xref>: 338).

</fig></p>
<p>Liberal culture thus provokes and encompasses a variety of diverse characteristic personalities and each of these standpoints may be held by a single individual at different moments in the same life. Nevertheless, many of these characters share certain insufficiencies. Most striking is the connection Hegel draws between material hedonists and hipster ascetics, a connection which commentators on our own present have noted empirically and for which Hegel offers an interpretive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1463499612469584">Lasch 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1463499612469584">Brooks 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1463499612469584">Lloyd 2005</xref>). Both hedonists and those Hegel sarcastically terms ‘beautiful souls’ are obsessed with their autonomy at the expense of others, in one case pursuing it through personal consumption, and in the other case through various programs of spiritual salvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1463499612469584">Hegel 2004</xref>: 317). The tragedy is that their pursuits will prove unsatisfying. Viewed from the standpoint of absolute autonomy, any particular object consumed, or any finite personality performed, will prove unfulfilling, given the infinite range of possibilities. In other words, determinate attachments create dependencies on specific objects and subjects these persons fear most. Hedonists are hence condemned to a ceaseless cycle of consumption, while hipsters float from one ‘cause’ to another, without becoming seriously committed to any of them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1463499612469584">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hegel chastises this form of ‘negative freedom’ as ‘that of the void’ which ‘reckons any content as a limit, and flees from it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1463499612469584">Hegel 2005</xref>: xxxii). Since the highest ideal for these liberals is not a particular choice but the act of choosing, any concrete choice can be interpreted as capricious and constraining, considering the continuum of existential possibilities (hints of this pathos in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1463499612469584">Geertz 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1463499612469584">Butler 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1463499612469584">Cheng 2001</xref>). Since all perspectives are viewed as limited and limiting, they can each appear equally partial and pointlessly arbitrary (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1463499612469584">Rorty 2008</xref>). This sets thought in train along tracks toward believing that the freest position is not holding one at all – to permanently stand in a state of critical suspension, at the interstices of ‘undecidability’ (as in Derrida 1994).</p>
<p>It is within this cultural plane that among some liberals scepticism takes hold. The liberal sceptic is characteristically a person who has renounced ‘truth’ altogether without having yet questioned the truth of itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1463499612469584">Berthold-Bond 1998</xref>). The liberal sceptic thus happily assumes the role of permanent opposition. For the sceptic, ‘It is not the subject-matter which is excellent, but I am the excellent thing, am master of law and fact  … and toy with them at my pleasure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1463499612469584">Hegel 2005</xref>: 72). But this smugness conceals the sceptic’s own parasitic relation to his cultural context. More, its performance by the sceptic is designed to conceal the fatal flaw at their core – that it denounces all truth in order to assert its own. What is really being affirmed as true is the freedom of this self, ‘the prodigious power of subjectivity to undo all the potential allegiances which might bind it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1463499612469584">Taylor 1989</xref>: 489).</p>
<p>However, any honest scepticism must treat itself sceptically, thereby generating ‘the vertigo of a perpetually self-creating disorder’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1463499612469584">Hegel 2008</xref>: 185). Such ‘unhappy consciousness’ represents a person sufficiently sceptical to doubt the meaning of their own critical attitude. Here Hegel’s figure of the unhappy consciousness parallels and prefigures Dostoyevsky’s (2009) ‘underground man’ and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1463499612469584">Nietzsche’s (2003)</xref> ‘nihilist’. As with Nietzsche’s nihilist, but for significantly different reasons, Hegel’s unhappy consciousness is ‘the logical conclusion of our great values and ideals’ (Nietzsche, as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1463499612469584">Reginster 2006</xref>: 32). While representing an advance in terms of cognitive maturity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1463499612469584">Figure 1</xref>), this further undermines certainty in consciousness and the liberal culture in which it is embedded. Having pursued the most subliminal freedom, unhappy consciousness finds itself in the lowliest and loneliest confinement: ‘It stands immediately before this most inward abyss, before this groundless depth, in which all foothold and substance have vanished, and in these depths it sees nothing but a common thing, a game for its vagaries, an accident of its arbitrary choices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1463499612469584">Hegel 2008</xref>: 469). For the unhappy liberal consciousness all truths are false, but its fiction rings falsest of all because it is blocked from the blissful ignorance enjoyed by others.</p>
<p>The empty abyss unhappy consciousness finds itself in should motivate it to reflexively understand itself not simply as an agentive subject but also a liberal cultural ‘object.’ Doing so results in the standpoint of self-reflexive reason. Hegel’s narrative structure is thus properly dialectical (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1463499612469584">Comaroff and Comaroff 2003</xref>): the point of departure (cognitive certainty) is also the point of return, with the difference that the certainty of consciousness is no longer naïve but has advanced through radical doubt to a higher level of cognitive maturity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1463499612469584">Figure 1</xref>). Specifically, unhappy consciousness now understands its own personal experience as part of a broader liberal cultural narrative. In my reading, Hegel’s basic argument is that this is the phase when a liberal person understands that their understanding of freedom needs to be reframed and made more exact – and that their own culture possesses the conceptual resources to help make it so.</p>
<p>In so arguing, Hegel’s theory makes critique, creative action, and cultural change within liberal societies endogenous. Hegel’s theory therefore departs from a number of influential perspectives in socio-cultural anthropology which, in order to explain critique and cultural change, resort to an exogenous theory of agency that figures individuals as possessing ‘interests’ and ‘interpretations’ they bring to bear on culture but whose source is under-theorized (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1463499612469584">Bourdieu 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1463499612469584">Sahlins 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1463499612469584">Appadurai 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1463499612469584">Miller 2005</xref>). Similarly, Hegel’s theory is different from recent and insightful contributions based on Lacanian psychoanalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1463499612469584">Lacan 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1463499612469584">Žižek 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1463499612469584">Stavrakakis 1999</xref>) that assume subject formation is always incomplete and partial, and hence there remains part of the person exterior to culture from which resistance springs (Lacan’s <italic>objet petit a</italic>).</p>
<p>Rather than arguing that change and contingency come from outside liberal culture, Hegel locates them within it. The implication of Hegel’s thesis is the following: a determinate critique of a culture from within that culture means the normative motivation behind the critique is itself a product of that cultural context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1463499612469584">10</xref></sup> Although the critic and her culture may at first appear opposed, this is not the case.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1463499612469584">11</xref></sup> Instead, a culture’s previously taken-for-granted views of its own norms partially expressed but veiled a more refined set of norms encompassed and improved upon by using the critic’s vocabulary, which has been immanently developed. By extracting the underlying values beneath these terms and giving them new voice, the critic transforms not only that culture but also her place within it. The critic, who previously seemed exterior to that culture, turns out as most faithful to its fundamental principles. This critical conceptual breakthrough further motivates concrete action to reform society according to these refined norms. Indeed, the conceptual breakthrough inspires the self-assurance required for action (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1463499612469584">Bromley 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1463499612469584">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The difficult question is whether Hegel viewed this mechanism of endogenous change as valid across all human societies or exclusive to the formation and progression of liberal culture. Marx, for instance, famously chided Hegel for treating dialectics as the logic of history <italic>en toto</italic> rather than a method specific to grasping one particular cultural order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1463499612469584">Marx 1976</xref>: 102). But Marx’s accusation seems to me unfair.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1463499612469584">13</xref></sup> Recall Hegel’s famous remark in the preface to <italic>The Philosophy of Right</italic> stating that conceptual comprehension of reality lags behind reality itself, that ‘the owl of Minerva takes its flight only at sunset’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1463499612469584">Hegel 2005</xref>: xxi). This statement can be read in the standard way, as Hegel asserting philosophy cannot teach the world what ought to be but can only reflect upon what already is. But it can also be read more subtlety, as indicating that the social order Hegel subsequently describes in <italic>The Philosophy of Right</italic> – characterized by the predominance of inalienable property, the patriarchal family, and the political monarchy – was itself at sunset; in other words, that Hegel’s conceptual articulation of this social system itself signaled its overcoming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1463499612469584">Pippin 2008</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>Hence Hegel’s own sense of his historicity may have been more balanced than either conventional Left (Marx) or Right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1463499612469584">Fukuyama 1992</xref>) readings have allowed. Hegel detected that he was both at the completion of one particular moment in the history of liberal culture and at the start of another; indeed, he once wrote that ‘our own epoch is a time of birth and a transition to a new period’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1463499612469584">Hegel 2008</xref>: 10). As such, Hegel understood himself, and should be understood, as an intellectual midwife inducing apprehension of these changing cultural circumstances, while at the same time never implying some ultimate utopia could be reached precisely because each individual within liberal culture must travel this phenomenological path alone and make it matter as their own.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1463499612469584"><title>The ‘unfinished dialectic’</title>
<p>What then is the spirit or <italic>Sittlichkeit</italic> (ethical life) we can distill from liberal culture? Suffice to say that limitations on space and skill mean I can only offer suggestions (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1463499612469584">Pippin 2008</xref>). One possibility is that our very fidelity to freedom continually beckons us beyond liberal culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1463499612469584">Glendinning 2009</xref>); in other words, we remain faithful to freedom precisely because we embrace other virtues to complement it, such as courage, compassion, and citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1463499612469584">Bennett 1994</xref>). In this sense, by documenting the wide range of values held by humans, anthropology is an exemplary liberal vocation. Indeed I would argue that it has played a significant role in constructing liberal culture with a capital ‘C’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1463499612469584">Arnold (1993: 190)</xref> defined it: ‘a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world; and through this knowledge, turning a stream of fresh and free thought upon our stock notions and habits’. In sum, the imaginative pull freedom exerts on liberal persons might generate the compulsion to avoid freedom fundamentalism which, at the very same time, helps us to remain true to the liberal impulse for expanded frontiers.</p>
<p>But the liberal longing for broader cultural vistas must remain wary of unthinking excess. It can only do so by remaining reflexive, by knowing that the desire to transcend liberal culture is itself irreducibly grounded in that culture. Without this reflexive knowledge, the liberal person is doomed to endure the tragic dilettantism and self-undermining scepticism Hegel critiqued. Unfortunately, particularly among many of the most sensitive liberal souls, there is an un-reflexive tendency to look ‘outside’—to peasants and subalterns on the ‘periphery’; to the pre-modern past; even to the unconscious ‘Other’ of ourselves – for critical inspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1463499612469584">Žižek 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1463499612469584">Afary and Anderson 2005</xref>). Such ‘postmodern’ critics of liberal culture often lack reflexivity because of their hubris to perceive themselves as exceptional to the culture in which they are embedded, foregoing careful tracing of their origins and continued immersion in it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1463499612469584">Oakeshott 1962</xref>). As a consequence, their interpretation of other cultures is equally exaggerated, insisting on their radical otherness instead of, in Hegelian fashion, ‘thinking the unity that constitutes them’ (2008: 484). Commenting on the implications such ‘postmodern’ critiques have had on anthropology, Matti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1463499612469584">Bunzl (2008: 57)</xref> has observed:<disp-quote>
<p>Let me state the core problem as bluntly as I can: contemporary anthropology rejects culture as an essentialized abstraction that betrays the invariable traces of power/knowledge. But it does so to advance a fundamentally empirical claim, namely that what has been misinterpreted as homogenized culture is really a set of complex negotiations and contestations. Sociocultural anthropology may have rejected a scientistic variant of positivism, but it retains, even augments, a more immediate form, one that purports that all empirical phenomena are amenable to observation and description. What else, after all, is the demand to eschew false generalizations in the interest of more accurate representations of complexity? Under the current regime, this kind of positivism is absolutely rampant in sociocultural anthropology. Starting with a desire to challenge all essentialism and question all generalizations, the ethnographies of today are often simultaneous exercises in total deconstruction and absolute empirical specificity.</p></disp-quote>It might seem that the combination of extreme scepticism and hyper-empiricism is an odd pairing. Here, however, one should make a Hegelian move and see their identity: empiricism and scepticism are intrinsically linked in the philosophy of science, as for instance in the writings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1463499612469584">Hume (2008)</xref>. Arguably, hyper-empirical scepticism is the contradictory epistemology of liberal culture in its unhappy vein, a mixture of hard-nosed common-sense with unsatisfied yearning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1463499612469584">Osborne 2004: 22</xref>). Stated plainly, hyper-empiricism is a kind of active disavowal by the unhappy consciousness who believes all knowledge is power, constructed, and so forth, but is sentenced to the hard labour of fabricating it. It embodies the sceptical consciousness who, Hegel claims, ‘announces the nullity of seeing, hearing, and so on, yet <italic>itself</italic> sees and hears’ (Hegel, as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1463499612469584">Cherry and Robinson 1977</xref>: 227).</p>
<p>In this regard it is significant that Hegel invoked images of <italic>sublation</italic> instead of <italic>transcendence</italic>, implying that critique comes not from beyond but rather from below or within liberal culture. Like music, the philosophical ‘proof’ of sublation lies in the resonance the synthesis has with its subjects, by its affective power on its audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1463499612469584">Taylor 1989</xref>: 96).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1463499612469584">14</xref></sup> Such imagery implies an excavation of liberal culture aimed at tapping it deepest sources. Current efforts in anthropology and elsewhere that are rethinking the logical linkages between Christian theology and liberal culture seem to me to be engaged in precisely this type of effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1463499612469584">Cannell 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1463499612469584">Žižek 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1463499612469584">Connolly 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1463499612469584">Asad 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1463499612469584">Milbank 1990</xref>). This scholarship <italic>cumulatively</italic> points in the direction of a ‘third way’ between the sacred and the secular, in which sacred values are not rejected but rationalized into secular life as its spiritual underpinnings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1463499612469584">Figure 2</xref>). Hence Habermas has spoken of the need to resume the ‘unfinished dialectic of our own Western secularization process’ by ‘reflexive appropriation’ that can retrieve the ‘encrypted semantic potential’ of the underlying ‘religious content’ of liberal culture (Habermas, as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1463499612469584">Harrington 2007</xref>: 544).
<fig id="fig2-1463499612469584" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The dialectic of liberal culture.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1463499612469584-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Here there is a subtle but crucial distinction between freedom and liberty which the best liberal philosophers have appreciated. As Hayek noted, liberty is not about an individual doing whatever they want but a ‘relation of men to each other’ that leaves ‘room for the unforeseeable and unpredictable’ (1960: 12, 29). This shifts the basic terms of reference of our ideals from solitary selves to social relations; in other words, from the common critical concern with theorizing the conditions of possibility for the freedom of individuals toward elevating as our primary concern the ideal qualities of the relations between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1463499612469584">Bholat 2010</xref>). This also changes our normative quest as liberals from self-sufficiency to reflexive self-consciousness. Thus the distinction between freedom and liberty is not just a matter of splitting semantic hairs. Rather, wording is important because it gives different conceptual poles around which our sympathies, judgements, and actions rotate. Hence the reconstruction and restatement of our norms can transform the organization of social life previously premised on more confused terms.</p>
<p>By addressing themselves to such issues, anthropologists can become ‘universal individuals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1463499612469584">Hegel 2008</xref>: 195) who take cognizance of themselves as bearers of liberal culture and thus responsible for pressing it further. In the process, liberals are ennobled through the act of articulating what has hitherto been latent but not well stated. The ultimate goal of this kind of reflexivity is thus not freeing us from our ideals – to go on insisting they are merely ‘situated and partial’ <italic>ad infinitum</italic> – but to examine them more deeply in order to gain a stronger and sounder moral vocabulary to remedy cruelty and humiliation in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1463499612469584">Marcus and Fisher 1986</xref>). In so doing, reflexivity in anthropology can move beyond shallow self-critique (‘yes, this ethnography is a construction but …’) and the dark depths of unhappy consciousness.</p>

<fn id="fn8-1463499612469584"><label>8</label><p>Hegel’s analysis of cultural change is restricted to accounting for determinate negations of the dominant culture. For this reason, Hegel is blind to otherness (‘negativity’) that is not at all invested in that particular culture, an oversight for which Derrida takes Hegel to task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1463499612469584">Belmonte 2002</xref>).</p></fn>

<fn id="fn10-1463499612469584"><label>10</label><p>Note then that although Hegel contextualizes and critiques excessively subject-centred cultures, his own method pursues truth through the subject. In this regard, the formal adequacy of the method is reflexively justified as an expression of the culture Hegel is investigating – a culture of which he is obviously a part. But Hegel’s interest in subjectivity is to go beyond it, to state something about cultural substance. In this respect, Hegel follows ancient Greek and Christian thinkers in figuring subjectivity as issuing from and completing some objectivity – Eternal Ideas (Plato), Nature (Schelling), God (Eckhart), or Being (Heidegger). However, for Hegel, what is retrieved and refined is more contextually contingent, i.e. the <italic>zeitgeist</italic> of a particular culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1463499612469584">Taylor 1989</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn11-1463499612469584"><label>11</label><p>Nevertheless, the prospective unity of subject-object depends on the standpoint of the original critique. For Hegel, only those who have felt doubt deep down in their hearts, i.e. the path of unhappy consciousness, are capable of authoring a determinate critique that reworks a culture and its institutions into more rational ones.</p></fn>
