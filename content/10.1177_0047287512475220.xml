<abstract>
<p>This article examines the challenges that have emerged in tourism as a result of the new audit culture, and the effects this system is having on the creation of knowledge. A premium is now being placed on quantifying just about every type of output in our efforts to rank one agent or entity against another: people, programs, journals, disciplines, and so on. This analysis departs from other works on the topic through the use of philosophy, and in particular, the work of the Canadian philosopher John Ralston Saul. Saul’s thoughts on corporatism, instrumental reason, utilitarianism, and knowledge are fundamental to the situation we find ourselves in at present. I argue, as Saul does, for a return to content over structure and form. Although working within these systems may be beneficial to some scholars and their programs and universities, the practice is not helping to build a cohesive and well-organized field.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There has been a great deal of discussion recently in tourism studies, and in academe more generally, on the metrics of excellence in research. A premium is now being placed on quantifying just about every type of output in our efforts to measure or rank one agent or entity against another: people, programs, journals, disciplines, and so on. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512475220">Klocker and Drozdzewski (2012)</xref> have referred to this new system as the “neoliberal audit culture of contemporary Western universities” (p. 1271). These audit systems are said to be important because they provide greater ease and objectivity in how best to allocate scarce resources and assign merit. But while the system works for some, there is worry that we are moving away from a culture based on knowledge creation and critical thinking toward one based on meeting research standards above all else.</p>
<p>My first experience with this system came in 2010, when I asked a colleague of mine from overseas if she wanted to collaborate on what I thought was a new, thought-provoking piece on a facet of ecotourism that would be targeted in a B-level journal. Her response came through by email the following day—and it gutted me. She was not interested in the project because it did not fit with the expectations of her unit and university along the lines of productivity. By this, she meant that she would not waste her time publishing in a journal that could not reward her, her unit, or her university in a way that all would judge advantageous. The costs were seen to be higher than the benefits.</p>
<p>Through further probes, I discovered that for each single-authored article she publishes in A*-ranked journals she is given a large sum of money (in the thousands of dollars)—money she would presumably use to turn out more A* list publications. Her university gives her much less for publishing in B-level journals, especially if there is a coauthor involved. She also told me that she had decided to give up her role as an editor on a lower-ranked journal because that too was not a good use of her time. (See the flurry of emails on book reviews over TRINET, September 21, 2012. One Australian colleague stated, “I agree with the pressure on academics (and students) from their institutions is getting out of hand—so much so that many see little personal value in writing book reviews.”)</p>
<p>My first reaction to this situation was sadness, followed quickly by a state of utter confusion. I was sad for missing the opportunity to work with a valued colleague. But more than that, I just seemed sadder for her predicament. I found it hard to imagine that a system like hers could be such a formidable impediment to the creation of new knowledge. Too busy, too tired, too sick. These are all good reasons to excuse us from collaboration. Too wedded to a systems mentality? Not such a good excuse. I was confused because, as stated above, I do not work in such a system. I can publish wherever I choose, and my peers do not judge or try to influence these decisions in my home department, at my university, or within my country. My level of productivity is not a function of external, top–down pressure but rather a function of my own internal clockwork. If I have a less than stellar year because of new course preps, administrative duties, or other reasons, I know internally that I have to be more productive in years to follow. There are of course standards to which I am held. Yes, my ability to secure tenure and promotion was tied to my level of productivity. Yes, I must demonstrate competence in the areas of research, teaching, and service. But these requirements are clear, fair, attainable, and most importantly, unrestricted. I should also add that I am a big proponent of adhering to these requirements. Those who choose to publish less should teach more or be asked to engage in more service. And these folks should do this willingly.</p>
<p>I should also say that as an academic working in an environment that is not tightly connected to the audit culture, I have consciously tried to avoid submission of my articles in top journals, as counterproductive as this seems. I choose lower-ranked journals because I find the turnaround of an article to be quicker than our top journals. I also purposefully select these other journals because they are attempting to do their best in a climate of heavy competition. I happen to edit one of these journals. So perhaps there is a hint of bias. This bias surfaced recently when I withdrew an article from one of the A* journals because of that journal’s views on how a paper <italic>ought</italic> to be constructed. The screening method was, quite frankly, intolerable. The length of paragraphs, titles, abstracts, and the list goes on. No sense of individuality or authenticity for authors—just plain old rigid, Borg-like conformity.</p>
<p>But if we could stand back for a minute and take stock of where we are as a field, how should we measure success? Is tourism a strong and vibrant field? Is success tied only to publication in major journals? Are we happy and content as scholars working in our field? Some might argue that we are currently on the right track toward building competency in tourism, and this is represented in finally being able to properly recognize how merit ought to be implemented. Others might take the opposite tact in arguing that we are perhaps too preoccupied with a crisis of legitimacy running rampant at all levels of the university system. In the latter case, many have voiced concern that the university has sunk into a destructive ideology characterized by productivity, efficiency, insecurity, and fear, all of which hang over the heads of individuals and tourism programs not unlike the Sword of Damocles—an ever-present and very real impending doom that materializes if we fail to live up to the standards of an increasingly demanding system of excellence.</p>
<p>In this article, I wish to explore these themes through a brief foray into journal rankings and the neoliberal audit culture of contemporary Western universities in which many tourism faculty must work. This of course is not the first venture into this area. Other scholars have touched on aspects of this theme at least as far back as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287512475220">Van Doren, Holland, and Crompton (1984)</xref> in the context of leisure journals; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287512475220">Kent and Rutherford (1987)</xref> in hospitality; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287512475220">Sheldon (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512475220">1991</xref>) in tourism. The onset of national research evaluation programs, such as the United Kingdom’s Research Assessment Exercise, generated a flurry of new inquiries on the part of tourism researchers from the mid-2000s right up to the present day. Examples of these include how the RAE was to provide for greater accountability and transparency in tourism research for merit and funding purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287512475220">Page 2003</xref>); the development of a ranking scale for journals according to readership, scientific relevance, and other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287512475220">Pechlaner et al. 2004</xref>); the evaluation of research performance according to program heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287512475220">Law and Chon 2007</xref>); challenges to ranking journals in tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287512475220">Jamal, Smith, and Watson 2008</xref>); how the ranking of journals provides benefits to the tourism academic community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287512475220">McKercher 2005</xref>); and more specific contributions on citations analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287512475220">McKercher 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287512475220">Chang and McAleer 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While the vast majority of these works focus more squarely on the audit system itself, this paper is more in the spirit of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287512475220">Ryan (2005)</xref>, but particularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287512475220">Page (2005)</xref> who, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512475220">Klocker and Drozdzewski (2012)</xref> above, takes issue with the onset of a managerial culture created by ranking exercises, and the effects this has had on the creation of knowledge. The point of departure here surrounds the incorporation of philosophy, and in particular, the work of the celebrated Canadian philosopher John Ralston Saul. Although Saul is not a tourism theorist, his thoughts on corporatism, instrumental reason, utilitarianism, and knowledge are fundamental to the situation we find ourselves in at present.</p>

<sec id="section2-0047287512475220">
<title>Measuring Excellence in Tourism Research</title>
<p>Key metrics used in assessing excellence in tourism research include the frequency of publication, that is, how many papers we publish and, increasingly, the outlet of publication. In reference to the latter, the issue under consideration here is that all journals are not created equal. Where we publish is perhaps more important than what we publish.</p>
<p>In 2010, The Australian Business Deans Council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512475220">ABDC 2010</xref>) ranked 79 tourism and hospitality journals into one of four categories. Three journals (<italic>Annals of Tourism Research, Journal of Travel Research</italic>, and <italic>Tourism Management</italic>) were given an A* ranking; 12 were given an A ranking; 25, a B ranking; and 39, a C ranking. It is generally accepted that the three journals at the A* standing are the field’s strongest journals (the “Big 3”). For those tied to the neoliberal audit culture, a publication in one of the top journals satisfies several managerial criteria. A scholar’s work gets in a top journal; the work has the potential to be more widely read based on journal circulation and reputation; other academics are more likely to cite the work; the scholar receives money for publishing in a top outlet; one’s academic departmental unit gets benefits in the form of higher status relative to the department’s competitors (other tourism units); and so does the university.</p>
<p>For those scholars who manage to publish at a torrid rate, and who can craft sufficient quality according to the standards of the top journals, the system is no doubt a good one. For other less successful scholars struggling to publish in the top tier, the process can sometimes be demoralizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287512475220">Page 2005</xref>) and can extend into a two- or even three-part procedure. First, in order to satisfy the demands of the system we need to submit (to show intent to our superiors) our papers to the top journals. But these journals have massive rejection rates (by necessity and to keep their top standing), and so there is a good chance of rejection. After rejection, scholars will typically submit their work to an A or B class journal. God forbid, if we need to submit further down the chain, but a publication is, after all, a publication in the end—just not a very good one according to the system. And because the review process often takes a great deal of time, it places in jeopardy the timeliness of results if the author must endure successive rounds of review in these other outlets. Top journals often have delays of up to two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512475220">Adler and Harzing 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>What the foregoing suggests is that the medium of distribution is oftentimes more important than the message. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512475220">Christenson and Sigelman (1985)</xref> refer to this as the accreditation of knowledge. Journals provide a type of accreditation or stamp of approval, with some refereed journals offering more accreditation than others because of their higher status. The value of the publication is therefore measured not necessarily in the paper itself, but rather on where it occurs (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512475220">MacDonald and Kam 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287512475220">2009</xref>). In this capacity, tourism’s “Big 3” are laughing all the way to the bank. Business has never been better.</p>
<p>Furthermore, how the top journals gain their lofty status is of particular interest here. For the Big 3 we should not discount the labor of many experienced editors, referees, and of course authors who must be held to very high standards. If the system works, the labor placed into the final product by all involved will produce an excellent paper that has potential to be well cited in the future. The citation index, which is a metric of how frequently a journal article is cited in other journals (or the same journal) over a given period of time, becomes an important measure of a journal’s quality and success. However, even though the citation index acts as a good objective and quantifiable measure of an article’s performance, there are certain inherent biases tied to this metric. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512475220">McKercher, Law, and Lam (2006)</xref> argue that</p>
<list id="list1-0047287512475220" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>there is a strong bias toward English-language journals,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>there is an inability to discriminate between positive and negative remarks on the paper,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>citation systems favor older, more established journals that publish generalist themes over the newer more specialized journals,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>older, more established scholars who are well known have an advantage over younger, less well known scholars.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Impact factors (IFs) are also important. The IF is “a simple ratio of citations and papers. They are calculated by dividing the number of current-year citations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287512475220">1997</xref>) to a journal’s papers published in the previous two years . . . by the combined total of these papers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287512475220">Garfield 1997</xref>, p. 11). In 2012, <italic>Annals of Tourism Research</italic> had an impact factor (IF) of 3.259, followed by <italic>Tourism Management</italic> with an IF of 2.597, and <italic>Journal of Travel Research</italic>, with an IF of 1.579.</p>
<p>Given the importance of the IF to the success of a journal, scholars have investigated coercive practices among journal editors in the social sciences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287512475220">Wilhite and Fong (2012)</xref> report on the responses of 6,672 academics from economics, business, psychology, and sociology along with 832 journals from these disciplines. The authors discovered that editors frequently influence authors to add more citations of their journal. More specifically, (1) it is usually junior scholars who are less likely to resist an editor’s wishes; (2) editors are found to be more coercive if they know other editors in their field are adopting these practices; (3) business journal editors were found to be more coercive than editors of journals in the other disciplines; and (4) highly ranked journals are more likely to coerce for the purpose of keeping their top positions. Even though the business discipline was found to be more coercive, all disciplines included in the study had multiple instances of coercion (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512475220">Hall 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287512475220">Luce, McGill, and Peracchio 2012</xref>). There appears to be no empirical evidence on the practices among tourism journal editors, which might make for an interesting topic of investigation down the road.</p>
<p>A logical extension of the ranking of journals is the ranking of tourism programs. We can now assess who is publishing in which journals, or more properly we can sum the publication efforts of all faculty in an academic unit, especially those works in the top journals, and compare this output to other tourism units in order to assess and make claims of academic excellence. This is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512475220">Severt et al. (2009)</xref> have done, building off work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287512475220">Jogaratnam et al. (2005)</xref>. Severt and his colleagues analyzed scholarly contributions in 11 top tourism and hospitality journals for the years 2002 to 2006 according to sums of instances, authors, and articles in ranking the top 100 programs in the world. I am not sure how many tourism programs exist in the world, but my university, Brock, sits at number 96. This places us near the bottom of the top 100. In many tourism circles this is a point, I suspect, one would not willingly offer up. But this ranking is hardly surprising given the freedom that Brock tourism scholars have to publish wherever they want.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this system of ranking corresponds to the evolution of national and institutional programs found throughout the world. The United Kingdom has the Research Evaluation Exercise, which has evolved into the Research Excellence Framework; Australia has the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287512475220">Australian Research Council 2009</xref>); New Zealand has the Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF); and South Africa has the Researcher Rating System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287512475220">Coles 2009</xref>). All of these are designed to assign merit and demonstrate competency among faculty—gaining tenure and promotion—or even to keep a job.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512475220">Hall (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287512475220">Ryan (2005)</xref> point out, that these institutions are charged with the responsibility of establishing the “rules of the game.” However, the rules are not the same between systems, and even within jurisdictions there are different rules that serve different purposes. For example, the Australian Business Deans Council, mentioned above, developed its own set of journal rankings, which are different from those developed by Australia’s ARC. Even when two expert panels rank journals using the same criteria, there is significant divergence. The same divergence takes place at the regional level, as exemplified in the difference between how business deans in the United Kingdom and Australia rank journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512475220">Hall 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0047287512475220">
<title>Poor Queen Mary</title>
<p>While the idea behind these standards and audits may appear to be sound in theory, in practice there are far-reaching implications for those trying to keep pace. Queen Mary University of London is such a place, which is said to have it all wrong in reference to the criteria used in rewarding and firing faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287512475220">Colquhoun 2012</xref>). It is a useful example to use here because Queen Mary is not unlike other programs in the audit system, which places a premium on quantity as the first priority. In order to survive at Queen Mary, faculty must have published 11 papers between the years 2008 and 2011, with at least 2 of these in high-quality journals (high-impact journals). For a lecturer, keeping one’s job means publishing five papers, with one of these appearing in a high-quality journal. Queen Mary sets these standards for the purpose of maintaining its place among the top 150 universities in the world (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qmul.ac.uk/">http://www.qmul.ac.uk/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Productivity rules the day, Colquhoun observes, which has catalyzed a climate of dishonesty. Those scholars publishing papers every few weeks are likely not writing them, but rather adding their names to work they have probably not even read. In efforts to keep their heads above water, and to keep their jobs, scholars by necessity have had to form collaborative research networks to attain the very high productivity standards demanded by the system. This is part of the gamesmanship required in getting one’s name in a top journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512475220">Macdonald and Kam 2007</xref>), where authors place more time and effort into manipulating and courting editors than in the work itself (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512475220">Lawrence 2003</xref>). For those wishing to have babies, the system is even less forgiving, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512475220">Klocker and Drozdzewski (2012)</xref>. The audit culture does not allow women to remain as competitive in such a system because they are unable to produce as many “quantifiable outputs” as those not having babies.</p>
<p>The problem, and this is an important point as it relates to tourism scholarship and our Big 3, is that many of the highest-quality journals like <italic>Science</italic> get the vast majority of their citations from a relatively small number of articles. Basing decisions on what is high-quality research and what is not on such a skewed distribution of citations is senseless. Colquhoun further questions the wisdom of the system when he reports that the three Nobel Prize winners that he has known well would have been fired under the conditions established by Queen Mary. Quantity has surpassed quality in the new university structure.</p>
<p>Bridging from the example of Noble Laureates, above, how should we stack all of one’s publications, or all of a unit’s publications, up against one truly outstanding contribution; one worthy of a Nobel prize in tourism? Do we have one? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512475220">Butler’s (1980)</xref> paper on the tourist area life cycle is said to be the most oft-quoted article in the field. It is a brilliant paper and very helpful to students and faculty alike in theorizing tourism in the context of human and environmental dynamics. However, you will not find Butler’s paper in one of our field’s top journals. It is not even in a journal dedicated solely to tourism. Furthermore, although enormously influential within the rather insular walls of tourism, how monumental is this paper beyond our realm?</p>
<p>I searched Google Scholar and found that Butler’s paper had been cited 2,414 times. I analyzed 600 of these citations randomly (25%) and found that only 8 of these 600 citations (1.3%) did not have the word <italic>tourism</italic> in the title of the article or in the title of the journal or book (I included all topics related to tourism, like “beach” and “casino”). Upon closer scrutiny, these eight citations were written on topics with links to tourism, such as urban planning, resource management, economics and globalization, and in all cases tourism was mentioned somewhere in the body of the document. Tourism, in whatever measure, was a focus of all 600 publications. The point is that while our most frequently cited work is certainly leading inside the field, its range of influence is minimal outside the field. And I would argue that this is a point we need to recognize and come to grips with as a field. Of the thousands of papers in our journals, I would estimate that a very small percentage of these have relevance to scholars and disciplines outside our walls.</p>
<p>Lets pretend that tourism is as important as evolutionary biology, chemistry, economics, or psychology. How about physics? My father-in-law is a theoretical physicist who specialized in chaos theory when he was active. When I asked him if he wanted to collaborate on something together (at the time when chaos theory was “important” in tourism), he just snickered. I could only imagine he was thinking about what Ernest Rutherford said in reference to physics in comparison to other disciplines: “All science is either physics or stamp collecting.” I knew enough not to pursue the angle any further.</p>
<p>Taken a step further, I wonder if there are disciplinary rankings. Tourism should be rather low on these rankings. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512475220">Hall (2011)</xref> illustrates that in the 2008 RAE, tourism and hospitality was found to be the “worst performing sector” as determined by the business and management subpanel in reference to journal research quality. None of our journals were assessed in the top tier of the ranking. What’s more troubling than being the worst performing sector is that we should be made to feel inferior by a discipline that many in tourism have little conceptual or theoretical connection to.</p>
<p>Sadly, I do not know that tourism will ever be able to win the respect of other disciplines unless we have more to offer, unless we can develop theory that explains human nature in a way that evolutionary biology or psychology has not. If one of us does, and I hope we do, it might very well be that we would choose another outlet besides our “top” journals as a publication medium. Given recent predilections, we would likely go online and choose the journal that has the highest impact value. On second thought, we probably would not if this journal is not factored into our departmental metrics.</p>
<p>A recent commentary by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287512475220">MacCannell (2012)</xref> is useful in emphasizing part of the problem we are wrestling with in tourism. MacCannell argues that as we enter the fourth decade of tourism scholarship, there is the awareness that the field has become amorphous. This is a helpful observation. The unfortunate and unsettling part of this (MacCannell’s main concern is the lack of activity in the area of tourism and ethics) is that he really does convincingly prove his point. MacCannell writes:<disp-quote>
<p>With all the overlap between tourism and the philosophical domain of ethics, and the willingness of tourism researchers to concede this overlap in a series of rhetorical flourishes in their writing, there has been little serious engagement of ethics, as such, by tourism researchers</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There are now dozens of articles on ethics that grace the pages of various tourism journals, not to mention larger stand-alone monographs on the topic (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512475220">Smith and Duffy 2003</xref>). It is difficult to understand how MacCannell missed these serious engagements of ethics, and just as difficult to understand how the referees of his commentary missed the mark too?</p>
<p>MacCannell further argues that “a research domain without ethical reflexivity, that refuses to come to grips with itself and its subject matter in ethical terms, is doomed to failure” (p. 185). Truer words were never written. MacCannell’s most recent magnum opus, <italic>The Ethics of Sightseeing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512475220">2011</xref>), will no doubt provide the foundation to propel the tourism field into a new era of important research. But at the same time, a research domain that refuses to organize itself in a way that allows researchers to build on past work because of this formlessness, might also be doomed to failure (see my point above in reference to Smith and Duffy). If there is no dedicated space for tourism and ethics, not that such is warranted at the present time, these papers must continue to exist in some disjointed (amorphous) way. They exist <italic>sans domicile</italic>.</p>
<p>In getting back on track with the discussion on journal superiority and inferiority complexes, and in light of MacCannell’s point on the field’s disjointedness, there is a ripple effect if papers are submitted not according to theme but rather on the basis of journal quality. This means that a quality paper on heritage is submitted and accepted in a journal that, although read much more broadly, does not necessarily fit thematically. I tend to favor the thoughts of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287512475220">Segalla (2008)</xref> along these lines, who wrote that academic papers would be “better appreciated, published more quickly, and perhaps have more impact if they were published in specialised journals” (p. 126). The only way to emphasize (or perhaps overemphasize) this point is to look outside our field.</p>
<p>The Directory of Open Access Journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287512475220">DOAJ 2012</xref>) has Biology and Life Sciences as one of its main subject categories, with “Biology” and “Life Sciences” further subdivided into their main constituent parts. To use Biology as an example, this arm contains 257 journals. These are further subdivided into seven classes, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512475220">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The journal <italic>Acta Herpetologica</italic> would not likely entertain papers on insects. These papers would more appropriately be submitted to the <italic>Journal of Insect Science</italic>. Nor would it accept papers on gorillas in Africa. These papers would instead be submitted to the journal <italic>African Primates</italic>. Pulling the argument into tourism, why would I go to a top tourism journal that has a broadly based mandate for, say, an article on the impacts that venomous snakes have on visitation at heritage sites, when the <italic>Journal of Heritage Tourism</italic> would be a more appropriate outlet? Authors have made decisions not on the basis of theme but rather on prestige (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287512475220">Franceschet 2010</xref> in reference to the difference between popularity and prestige in journals). While this practice may help the individual and her program and university, I am not sure it is helping to build a cohesive and well-organized field.</p>

<title>Adding Content to Structure and Form</title>
<p>The previous section dealt with issues surrounding the shift in emphasis from knowledge creation and critical thinking (content), to the satisfaction of standards and audits (structure and form). I wish to step laterally in attempting to provide scope into how we have found our way to where we are. I enlist the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512475220">John Ralston Saul (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512475220">2001</xref>), whose books have been enormously influential in demonstrating how we have moved away from individualism toward a corporatist ideology both in society in general and the university more specifically.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Unconscious Civilization</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512475220">1995</xref>), Saul’s main thesis is the notion that globally we are being held hostage by the ideology of corporatism. What is representative of normal behavior corresponds to the values championed by the corporation: efficiency, productivity, and form—a life premised on organizational structure, self-interest, and meritocracy. We willingly subscribe to these systems because they are thought to be easy, safe, certain, and comfortable. The problem with this approach is that we do not really know who “we” are because ideology tends to narrow and flatten our options from the built-in certainty that what we are <italic>all</italic> doing together is the only way forward. In the end, there is a diminished capacity for expressions of the self—of true individualism—which further leads to passivity and conformity.</p>
<p>This is what Kierkegaard was after when he described the leveling down of society. In <italic>The Present Age</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512475220">Kierkegaard (1962)</xref> argued that a focus on form over content has a way of suppressing exceptionalism and individualism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512475220">Caputo 2007</xref>). Interpreted, if we continue to bend to a system that concerns itself primarily with quantity, there is the possibility that we must act outside of who we really are. We have stepped on that moving sidewalk along with everyone else and lost the capacity for authentic action. We have become passive and conformist. I am not sure this approach is consistent with who and what we ought to be as independent thinkers in an institution that ought to preserve independent thought. This is being lost as we allow dominant forces to dictate what passes as “normal” behavior.</p>
<p>Self-interest is an integral part of the corporatist ideology. But even though we need self-interest in order to secure our own well-being personally and in business, it often has the counterproductive effect of actually slowing us down because of a focus on accumulation and the short term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512475220">Saul 2001</xref>). A system that is built on the shaky stilts of self-interest is one that apparently knows how to recognize quality and, once recognized, feed the “best” up the vertical chain to the top. For this reason, self-interest and business cannot take the lead in society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512475220">Saul (2001)</xref> adds, “Society must lead them” (p. 107). If we are to look seriously at our current trajectory in tourism research, we must acknowledge that a focus on corporatism, driven by self-interest and Darwinian survival of the fittest, has us convinced that this is the way to go.</p>
<sec id="section5-0047287512475220">
<title>Instrumental Reason and the University</title>
<p>The problem with a university bent on corporatism, meritocracy, and self-interest is that it places reason—instrumental reason or jumped-up utilitarianism from Saul’s perspective—above all other human qualities. In <italic>On Equilibrium</italic> (2001), Saul argues that we are wedded to a type of rationalism that says that we can organize ourselves according to systems that seem to have created more problems than they solve. When we reason in the absence of ethics, memory, common sense, intuition, and imagination, we run into problems. For example, reason without ethics leads us to ideology’s doorstep. There are no other qualities summoned to temper reason’s unidimensionality. It is the same with common sense. By failing to incorporate common sense into decision making, we give up the ability to think laterally and in a more complex manner. Following from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287512475220">Charles Taylor (1992)</xref>, Saul argues that reason turns into mechanics: “Because it pretends to deliver rational solutions, it claims primacy of place. Because it claims efficiency and calculable success, it can marginalize not only other views of reason, but any other human quality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512475220">Saul 2001</xref>, p. 305). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287512475220">Heidegger (1966)</xref> referred to this as society’s predisposition toward calculative thinking, or the need to favor efficiency, logic, linear processing, and productivity, over the less functional (but more difficult) meditative thinking, or the ability to see beyond cost–benefit calculations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512475220">Fennell and Malloy 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This same type of reasoning is also responsible for turning the university environment away from a place of liberal arts education to one of vocational training. Students forced into overly prescribed curricula are trained to do increasingly narrow tasks as part of the system that can only recognize success or achievement in one way. Parents question deans and department heads about job placement statistics and other metrics with the expectation that costs (tuition) will guarantee benefits (the right job). And faculty function according to the same system premised on the value of outputs, above all else (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512475220">Lightfoot 2012</xref> in reference to poor teaching grades at some of the United Kingdom’s best universities). Not unlike self-interest, above, we are being led by structure and form rather than by content—a shifting emphasis from critical thinking and knowledge, to recognition and Pavlovian reward.</p>
<p>The utilitarian nature of this shift is represented in the business schools, Saul adds, which operate entirely upon this corporatist mentality—they offer only one main epistemological position: profit. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512475220">Saul [1995]</xref> argues that business schools would be much better placed if they resided outside the university and were funded and operated by industry in some type of apprenticeship model; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287512475220">Bennis and O’Toole 2005</xref>.) The problem is the university has followed this lead. Because universities need money, they open themselves up to an approach where everything is for sale. Sponsorship from large corporations makes the university predictable and linear, because anytime the university wanders away of the corporatist objective the money can disappear. Nike made the money disappear from universities that were critical of its practices in lesser-developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512475220">Saul 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>We favor instrumental reason when we subscribe to systems at places like Queen Mary of London, that ask faculty members to publish 11 papers over a period of three years and where productivity rules over all else. We have become desperate to order and number the world as the only way to justify our existence. For Saul, this obsession with the quantitative is symptomatic of an obsession with stability. This obsession “suggests a terror, not of instability, but of uncertainty and the unknown” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512475220">Saul 2001</xref>, p. 220).</p>
<p>We also favor instrumental reason when tourism journals act as gatekeepers of knowledge and advancement. In this capacity, there is the belief that knowledge, or rather the right type of knowledge, is becoming proprietary. As observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287512475220">Macdonald and Kam (2009</xref>, p. 223): “Editors talk about <italic>who</italic> they publish; authors about <italic>where</italic> they publish: neither is much concerned about <italic>what</italic> they publish.” If we are able to control knowledge, Saul argues, we are in a position to gain power and to advance. Although he is talking in reference to individuals, the point is equally relevant to institutions:<disp-quote>
<p>Knowledge is owned and controlled, bought and sold, in a corporatist society—knowledge which matters, that is. The people who have it do have power as we understand power today, given our managerial, technocratic elite. Knowledge is one of the currencies of systems men, just as it was for the courtiers in the halls of Versailles. They require a position in the structure that provides them with some ability to deny access to others and to gain access for themselves. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512475220">Saul 1995</xref>, p. 44)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While I am certain that their methods are pure and objective, there is no escaping the fact that the Big 3 have a significant influence over who advances through the ranks and who does not. Nevertheless, there is something distasteful, something elitist, about having to pay the piper in order to gain entry into the right club. And it is even more distasteful when it is knowledge that is reduced to currency.</p>
<p>Tracing back to the section on the comparative impact of tourism research versus the other social sciences, all this comes into sharp focus in light of Saul’s views on the social sciences in general—what he views as the false sciences. For Saul, the “impression of knowledge leads to passivity in the social scientist. They claim to produce truths, but these are too fragile to produce anything other than passivity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512475220">Saul 1995</xref>, p. 72). We keep searching for truth and legitimacy in social science simply because of the weight, not substance, of what he calls circumstantial evidence. If what Saul argues is right, even partly right, how is it that one journal can claim priority over others in view of the big picture, especially if tourism is less significant in comparison to other social sciences, and social science less significant to the natural and pure sciences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287512475220">Pinker 2002</xref>, who describes social psychology as a mishmash of phenomena often unexplained by theory)?</p>
<p>Maybe there is a grain of truth to what Saul is saying. I have heard colleagues lament over the fact that we keep turning out work that sometimes feels inconsequential. I know I do. (Three papers that I personally believe are my most meaningful contribution to the field have, collectively, generated 20 citations, according to Google Scholar.) In the end, it is hard to tell whether our efforts are consequential or inconsequential because there is this hollow feeling that one’s work has slipped with apparent ease into obscurity under the weight and disjointedness of “what’s out there.” Fragments of knowledge suspended in space and time. And all this even though we have so much information at the touch of a few buttons. Maybe it is simply that there is too much information? Maybe it is simply that “the more we know, the more confused we seem to feel . . . a multiplicity of certainties which do not add up to a shape or a context” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512475220">Saul 2001</xref>, p. 216)? Perhaps this is why there appears to be such a high frequency of self-promotion over TRINET?</p>

<title>Where the Bloody Hell Are We?</title>
<p>What is troubling about the situation at Queen Mary University of London and other institutions caught in the same predicament is that we are messing with academic freedom. In his qualitative analysis of the state of affairs in tourism research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512475220">Tribe (2010)</xref> writes that some respondents commented that they felt free as tourism researchers, while other scholars complained that promotion was hinged on satisfying the publication requests of superiors. Although not explicit in Tribe’s work, it might very well be that the two cases above represent both poles of the topic under consideration here. One tied to the audit culture, and the other not. One respondent shared concern over the necessity of having to work within the system:<disp-quote>
<p>If you know that somebody’s going to be looking at the quality of the journal that you’re publishing in, you have to put a couple of articles in one of those journals. But once you have done that . . . then it’s much more fun to publish in a place where there is innovation, good ideas, things happen. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512475220">Tribe 2010</xref>, p. 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another respondent stated:<disp-quote>
<p>Yet the fact remains that not all that claims to be tourism research finds acceptability within these journals [<italic>ATR</italic> and <italic>JTR</italic>]. . . . It means the defined limits of what can and what cannot be published in these journals constitute the regimes of truth through which tourism research is directly or indirectly governed. You either operate within these defined discourses and be in with a chance of getting published or perish. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512475220">Tribe 2010</xref>, p. 28)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Still another claimed that two of the top journals<disp-quote>
<p>had a very traditional academic board who were looking at things in a particular way . . . if you’ve got something that challenges the norm, then it’s unlikely to get through the process. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512475220">Tribe 2010</xref>, p. 28)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The notion of top journals as gatekeepers is evident here—almost a rite of passage before the fun stuff really starts. What’s also troubling is that knowledge must be managed or “governed” by a system that, increasingly, narrows and flattens our options. This is the conformity and linear instrumental reason discussed above, wrought by a system too heavily guided by corporatist thinking.</p>
<p>But as long as we are acting professionally, we should be free to write and speak in public and disseminate our works in places that <italic>we</italic> as individuals deem important, not someone else. Of course we can, but there is the full weight of institutional pressure hanging over our heads. The problem here is that we cannot really take care of ourselves without also having to take care of the interests of other dominant entities; the feeling that we have to serve someone even though their goals are not necessarily ours. What is further distasteful is that we are being swept away in a managerial system that pits one against the other—and I mean one journal against the other, one program against the other, and one scholar against the other—under a childlike certainty that what we are doing is right. We are being herded. Make no mistake about it. Both Kierkegaard and Heidegger felt the same about this “crowd,” “herd,” or “public” mentality, which is characterized by a surveillance system compelled to monitor everything we do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512475220">Caputo 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The leisure scholars among us, and as tourism researchers we should all have some knowledge in this area, would argue that the system seems to promote actions that are more the realm of extrinsic motivation than intrinsic. The former is that less-than-pure type of motivation that stimulates participation on the basis of external influences: power, popularity, trophies, money, and so on. By contrast, intrinsic motivation is characterized by participation for its own sake. Competition is a form of extrinsic motivation because it directs us to measure ourselves against someone or something else. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>I wish to offer one other way to position my thoughts on intrinsic/extrinsic motivation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287512475220">Victor Frankl (1985)</xref> argued that we are in a constant search for meaning in our lives. If it is the pursuit of happiness we are after, we will constantly miss the mark because we have made it a central driving force in our lives. The harder we try, the more we are bound to fail because we are acting first and foremost in the service of self-interest. Instead, happiness ensues—it is a by-product, which is elusive if made the principal objective in life. When the pursuit of standards, audits, and administrative objectives (extrinsic) becomes more important than the pursuit of knowledge for the sake of knowledge (intrinsic) in our attempts to gain admiration and respect, we are walking the wrong path. We cannot demand respect in the same way that we cannot plan on being happy. Respect ensues if we happen to publish good ideas, no matter where these ideas end up. And refusing to cite these good ideas simply because they are located in “inferior” journals is a decision that will not move us forward.</p>
<p>If I were asked what the measure of success is in tourism, that is, what is truly meaningful, where a paper (or a book for that matter) is published should never enter the discussion. There are too many wild cards at hand that permit or deny entry in a given journal in space and time. For me it will always be the use of external theory or philosophy in advancing the way we think about tourism. We need more of this if we are to earn respect from outside our narrow walls. But if we are so preoccupied with quantity (remember poor Queen Mary), our chances at immortality (remember the Nobel Prize) escape our grasp like the fine white sands of Cayo Coco passing through our hands. Good papers, like good wine, require good time. Unhappily, many scholars no longer have the time as they struggle to gain respect, earn more money, or to save their jobs. Visualized as such, it is almost as though the audit system in place—the one that rewards the ‘haves’ and penalizes the ‘have-nots’—is characterized instead by diminishing returns.</p>
<p>I would also place value in collegiality, which I was sadly denied in the case of my friend from overseas, mentioned at the outset. It used to be that scholars walked and talked together, shared ideas, and supported one another in the quest for quality. This was the spirit of what it meant to be collegial—helping each other in the pursuit of a common goal: knowledge. As scholars, journals, and institutions retreat further into their own Darwinian worlds in the pursuit of academic excellence, there is the sense that we really have lost our way.</p>
