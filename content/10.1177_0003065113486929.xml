<body>
<p>Christopher Bollas’s <italic>China on the Mind</italic> caught my eye because I have an interest in the application of analytic therapies in mainland China and, with much less experience, Taiwan. I have been teaching object relations psychoanalysis in China since 2007 and, most recently, psychoanalytic couple therapy in Beijing to students from all over China. I have become interested in the problem of how our Chinese colleagues experience psychoanalytic ideas, and especially how they put them into practice. There are practical issues involving the prior lack of training, the fact that psychotherapy and psychoanalysis are foreign imports with no history in China before 1929, eradication of what little had begun between 1949 and 1976, and new importation beginning in the 1980s. Moreover, the Chinese Communist Party had launched an all-out war on everything Western from 1949 on, while also eradicating, with seeming success, the philosophical underpinnings of traditional Chinese culture. Because Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism all but disappeared from sight in those years, it was assumed by many that their contribution to the structure of Chinese morality and psychological structure had also disappeared.</p>
<p>However, many of us have found that this appearance is deceptive. Mao was not so different from many Chinese emperors of the last twenty-five hundred years. He was both more successful and more destructive than many, and he did transform many Confucian deep assumptions, but fundamentally he built on them to fashion the well-known cult of his personality that bound the Chinese people of the Communist era to him. He used Confucian morality, which begins with loyalty to the emperor, to his advantage, and he elevated the idea of loyalty to the group to the next highest principle. Loyalty to the party expressed as fidelity to the “people” came now before loyalty to the family and the father, but the criterion of correct thought was fealty to Mao and his ideas of the moment. It was distorted Confucianism, but Confucian nonetheless.</p>
<p>Christopher Bollas’s encounter with China, Japan, and Korea is with the mind and mentality of the East,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003065113486929">2</xref></sup> and though his actual travels in Asia seem to have been more in Japan than in China, his reading and discussion about the Eastern mind is principally about Chinese thinkers, sometimes as interpreted by Korean or Japanese writers. He has read broadly and deeply. In this book he is concerned to find both differences and overlap in psychoanalysis and Eastern thought. Before reading his little book—really a long essay—I had asked a number of Chinese psychotherapist and psychoanalyst colleagues to write about the ideas underpinning Chinese thought, especially how these might support or undermine the introduction of psychoanalysis to China, for a book I am editing with Sverre Varvin. Their essays have gone a long way to educate me, and I hope they will educate others. So I was skeptical that Bollas, who seems not to have had any clinical experience in China, Korea, or Japan, could usefully teach us about the encounter between psychoanalysis and Chinese mentality.</p>
<p>Luckily, I was wrong. Bollas’s essay is of a different kind and at a different level, and should be useful both to those who would be thoughtful about the introduction of psychoanalysis into China and to those who wonder, as I do, about the impact the Chinese experience will have on psychoanalysis itself. Bollas’s thesis is that psychoanalysis has from the beginning been profoundly imbued with concerns found in Chinese thinking, but that they have been culturally repressed. The book juxtaposes his view of psychoanalysis with a deep reading of Eastern ideas —most centrally those of the seminal Chinese thinkers Confucius, Lao Tzu, Zhuangzi, and Mencius—and with Buddhist texts and later interpreters and poets, including modern poets. In counterpoint, he writes extensively about his own concerns and ways of conceptualizing psychoanalysis. It is necessary to give a brief overview of his thinking for the reader of this review to understand the focus of his theme and variations on Chinese thought.</p>
<p>Bollas sees two streams of development in psychoanalysis: the maternal order of mind and the paternal. He thinks that Freud and his followers developed the paternal order, the order of the word, of verbal meaning and oedipal organization. The paternal order is in the main the thought of linear and verbal meaning, of interpretation, of the father’s interruption of the maternal order. Only later did Winnicott and Masud Khan introduce the maternal order, the world of early, preverbal development, of being instead of paternal doing, of affectively dominated implicit knowing rather than paternal explicit knowing, a world of ambiguity and emotional experience as a way of being rather than a world of striving to achieve and of verbal meaning.</p>
<p>However, Bollas also believes that Freud took as an unexpressed and unthought given that the earlier realm of maternal experience was there. The world of experience Freud described was built on that. Bollas writes that this earlier foundation of the maternal order came, unacknowledged, from the East. In a similar and complementary way, the world of verbal exposition is implicit in Eastern thinking. Joining what is unsaid in each body of thinking can provide a meeting place. Confucius, and especially the great thinkers of Buddhism and Daoism, Bollas says, were thinking in the maternal order, the preverbal substructure of the true self. They dealt with ways of being in the world rather than the Freudian mode of doing in the world. Daoism and Zen Buddhism deal with being part of nature and the universe, finding meaning in the surrender of self and living with the transience of all experience, while the West believes in doing and overcoming. Freudian analysis deals with an active view of the self, with self-autonomy and self-actualization through an analytic striving. Bollas links these differences to similar contrasts in ancient Eastern and Western texts. The great epics of the West, beginning with <italic>Gilgamesh</italic> and running through Homer to Shakespeare, are stories of heroes who struggle against the odds to overcome adversity. The self suffers but is triumphant and emergent. The great Eastern writings are about transcendence, impermanence, and surrender to nature through dissolution of the self. The self is embedded. It surrenders and does not dominate the social or natural world.</p>
<p>Winnicott and Khan, says Bollas, described a different psychoanalysis, the world of being, of noninterpretive psychoanalytic experience most present in enigma, metaphor, and silence, where an analysand can find a true self before and beyond words. This is the world of Bollas’s maternal order, more present in Eastern thought, where mindlessness itself is meaning-making.</p>
<p>There are other discoveries in Bollas’s essay. Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist teachings, he notes, are full of prescriptions and aphorisms, wisdom that teaches us how to live. They are essentially prescriptive about how to live a life that is socially and morally embedded in society. They cultivate an upright, socially adapted false self, but they are not psychologically minded. They do not investigate the conflicted mind; they do not probe the mind shaped by deprivation; they do not explore trauma and its sequelae. They offer principles for a life led in accordance with a moral order. In the case of Confucius and Mencius (Confucius’s most important intellectual descendent), it is the life of order in a society shaped by a hierarchy of loyalties—to the emperor, the father, the family, the older brother, one’s friends, and, in reciprocity, the emperor to his subjects, the father to his son. Daoism, which pervades Chinese thought in creative tension with Confucian morality, preaches becoming one with nature in surrender to the order of things. There is passivity in the surrender here that runs counter to the active striving of the student of Confucius and Mencius. This tension is tempered by Buddhism, especially Zen, which is prominently a feature of Japanese mentality but not of Chinese. Zen promotes the annihilation of self, surrender to a greater order in a way that far transcends the Daoist philosophy of being in nature, but both share an attitude about the self that Bollas sees as radically counter to the Western idea of the self that strives to become, focused on doing and active meaning rather than surrender.</p>
<p>One of Bollas’s surprising theses is that Freud, in making the unconscious assumption of a maternal order, actually founded psychoanalysis on this order as a repressed and unacknowledged set of assumptions. Thus he enacted something he could not present in words and active ideas. These implicit assumptions were later presented openly by Winnicott and Khan, and their presence in analysis ever since can let us approximate these two worlds that should no longer be held separate. There are, then, for Bollas two types of mind, metaphorically separated at birth, that can now be brought into new and creative juxtaposition. In following this theme, he explores the area of unformulated thought that has interested him for many years, as in his book <italic>The Freudian Moment.</italic> Though he sees Eastern thought as not psychologically minded in the Western sense, he sees it giving direction to unformulated experience that adumbrates Winnicott’s engagement with being through silent encounter, a study of the self previously avoided in psychoanalysis and in Western thought more generally. Joining the two modes of thought offers to bridge the maternal and paternal orders, to explore a middle ground between the Chinese emphasis on being, in which there is no sense of inner conflict, and the Western emphasis on inner conflict, in which there is little emphasis on being. Conflict in the West is a struggle against inner and outer forces confronting the individual. Conflict in Eastern thought is between the individual and the need to surrender to the natural order of society.</p>
<p>I have struggled before with Bollas’s use of the terms “maternal order” to signify early experience, primarily with the mother, and “paternal order” to signify later experience under the reorganizing influence of more verbal oedipal or at least triangular experience. This is a particular problem in the context of China, because Confucian morality dismisses actual mothers so completely in favor of loyalty to fathers as an organizing principle. Of course we are talking at different levels of meaning here, but there is no discussion in Bollas’s essay of the vexing question of a maternal order that so thoroughly dismisses and oppresses mothers and women, long viewed as subservient and even as property. We will need to have that discussion, even now with the rapidly evolving situation in China, where women are being empowered as never before under the impact of Communism, the one-child policy, and a sexual and economic revolution.</p>
<p>But this is a minor objection, more than offset by strengths such as Bollas’s interesting conjecture that Chinese culture manages to hide oedipal conflict by making men subservient to their fathers, and women to men, and that oedipal issues are effectively trumped by greater fealty to the group, including the family group. In addition, Bollas provides useful insight into Western analysis regarding the emphasis accorded the group mind in Chinese thought. The basing of morality on loyalty to certain figures in a hierarchy emphasizes the role of the group in organizing the individual mind. Freud did come to some understanding of the group, but it was not until Bion, Foulkes, and Pichon-Rivière in Argentina that group psychology seriously began to influence analytic theory. I will say tangentially that I believe this has something to do with the oft-mentioned idea that the West has a guilt-based, the East a shame-based, morality. Shame, whatever its developmental basis, is in itself neither lesser nor greater than guilt. Rather, the distinction is based on what source is attributed to the feeling of having done wrong. If morality derives from loyalty to the group, then shame is more powerful. If morality is about an autonomous self that harms another, then guilt is ascendant.</p>
<p>This book offers an extraordinary exploration of the philosophical underpinnings of the Eastern, and especially the Chinese, mind. And this is important. As I said early on, it was assumed that Mao successfully rid the Chinese mind of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. The Chinese have never been particularly religious, but they have a deep structure of mind and morality built on ideas dating back some twenty-five hundred years, ideas that have slowly evolved and that were still in place even as the final Qing dynasty tottered to an end at the beginning of the twentieth century, to be replaced forty years later by Mao and the Communists. But Mao was a complex and contradictory character, steeped (as Bollas points out) in Western thought we might even have approved of before he turned to inspiration from Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. He is represented in Bollas’s thought, but not as I would have expected, as the most destructive leader in the history of the world. Bollas cites Mao more than once as an exemplary modern Chinese poet and philosopher. Mao is indeed widely acknowledged to have been a more-than-decent poet. In closing his essay, Bollas quotes Mao’s “Kunlun Mountain,” written in October 1935:
<disp-quote>
<p>Who can judge</p>
<p>A thousand years of accomplishments or failures?</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>If I could lean on heaven, grab my sword,</p>
<p>And cut you in three parts,</p>
<p>I would send one to Europe, one to America,</p>
<p>and keep one part here</p>
<p>in China</p>
<p>that the world have peace</p>
<p>and the globe share the same heat and ice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He quotes Mao, then, in a kind of prophetic hope that we can all accept.</p>
<p>But what of the actual Mao that emerged from this moment, the Mao who wrote that revolution is not a pretty thing, who sacrificed friend and foe alike, whose policies based on whims and often against the advice of his most trusted advisors—when they dared speak at all—caused the greatest famine in human history, repeatedly traumatized an already staggering country and people, set China’s progress back by at least a generation, went as far as he could to destroy Chinese history and culture, and put his personal cult ahead of the good of his people? What of the Chinese mentality that is the legacy of a leader under whom something like seventy million people died though there was no war, more deaths than are attributed to any other leader in history?</p>
<p>Despite these reservations, I regard Bollas’s book as a vital resource for understanding the implications of the emerging encounter of psychoanalytic ideas with Chinese culture. Bollas’s study of the structure of two and a half millennia of Chinese thinking offers a great deal to analysts and students of mind who wish to venture across the Eastern horizon, helping also to understand the way modern psychoanalysis explores early implicit experience that underlies the later acquisition of verbal and narrative memory.</p>
<p>But in this encounter we will need to know how the Chinese are currently evolving in meeting the West. How has the change in the family wrought by the one-child rule (a policy the Chinese government seems about to end) affected the Chinese mind? We will need to understand the effects of a hundred and fifty years of trauma to the nation and to so many individuals and families, a kind of Chinese holocaust affecting the entire nation, in which the Chinese people were their own victims. We will need to explore how the current reemergence of traditional ideas and the meeting of the discipline of psychoanalysis—of which Bollas gives us his own elegant version—will evolve. And into what? Into a meeting, a confrontation, an encounter, a synthesis, or into an emergence in each culture of things that were repressed in favor of what was emphasized? Bollas holds that Western analysis took as an unacknowledged assumption the maternal order of early experience that is better, though differently, addressed in Eastern thought. Similarly, he holds that Chinese philosophical underpinnings have taken a psychological adaptation to conflicting loyalties as a kind of unspoken given that they can now usefully begin to find language for.</p>
<p>Reading Bollas’s essay, I came to see him as a de Tocqueville of the Chinese mind. Coming from a different culture, seeing things from the outside, he brings his own perspective to view a new-old world. What he sees and the way he sees it has enormous value, perhaps because of rather than in spite of his idiosyncratic point of view. He has given us a creative, thoughtful, evocative exploration of an ancient world that will be new and, for the eager traveler, full of mysterious wonders. Understanding these complexities takes work, but then the mysteries begin to open to yet other mysteries. To the psychoanalytic traveler with enough curiosity and stamina, such a trip to the East beckons to the horizon and beyond.</p>

<p>Early on, Bollas anticipates and tries to preempt charges of “Orientalism.” On page 2 of his introduction, he writes: “This book aims to explore the Eastern mind, but at the outset we face hazards inherent in dividing the world simplistically into different ways of thinking, and this author faces that challenge with trepidation. Is one really justified in using the terms ‘Eastern mind’, ‘Oriental mind’, ‘Chinese mind’—or, indeed, ‘Western mind’, ‘Occidental mind’ or ‘European mind’? Such categories are not only arbitrary and reductionist, they are also . . . in certain specific ways inaccurate. It is an irony of this exploration, then, that I will have to settle on part-truths to develop my argument. . . . when we refer to a difference between Eastern and Western ways of thinking we are talking not about different minds but about different <italic>parts</italic> of the mind.” He goes on to speak of <italic>tendencies</italic> to think in certain ways and the historical context of their development.</p>
