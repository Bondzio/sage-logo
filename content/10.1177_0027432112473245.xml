<title>Early Music Teacher Training</title>
<p>“George F. Root, Lowell Mason, and William B. Bradbury opened the New York Normal Musical Institute in April of 1853 in New York City,” begins Phillip M. Hash in a recent article in the <italic>JRME</italic>.</p>
<p>In a study published in the October 2012 <italic>JRME</italic> (Vol. 60, no. 3, pp. 267–93), Hash describes “the first long-term preparation program for singing-school masters, church choir directors, private instructors, and school music teachers in the United States.” The school was to last thirty-three years. It relocated to Reading, Massachusetts, in 1856, and it remained active throughout the Civil War. In 1872, it became the National Normal Musical Institute. After offering courses in a number of American cities, it found its final home in Elmira, New York, where it remained until it was disbanded in 1885.</p>
<p>Courses taught at the Institute included pedagogy, voice culture, music theory, and choral literature. Each term lasted about three months, and students were given the opportunity to take private lessons with expert teachers and musicians.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing from page 35 of a February 7, 1857, article in <italic>Musical Review</italic>, “Do Well All That You Do,” Hash describes a historical situation that still exists today: “A number of music educators during the nineteenth century worked in isolation and looked forward to meeting with colleagues.” The tradition of getting together to share new ideas and methods, solutions to problems, and the pleasure of networking with other professionals continues in the present with conferences of the National Association for Music Education (NAfME) and other music teacher organizations.</p>

<title>Make Arts Integration Work</title>
<p>Many teachers find integrating their curriculum with another content area challenging for several reasons: (1) Integrating music with other subjects should not be the burden of the music educator, but should be a responsibility shared by music educators and classroom teachers. Unfortunately, many music teachers are unable to establish the collaborative team needed for success. (2) Time is an obstacle. Besides normal teaching burdens and preparing for performances, classroom teachers often have their planning time while their students are in music class. (3) Integrated lessons need to explore the content objectives of <italic>both</italic> subject areas. Often music is used superficially to enhance the teaching of another subject.</p>
<p>In her article “Arts Integration: What’s the Problem?” in the January 2013 <italic>GMT</italic>, Brittany Nixon May offers suggestions on what music teachers can do to plan and execute lessons that successfully integrate music with other subject areas. She recommends starting small, picking one teacher or class for one lesson, unit, or project. She also recommends involving other teachers in <italic>your</italic> curriculum so they can integrate it into <italic>their</italic> teaching. May takes readers through several specific integration projects she worked on with colleagues.</p>

<title>Challenge Your Preconceptions!</title>
<p>How do preservice music teachers’ beliefs about teaching develop, and how do those beliefs influence their teaching practices? Margaret Schmidt conducted a literature review for the article “Preservice Teachers’ Beliefs and Practices” for the <italic>JMTE</italic>. Researchers in both general teacher education and music teacher education document the fact that preservice teachers enter teacher education programs with individually held ideas about teachers’ work and the kind of teacher they wish to become. Furthermore, research shows, these students filter their learning in the teacher education program through these preexisting beliefs. Schmidt provides a comprehensive review of the research and discusses approaches that music teacher educators have explored to help preservice teachers recognize and reflect on their beliefs.</p>
<p>Research suggests that not all experiences are equally educative and that music teacher educators should look for effective experiences that help students articulate their beliefs and integrate them with productive classroom practices. Schmidt discusses ways to help students challenge their beliefs and connect them with their teaching practice through teaching experiences in methods courses, teaching experiences beyond methods courses, feedback and guided self-assessment, and important relationships. Studies show that preservice teachers value opportunities to learn from actual teaching experiences and that peer teaching, field experiences, and freelance teaching experiences may contribute to development of understandings of and skills for teaching if explicit connections are made with university coursework. However, researchers point out that teaching experiences may be <italic>educative, noneducative</italic>, or <italic>miseducative</italic>. Some methods to offset noneducative and miseducative learning include self-assessment, feedback, live and recorded observation of self and other teachers, journals, and portfolios. These different formats help reveal preservice teachers’ beliefs and the complexities of how they process what they learn from their experiences.</p>

<title>Fearless Improvisation</title>
<p>Why are there more boys than girls in jazz ensembles? Is there a difference in how girls view the improvisation necessary to participate successfully in a jazz group? Michael Alexander wanted to learn more about the confidence, anxiety, and attitudes of beginning string improvisers.</p>
<p>After they had participated in a four-month improvisation curriculum, Alexander tested 121 middle school and high school string students using a form of the Fennema–Sherman Mathematics Attitudes Scales as modified for improvisation. In results that differed from previous studies, the confidence level of girls in Alexander’s study was not significantly different from any other group. Girls were significantly more anxious toward improvisation than were boys, and the results of the attitude comparisons were inconclusive.</p>
<p>Alexander cites research that suggests that anxious students be introduced to improvisation in private lessons or peer groups. He also states that his experience has shown that “students were much more eager to improvise than to listen to us <italic>talk</italic> about improvising” (p. 30).</p>
<p>Alexander’s study, “Fearless Improvisation: A Pilot Study to Analyze String Students’ Confidence, Anxiety, and Attitude toward Learning Improvisation,” is found in the November 2012 <italic>Update</italic>.
