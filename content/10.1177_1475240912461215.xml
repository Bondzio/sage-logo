<abstract>
<p>This essay draws on the author’s personal experiences as a head of school on three continents, over 20 years, as well as on some of his recent writings and talks. From Martin Luther King Jr’s idea of a world house is derived the concept of a ‘world school’. This project charts a way for national schools to develop world-minded graduates. It is claimed that the current state of international education has created an open space for all interested schools to learn both from and for the world. Five thematic visions of learning for the benefit of our world are discussed. Also outlined is a teacher profile for world school teaching, and the article concludes with a case study drawing on the author’s current school and changes that it has implemented over five years.</p>

<title>World schools – what’s in a name, and slogan?</title>
<p>The word ‘international’, as we know, has been used extensively in the appellation of many schools, from those that are of the now traditional international type to some speculative, fragile projects that trade on the term in the hope that being called an international school will lend lustre to their enterprise. I am not aware, however, of any similarly extensive use of the word ‘world’ in this context. There is a World Academy, and there are the United World Schools. In the movement that predates this recent venture, the United World Colleges, the ligature seems to be between the first word ‘united’ and ‘world’, more than between ‘world’ and ‘colleges’. The same is probably true of the phrase ‘IB World Schools’, which describes schools authorized to offer one or more of the four International Baccalaureate (IB) programmes: Primary Years Programme (PYP), Middle Years Programme (MYP), Diploma Programme (DP) and the new Career-related Certificate (CC). We are relatively open to the descriptor ‘world’, in the way that I wish to develop it. What is in the name ‘world school’, therefore, is the potential to generate guidelines and descriptions such as those in this essay.</p>
<p>The ‘way’ that I wish to develop tracks back to Martin Luther King Jr and his Nobel Peace Prize speech of December <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475240912461215">1964</xref>, <italic>The Quest for Peace and Justice</italic>. Towards the end of this presentation, King advances the potent image of a ‘world house’:<disp-quote>
<p>Some years ago a famous novelist died. Among his papers was found a list of suggested plots for future stories, the most prominently underscored being this one: ‘A widely separated family inherits a house in which they have to live together.’ This is the great new problem of mankind. We have inherited a big house, a great ‘world house’ in which we have to live together – black and white, Easterners and Westerners, Gentiles and Jews, Catholics and Protestants, Moslem and Hindu, a family unduly separated in ideas, culture, and interests who, because we can never again live without each other, must learn, somehow, in this one big world, to live with each other.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What a challenging problem, and what a scintillating emblem. The world house combines the global and the domestic, the planetary and the parochial. This world house must establish within it the world schools that will be exemplars for the future.</p>
<p>Quick and easy travel is one of the foundations of our world house. In a ruminative essay about world schools and their leading, pioneering capacities, it seems fitting therefore to say something about travel. Air travel is our most rapid form of mass, global journeying. Airports are shrines to contemporary life. Impermanence, bustle, congestion, cosmopolitanism, anxiety and excitement are just a few features of these mansions, some might say cathedrals, that are the locus of this form of travel. These features make airports fine places for pithy advertising slogans. HSBC, originally the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, frequently displays its favoured slogan in airports. It styles itself, here and elsewhere, as <italic>the world’s local bank.</italic> I have often tried to imagine how the global educational landscape would be changed if every one of our national schools, around the world, saw itself as the world’s local school. We know that the number of international schools around the world can be counted merely in the few thousands. We know, too, that the vast majority of schools – millions of them – are national institutions, and will remain so for a long, long time. It is the great educational challenge of our times to transform many of these national schools into world schools.</p>
<p>So what might happen if most of our national schools, around the world, envisioned themselves as the world’s local schools? Take this a step further and imagine national schools becoming the locals’ world schools, bringing the world in various ways to local people and communities. Such schools would be characterized by students who are curious, who are trained to ask critical questions, who reach judgments after weighing wide-ranging evidence, and who can move when appropriate from one knowledge or epistemological system to another. Diverse and blended pedagogical styles would be encouraged in such schools. Students and teachers would be knowledgeable about the world, they would want to learn all the time <italic>from the world</italic>, but at the same time they would be learning <italic>for the world.</italic> They would, therefore, apply their learning to change our world for the better and to address the great challenges of our time. A deep sense of public purpose, of learning to serve, would be systemic in such schools. Above all, perhaps, they would develop a positive instinct for difference, and a desire to learn from otherness. World schools like this would most definitely be producing national and global citizens, comfortable in their local identity but also cosmopolitan, completely at ease with otherness. The International Baccalaureate mission statement makes reference to the fact that ‘others, with their differences, can also be right’. Another HSBC airport medley makes play with this sentence: ‘Since 1865, we have understood that differences are what make the world such a remarkable place.’ True, indeed, and how much more remarkable might this world be if populated by world schools?</p>
<sec id="section2-1475240912461215">
<title>International education</title>
<p>There was a time, clearly, when international education was seen as the preserve of international schools. Such schools (and, as I have already mentioned, there is a limited although significant number of them) are predominantly day schools in large cities, their students are often enrolled from a globally itinerant community, their teachers tend habitually to travel the international circuit, their boards and their heads change regularly, and their academic curriculum is frequently one or more of the programmes of the International Baccalaureate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240912461215">George Walker (2011)</xref> has recently identified three phases of international education. In the first, a blend of pragmatism (the need for educational rigour and consistency for globally mobile families) and idealism (the promise of the covenant of the League of Nations and, later, the United Nations) saw the founding of about 50 international schools in the middle of the 20th century. Notable among these were the International School of Geneva (often known as Ecolint, an abbreviation of the French version of its name) and UNIS, the United Nations International School in New York. In the second phase, it became clear that both the practical benefits and the idealistic values of an international education need no longer be confined to international schools. Any national school that was forward looking and worldly minded could prepare its students successfully to be global citizens. In the third phase, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240912461215">Walker (2011</xref>: 16), the IB becomes a service and consulting organization for such institutions who are ‘looking to the IB, perhaps less for its programmes and more for its advice, support, development opportunities and recognition’. These three phases are outlined in a book specifically about the IB. In this article, I would open up additional frames of reference. World schools, whether international or national, should be seeking advice wherever it is available on how to become both the world’s local school and the locals’ world school.</p>

<sec id="section3-1475240912461215">
<title>Learning from the world</title>
<p>One way of doing this is to learn from, and assimilate, new ideas and practices from elsewhere. Learning from the world, our world of differences, would seem to be so very obvious. Yet most of us tend to benchmark ourselves against what we already know something about. Comparison with similarity is all too common: as the poet Shelley writes in his ‘Ode to a Skylark’, trying to describe and define something illuminating and full of wonder …<disp-quote>
<p>What thou art we know not; What is most like thee?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>National systems of education are notoriously inward-looking in this regard. Even in a highly interconnected world, where we should know easily the strong points of other ways of doing things, the conservatism and resilience of national systems is often astonishing. Comparative educators, and what I am suggesting has the potential to go much further than mere comparison, know exactly what I mean when it comes to bending one system in order to blend in aspects of another. Benchmarking with curiosity, humility, and comprehensiveness is now an essential criterion in any serious endeavour at local improvement. So what can we learn from the world, relatively speaking? Here are just a very few thoughts.</p>
<p>At the <italic>curricular level</italic>, we might ask why geography is so established in British-based systems and almost absent from American ones; we might insist on being able to learn from the French predilection for philosophy; we might wonder about the lowly place of economics and entrepreneurial studies in liberal arts academies; and we might speculate that mastery of two languages is essential, and perhaps that three is not abnormal, nor impossible. These are just a few, indicative examples.</p>
<p>When it comes to <italic>pedagogic practice</italic>, we might consider the positive effect of the limited use of mathematical calculators at the school level in China; the value of including participation in class discussions as a gradable element in the USA; the importance of memory training (by which I do not mean rote learning) in some eastern practices; the significance of enquiry-based Socratic learning through dialogue in the best of the west; the role of extensive reading in some systems; and the need for all teachers to understand the differences between norm-based and criterion-based assessment.</p>
<p>With regard to <italic>structural differences</italic>, let us look at differing perceptions of acceptable course load; multi-grade elementary school teaching of Mathematics in China; the later start to formal schooling in Finland; the distinctiveness of the house system in the British-based boarding school tradition; different ways of arranging and giving weight to sport or athletics; the importance of the gap year in some countries; and the markedly varying degrees of importance placed on teacher training and professional development.</p>
<p>Finally, in considering <italic>overarching philosophical frames</italic>, what might be learned from the influence of Buddhism in Thai education, theories of Ubuntu in southern Africa, or the implicit questioning by some traditions of those universality assumptions of the Enlightenment, the liberal values that underlie much of western educational thinking?</p>
<p>The possibilities are numerous. Learning from the world should be exciting, productive, challenging, and uplifting in a data demonstrable manner. The above are merely a few examples.</p>

<sec id="section4-1475240912461215">
<title>Learning for the world</title>
<p>For the purposes of this essay, I am selecting five areas when considering learning for the world. I like to think of them as visions for world schools that, if learned and practised meaningfully, will impact positively the world that current students will inherit, live in and change. They are, clearly, a selection from a potentially larger list, and by no means comprehensive. And they are thematic, and therefore do not address the structural realignments, including exterior and interior architecture, that schools are surely going to face, and the technologies that are changing how we do business. Nor do they necessarily address directly what are fashionably called 21st-century skills, although there are some areas of commonality with these. I remain sceptical about skills for a whole century when we are only just over one decade into it, and when all commentators readily admit that the pace of change is faster and deeper than ever before. I am not sure what skills for the past century might have been predicted with confidence and accuracy in 1912.</p>
<p>My five visions, all connected and overlapping, are not unexpected or novel. But all are of vital importance to world schools and, taken together, they form a powerful quintet. They are:</p>
<list id="list1-1475240912461215" list-type="bullet">

</list>
<sec id="section5-1475240912461215">
<title>Intellectual questing</title>
<p>My first vision is intellectualism. As I am approaching what I call intellectual questing, which means for me both searching and asking, as a practising head of school, I shall refer to one aspect of my own practice. At the end of every term, for 20 years now, I have written a letter to the extended family of the school of which I am a part. Here is an extract from a letter not too long ago. The paragraph below came immediately after a typical catalogue of successful achievements, by the students, in the artistic and athletic domains:<disp-quote>
<p>As it must always be, the foundation for all this activity is intellectual, the love of learning through the life of the mind. I went to Scotland during the Thanksgiving break as a guest speaker at an annual symposium called Scotland International. The title that I crafted was deliberately bivalent: <italic>Leading Skills for Leading Schools.</italic> At the institutional level, I urged that our schools should become ever more intellectual, a quality broader and deeper than the merely academic. In our world of such great complexity, desperate for leaders of caliber, the old saw that the best leaders are those with second-class intellects and first-class characters is insufficient. We need leaders with both intellect and character of the highest quality.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Character and intellectual development are often separated. Kurt Hahn said that the destiny of character occurs outside the classroom. However, classrooms can, should, and must be different now. Our schools must try to bring together character building and intellectual development. In the spirit of intellectual questing, we must ensure that our students, and their teachers, place a high priority on the interrogative mood. Asking probing questions must be at the heart of our learning. We must be more concerned to <italic>uncover</italic> syllabuses and content, rather than slavishly <italic>covering</italic> them. Too often the teachers’ lament is this: ‘There is just not enough time.’ I would rather hear the cry: ‘There is just not enough probing!’</p>
<p>To enlist a specific example, the IB Diploma Theory of Knowledge (TOK) course, and courses like it, have tremendous value in this context. Independent, critical thinking makes epistemological nomads of learners, and so does TOK. It also leads us to make interdisciplinary links that are unusual and creative. Schools concerned to foster this kind of intellectualism should consider more interdisciplinary courses and more collaborative group projects. It is heartening to see a revival of interdisciplinary courses in schools, and a different emphasis in these courses from that of the 1970s. Now there tends to be a genuine interfusion that honours the integrity of disciplines but that also makes the whole greater than the sum of the different disciplines that are being linked.</p>
<p>In high schools, especially in the USA where I currently work, we are too often constrained by what we think universities demand of us. My vision of intellectual questing dictates that we should protect and cherish the intellectualism that we seek to promote in our schools. We must retain these questioning, critical and creative aspects and not allow the universities to dictate matters. In the final analysis, universities respect this. If we are preparing our students in a properly intellectual, questing manner, the most rigorous universities all over the world will welcome them gladly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1475240912461215">
<title>Intercultural journeying</title>
<p>Let me move to my second vision, intercultural journeying. This is a move, from first to second, that ought to be more obvious than it sometimes seems. It is instructive to refer again to the IB Diploma. In the early history of the development of the Diploma Programme, in the late 1960s, there was an explicit link between critical thinking (one part of what I am calling intellectual questing) and international understanding. I feel that we sometimes lose sight of the need for and power of this connection. At Hotchkiss in the past few years we have created a new centre, the Center for Global Understanding and Independent Thinking. That coupling reinforces a link which we sometimes take for granted, or lose sight of completely. We should expect our world schools to practise and celebrate this as a matter of course. There is an easy movement from the spirit of inquiry and making creative links to the promotion of the international understanding underpinning pan-nationalism. On one level, each is an analogue for the other.</p>
<p>In the later years of the 20th century, people who were geopolitical progressives were very much focused on international understanding. Such a focus could often cut across party and partisan lines. It gave rise to the proliferation of concepts such as global citizenship, world-mindedness, and cosmopolitanism, all useful outgrowths of the debates around international understanding. I am now inclined to substitute the term intercultural understanding for international understanding. This allows for the possibility of celebrating and learning from difference across groups that might not be only national. After all, age and gender groupings have distinct cultures, and this can be obvious, and obviously utilized, within schools. It is hugely significant to realize, taking to heart the IB mission statement, that others with their differences can also be right. It can be even more startling to learn that we, with our apparent similarities, can ourselves be different – in other words that there are heterogeneities close to home that we sometimes do not see. Intercultural journeying, distant and local, produces such revelations. We must remember that to change the world, in ways small and big, we have to start doing new things but also stop doing some things that are habitual. One of those to stop is the complacency of resting within our own cultures, and of seeing these as seamless. World schools should insist on this.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1475240912461215">
<title>Spatial sensitizing</title>
<p>Community building in schools flows naturally from intercultural awareness, from the harmonizing of differences. I am approaching such a sense of community, and community service, in spatial terms. This is an unusual angle on the topic. Let me explain. The author <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240912461215">John McPhee (1965)</xref> once wrote about Bill Bradley in his basketball playing days at Princeton. Senator Bradley later ran unsuccessfully for the Presidency of the USA. The book is called <italic>A Sense of Where You Are</italic>. Its title derives from Bradley’s response to a question about how he always seemed to be in the right place on the court at exactly the right time, both to assist his fellow players and to execute extraordinary individual plays. Bradley used the phrase ‘a sense of where you are’ to describe the perfect intuitive knowledge, born of thousands of hours of practice, that allowed him to see the court and both teams as a moving map drawn around him and his place in the game. Such spatial sensitivity is a useful metaphor for developing a sense of community, individually and collectively. If we have a sense of where we are, and that entails knowing where others are, this enhances our capacities to intuit the flow of the whole game. We need to make opportunities in our schools for practising this skill. Our students will be learning for their world by doing so.</p>
<p>This third vision, connected to the second, grows from the insight that genuine intercultural literacy recognizes human interdependence at a profound level. Community service certainly builds upon this and once we feel our near and far interdependence in the heart, we understand and value humanness and humility quite differently. This is one of the defining features of our humanity and our human nature. For me, a South African, the insight is encapsulated most elegantly in a Zulu saying: <italic>umuntu ngamuntu ngabantu</italic> (a person becomes human through others).</p>
<p>Many schools speak, in mission statements and brochures, of community. A significant purpose of all schools is to be builders of community, and schools – of all types – are very well positioned to do this. People in schools share a defined space and a common purpose. Most people in schools, the students, are in their early years and formative stages. Owing to changing family patterns and the pressures on a sense of community in our fragmented and fractured world outside the school, the world of the school can provide a healing balm for its participants. Teachers recall only too easily how often parents tell them, directly and indirectly, that they must provide the structures of pastoral care and community that the parents cannot.</p>
<p>What should we expect from such respectful communities, exemplary worlds in miniature? The recipe is quite simple and here are a few basic ingredients: cooperation, encouragement of teamwork, discouragement of rampant individualism, the delaying of gratification, the building of trust and the care for those in need. The community service that more and more schools require, quite rightly, builds and reinforces this. I use a working typology that recognizes three types of service typical in schools: the first is when students, and teachers, perform essential tasks for the benefit of the school community, such as cleaning classrooms; the second consists of doing productive work for members of disadvantaged communities outside the school, like raising funds for deserving individuals and organizations, or making things (blankets for example) for those in need; the third is the face-to-face work that we know affects the doer as much as if not more than the receiver, such as working with elderly people, or those with disabilities, or victims of illness. Any or all of these types might stimulate an interest in public service, the training of agents of social change, which can also be a distinct type of its own.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1475240912461215">
<title>Experiential doing</title>
<p>Community service is a substantial genre of experiential learning, and leads naturally into this my fourth vision. But learning by doing, through hands-on experience, includes much more than service. In 1996, UNESCO published a report on education in the 21st century. The international commission chaired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240912461215">Jacques Delors (1996)</xref> called its challenging and exciting document <italic>Learning: the Treasure Within</italic>. The Delors Report, as it is usually known, identified four general ‘pillars’ of learning (chapter 4). These are:</p>
<list id="list2-1475240912461215" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>learning to know;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>learning to do;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>learning to live together;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>learning to be.</p></list-item></list>
<p>I gloss these as cognitive, experiential, social (to some degree intercultural), and existential knowledge. The inclusion of experiential learning is surprising, and notable.</p>
<p>My working definition of experiential education is that it promotes learning through direct experience, often outside the classroom, at times not directly related to academic courses, frequently not graded, and sometimes not mediated through language, or academic discourse and practice. But as with service, it is useful to work with a three-way typology: experiential learning that takes place in the classroom, through the immediate apprehension of what is imaginatively shown rather than told; that which occurs outside the classroom but is related directly to the discourse of the classroom, such as field studies or focused trips; and then the work of doing things, such as growing food or learning a sport, which has a value in and of itself that is not academic. All three, but especially the last, can act as useful counterbalances to the virtual, electronic learning that is more and more a modern, and desirable, aspect of the way we do things now. And all three promote learning for the world in forging links between the academic and the practical, learning and labour.</p>
<p>John Dewey is one significant name in the annals of experiential educators. Although he never uses the word ‘experiential’ in his brief classic published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240912461215">1938</xref>, <italic>Experience and Education</italic>, he writes insightfully about his topic in ways that are strikingly contemporary: progressive education is based on experience but experience-based learning can occur in traditional classrooms; experience can lead both to educative and to ‘miseducative’ outcomes; educative experience is characterized by continuity and interaction; and it is important to select experiences so as to construct a curriculum of experiences that build on each other and move away from the merely episodic.</p>
<p>Schools seeking to become world schools, and to build experiential learning more deliberately into their curricula, will need to make the time and provide the training for this. When they do, they will quickly discover that experiential education enhances traditional academics. This type of learning builds confidence, encourages risk taking, reduces the fear of failure, gives oxygen to collaboration, nurtures imagination, allows reverie, and grows a taproot for academic learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1475240912461215">
<title>Sustainable living</title>
<p>Environmental education has become a powerful locus for experiential doing, and learning. The Brundtland Report of October <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240912461215">1987</xref> is a milestone in environmentalism. Many are familiar with its categorization of sustainable development as that kind of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Fifteen years before Brundtland, however, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240912461215">Club of Rome (1972)</xref> released <italic>The Limits to Growth</italic>, a work that has sold over 12 million copies and is one of the best selling environmental books published to date. The idea of limits in the ecological context has given rise to the slightly different concept of sustainable living, which I would gloss as the ethics, culture and practices of a lifestyle that is based upon limits and regeneration, and not the inevitability of growth and development.</p>
<p>Even if we take the practice of sustainable development seriously, much, much more so than recent world conferences have succeeded in doing, there is the possibility that we are inexorably making our one, blue planet unfit for human habitation. The responsibility of the educated for this has been alarming. We need to acknowledge that our educational programs have assisted this failure but that they also possess the power now to do something about it. We might be faced with educating our students for human survival. What are our schools doing about this, about promoting sustainable living? What they should be doing is insisting on the primacy of environmentalism. There are clear dangers in suggesting that one academic area is the mother of all others. I am not doing that. In making environmentalism primary, I am not advocating an epistemological but rather an ecological and social imperative. As I have written elsewhere (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240912461215">Walker, 2011</xref>, p 168), all education, for now, must be environmental education in certain respects. Not only must we combine economics and ecology, and geography and the environment, and statistics with patterns of demographic change, to give just three examples, but we must expect teachers to infuse their practice with a spirit of environmentalism. There must be a place for ecological literacy in the core of our school programs and graduating requirements. There should also be practical challenges and projects that schools should be required to take up. In the USA, some of these are the Green Cup Challenge, the Green Schools Alliance and the 20/20 program sponsored by the National Association of Independent Schools.</p>
<p>We need also to find ways of communicating these issues graphically. Asking probing questions in this area returns me to the interrogative mood of my first vision. Did you know that some humans are now suffering from Nature Deficit Disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240912461215">Louv, 2005</xref>)? With more than half of humanity already living in urban environments, and the number of megacities (those of over 10 million people) reaching 26 by 2020, did you know that many people actually believe that milk is made in plastic bottles? Did you know that the average annual water consumption of a golf course is the same as that of a village of 15,000 people? Did you know that in the 22nd century, in the same way that we look incredulously at intelligent ancestors who accepted slavery, humankind will look back at us and say: how could they have eaten meat, when they knew all about the environmental cost of raising animals? Did you know that 300,000 people (and rising) die every year now because of climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475240912461215">Global Humanitarian Forum, 2009</xref>)? We need to be forceful and intentionally shocking in ways such as these, because the silent crisis demands volume. World schools need to be loud in this area.</p>

<title>Teachers and world schools</title>
<p>Near the beginning of this essay, I touched on some of the qualities that we might expect to cultivate, and find, in the students who inhabit world schools. The IB learner profile characterizes succinctly such attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240912461215">IB, 2012</xref>). So, too, do many individual institutional statements produced by teachers in particular schools. What is not nearly as common are statements about the qualities that we might expect from teachers in such schools. Here is a basic, work-in-progress typology that addresses this matter.</p>
<p>A few years ago, in one of my end-of-term letters to the extended Hotchkiss family, I invited responses to the question: ‘What makes a great teacher?’ I selected those that seemed to me the strongest and most striking. Then I worked with a colleague, Dr Manjula Salomon, to couple each of these with a complementary quality that had more of a world reach to it. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475240912461215">Figure 1</xref> (overleaf) shows that composite list. World schools need, and must aim to produce, such instructors in their classrooms.</p>

<title>A specific example</title>
<p>In the spirit of having a ‘sense of where you are’, I shall use my current school as a specific example. The Hotchkiss School was founded in 1891. The founders and first leaders of Hotchkiss saw their school as a national school from early on. This was implicit in the joint motivations of Maria Bissell Hotchkiss and Timothy Dwight. She, a wealthy widow, wished for an unassuming academy to educate village and farm boys, and provided (most unusually for the time) a substantial scholarship endowment of US$200,000 for this purpose. Meanwhile he, the President of Yale University, wished for another feeder school to Yale. Meld these, and the resulting amalgam is a potent blend of the local and national, focused intently on academic excellence and public purpose.</p>
<p>The national perspective soon becomes explicit in Hotchkiss publications. In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240912461215">1920</xref> publication <italic>Hotchkiss School: Its Record, Its Needs</italic>, the phrase ‘a great national school’ is repeated. Here’s one instance:<disp-quote>
<p>The first Trustees and masters included distinguished educators whose avowed purpose was the creation of a great national school which should be devoted to the highest type of education and public service, and which would be freed by its unrivalled location and its initial endowment from many of the difficulties that beset other schools.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this document the conception of ‘a great national school’ entails drawing students from all over the nation. Much more important, on the qualitative side, the document spells out certain values and characteristics: a dedication to service, the development of character, democracy, mental and physical training, and leadership.</p>
<p>In a Hotchkiss campaign document published just after the Second World War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475240912461215">The Hotchkiss School, 1946</xref>), explicit reference is made to ‘the attitudes of international living’. This precedes the following matter-of-fact statements: ‘the job we face as a people is no less than the expanding, the regeneration and redirection of the foundations of American culture and democracy. In the coming atomic age, we shall have either a unified world founded on peace, good will and international law or no world at all’. This has a resounding contemporary ring to it. America needs the world and the world needs America. This symbiosis and synergy possesses the potential to revivify both.</p>
<p>So how exactly do we make a national school like this more of a world school in its conception of itself, its reach and the experience that it offers its students, faculty and staff, without losing any of those local and national traditions that are so endearing and enduring? And, more important, how might other schools, different in context, resources and traditions, effect similar changes and reorientations? Are there lessons that can be shared, and made replicable in certain ways? Is it possible for all schools, rich and poor, to become world schools in meaningful but different ways?</p>
<p>In conclusion, I shall outline very briefly some of the more important steps that we have taken in recent years to become more of a world school. I shall not spell out in any formalistic fashion the ways in which these relate to earlier parts of this essay, but it will become clear that these derive from what I have described as <italic>learning from and for the world</italic>. Hotchkiss is now part of the Global Education Benchmark Group. Although still a body which is essentially national, we are endeavouring through this group, and in other more individual ways, to learn from and incorporate productive ideas and practices from elsewhere. At the curricular level, we have used the IB Further Mathematics course as a guide in developing our own Further Math: Statistics and Analysis course. We are also trying out, as a pilot, a course called Ways of Understanding that draws on, and extends, many of the essential insights of the IB Diploma TOK course.</p>
<p>In the area of interdisciplinary studies, we have spent some years designing a most exciting humanities program for all students in Grades 9 and 10. This brings together English, history, philosophy and religion, and an arts elective. The collaborative teamwork of both teachers and students that is characteristic of this course, and the skills it promotes of making links across previously unconnected areas, are changing the cultural landscape of the school. Interdisciplinary courses like this function almost as an analogue of the interdependence at a social level that is an essential feature of world-mindedness. In a new course on humans and water, we are trying something similar at the elective level in the final two grades.</p>
<p>We are building a curriculum in experiential education. Each year has a class theme, starting with sustainability in Grade 9 and moving through interculturalism, and then community service, to citizenship and leadership. Our location in the country, with acres of woodland and a recently acquired working farm, provides a ready laboratory for work in sustainability. A new biomass heating plant for the entire campus, which will burn wood chips from sustainably harvested local forests, is nearing completion. We are committed to becoming energy neutral by 2020, and we are using this as a forum for educational as well as practical opportunities.</p>
<p>Our membership of organizations such as Global Connections and the Round Square is helping us to see ourselves much more as a world school. The Round Square is an organization of close to one hundred schools around the world, all linked to the educational thinking of Kurt Hahn, that espouses the acronym IDEALS: internationalism, democracy, environmentalism, adventure, leadership and service. We use technology to link in real time with students in their classrooms in other countries. We have formal partnerships with schools in different parts of the world that also see themselves as what I am calling world schools.</p>
<p>In the intercultural domain, our growing diversity as a community, and our growing sense of the nuances of diversity beyond such surface features as skin colour, allow us to use our own intercultural resources in addition to those from outside the school community. Some students recently made an award-winning short documentary called <italic>My Flag</italic> about a school-wide debate initiated by some Chinese students concerning whether we should display the Tibetan flag in our dining hall, alongside the flags of other nations represented in our community. In schools such as Hotchkiss, we are able to create a world school demographic through the judicious use of financial aid to build a variegated student cohort of inclusive excellence.</p>
<p>In human resources, we have created posts at the assistant head of school level for a director of global initiatives and a director of environmental initiatives. A gap year coordinator encourages students to take a year out before college, not an American custom at all, and our students are thinking more about the possibilities of college and university study abroad. They are also more and more aware of the world outside this boarding community in the country, and of their place in it. They initiate projects readily and comprehensively that focus on and, in some cases, try to ameliorate national and international issues. Their awareness and attitudes are changing. This is exciting, transformative, and meaningful.</p>
<p>Parents are sharp observers of such changes in their children, and I conclude with a comment from a parent. This comes from an e-mail commenting on the growing diversity, nationally and internationally, among our students: ‘this (diversification) is precisely what makes Hotchkiss such a remarkable place, by allowing students the ability to get to know the world through personal friendships with peers from different cultures and geographies. We believe that it is through this open understanding of each other that a Hotchkiss student can become a true citizen of the world, and a more compassionate human being’.</p>
