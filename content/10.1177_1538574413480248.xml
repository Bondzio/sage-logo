<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Open surgical repair of ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs), despite advancements in perioperative care, is associated with high mortality rates. In patients treated for acute rupture, 30-day mortality rates of up to 24% and 1-year mortality of 42% have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413480248">1</xref></sup> Postoperative complications include myocardial infarction and acute renal or respiratory failure. Additionally, paraplegia rates, depending on aneurysm extent, approach 30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413480248">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Branched stent grafts have been developed to address this problem and enable repair of TAAAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413480248">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Branched endografting is a technically challenging procedure and is associated with the use of a significant volume of iodinated contrast, contributing to postoperative renal dysfunction or failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413480248">3</xref></sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413480248">4</xref>
</sup> Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is an alternative contrast medium, and its use as the primary contrast agent in standard endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413480248">5</xref></sup> Although there are few complications related to the use of CO<sub>2</sub>, its usage is limited due to inferior image quality in comparison to iodinated contrast.</p>
<p>Current branched grafts are custom-made devices. The planning, construction, and delivery of these devices limit their use in emergency cases.</p>
<p>The purpose of this case report is to describe the use of an off-the-shelf branched stent graft and the use of CO<sub>2</sub> as an exclusive contrast medium for repair of a ruptured TAAA.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 64-year-old male was transferred, from a peripheral hospital, to our department, with an 11.5-cm TAAA and concomitant abdominal and back pain. He had been seen, a year and a half ago, as an outpatient, and given the aneurysm’s complex anatomy demonstrated in computed tomography (CT) angiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413480248">Figure 1</xref>) and the patient’s multiple medical problems, he was considered to be unfit for any kind of intervention. In the interim, there was a considerable increase in the size of the aneurysm.</p>

<p>His past medical history included an infrarenal open aortic aneurysm repair, hypertension, prostate cancer, ischemic heart disease [stress echocardiography: ejection fraction 65%], and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with poor cardiopulmonary exercise results (anerobic threshold: 10 mL/kg/min).</p>
<p>On transfer, the patient was hemodynamically stable and a noncontrast CT scan, due to severe renal impairment (creatinine: 350 μmol/L), revealed a large type IV TAAA with signs of contained rupture. There were multiple renal arteries, 3 on the right side and 2 on the left, all of which were stenosed.</p>
<p>A decision was made to proceed with emergency repair of the aneurysm. Due to the patient’s poor general condition and renal impairment, he underwent endovascular repair using an off-the-shelf branched stent graft. CO<sub>2</sub> was used as the exclusive contrast agent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1538574413480248">
<title>Technique</title>
<p>Under general anesthesia, an 8-mm axillary conduit was established to facilitate catheterization of the target vessels from above. A calibrated pigtail was advanced by percutaneous puncture of the left femoral artery. The origin of the left renal artery was located posteriorly and therefore difficult to visualize using CO<sub>2</sub> as contrast agent. Thus, it was catheterized through the axillary conduit with a 6F Flexor sheath (Cook, Cook Medical Europe, Ireland) and a 5F multipurpose catheter (Cordis, Cordis Europe, Belgium). The tip of the sheath was placed close to the orifice of the left renal artery to allow for the injection of CO<sub>2</sub> into the artery and to serve as a marker. The multipurpose catheter, positioned in the left renal artery, was stabilized with a 0.014-PT Graphix guidewire (Boston Scientific Clonmel, Ireland) placed far out in the peripheral branch. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was catheterized using a 5F multipurpose catheter Cordis and stabilized with a 0.014-PT Graphix guidewire (Boston Scientific; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574413480248">Figure 2</xref>). The origin of the celiac, superior mesenteric, and right renal arteries were located ventrally and could therefore easily be visualized efficiently with CO<sub>2</sub> injected through a pigtail catheter.</p>

</fig>
<p>All of the stent graft pieces were advanced over a 0.035 through-and-through wire, placed from the axillary conduit and extended to the right common femoral artery.</p>
<p>Outside of common practice, the branched piece was placed first, defining its position by repeated CO<sub>2</sub> injections visualizing the well-marked left renal artery and SMA on AP and lateral views.</p>
<p>In order to achieve an hemostatic seal at the top, a second piece was placed proximally. Positioning the tube piece was defined by calculating the position from the branched piece and using the TeraRecon nonenhanced study and comparing this with a previous contrast-enhanced study, since the aneurysm’s anatomy had not changed.</p>
<p>After deployment of the branched and tube grafts, catheterization of the target vessels was performed through a 12F Flexor sheath (Cook) that was inserted from the axillary conduit, over the through-and-through wire, which subsequently had been replaced with a 0.014 PT Graphix guidewire (Boston Scientific). The right common femoral artery was then repaired.</p>
<p>Initially, the previously marked accessory left renal artery was catheterized by repetitively injecting CO<sub>2</sub> through the 6F sheath from above. A 6 × 60 mm Fluency Bard stent graft (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, Arizona, USA) was used for bridging the left accessory renal artery, due to its small diameter This was extended with a 6 × 30 mm Absolute Pro Abbot (Abbot Vascular, Illinois, USA) bare stent plus a 6 × 60 mm Zilver Flex bare stent (Cook). To secure fixation into the sleeve, a 6 × 22 mm V12 Atrium covered stent was deployed and ballooned to 7 mm. Cannulation of the right accessory renal was difficult due to its ventral take off and tightly stenotic origin. Iodinated contrast of 1.5 mL (240 mg/mL) was injected to define the origin of the artery. A 0.014 PT Graphix guidewire (Boston Scientific) was used to catheterize the right renal artery and a second 0.014 wire, used as a buddy wire, was applied. One of the wires was exchanged for a 0.018 Road runner Extra support guidewire (Cook), through a Progreat catheter, Terumo (Leuven, Belgium). A 3-mm low profile Cook balloon was advanced over the road runner wire and the origin of the artery was dilated. The 2 wires were exchanged for a 0.035 Rosen-curved guidewire (Cook), over which a bigger balloon performed full dilation of the stenotic artery. All the additional steps were repeated in the same way as per left accessory renal artery. Finally, the SMA and celiac trunk were catheterized and bridged as per protocol, using a 9 × 60 mm Fluency Bard stent graft and reinforced with a 7 × 60 mm Zilver Flex stent (Cook).</p>
<p>Total blood loss was 1800 mL with total screening time of 180 minutes. Iodinated contrast of 1.5 mL was used. The patient had an uneventful recovery, and at 1 month follow-up, he was found to be in good health. His renal function had improved with a creatinine level of 194 μmol/L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574413480248">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Multibranched stent grafts have been used to treat TAAAs for over 10 years. Branched devices accommodate for variation in aneurysm anatomy; this allows for minor errors in planning and deployment. This has allowed their use to be applied as an off-the-shelf device for TAAAs and potentially therefore for ruptured TAAAs. In a series of 66 patients, a standardized, off-the-shelf, multibranched stent graft for the treatment of TAAAs has been used in 88% of the cases that would otherwise have been treated using customized stent grafts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574413480248">6</xref></sup> This obviously eliminates the manufacturing delays that can occur when planning such cases, allowing for immediate repair of symptomatic aneurysms.</p>
<p>The off-the-shelf device used in this case had sleeves that were orientated at 1, 12, 9, and 3 o’clock for the celiac, SMA, and renal arteries, respectively. Given the large discrepancy in their orientation, the device had to be placed 2 cm above the target vessels, calling for longer bridging stents.</p>
<p>Renal dysfunction after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair is an increasingly recognized problem. The use of iodinated contrast media during EVAR for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency often produces deterioration in renal function, including potential allergic response and the need for high-pressure injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574413480248">7</xref></sup> The CO<sub>2</sub> angiography has been used to limit the risk of contrast nephrotoxicity; it has been successfully used as an adjunct to contrast during the performance of EVAR in over 50 patients in our center without an increase in aneurysm-related morbidity, mortality, or endoleak rate (unpublished data). The CO<sub>2</sub> is not without its weaknesses, distributing only ventrally and not dorsally, this can be compensated using injection of CO<sub>2</sub> through a sheath placed just above the target vessel, as in our case.</p>
<p>This technique demonstrates 2 important concepts for future consideration in the treatment of ruptured TAAAs. The use of CO<sub>2</sub> as a contrast agent in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction and the use of off-the-shelf branched stent grafts for emergency repair of TAAAs.</p>
