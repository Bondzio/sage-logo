<title>Background:</title>
<p>We aimed to investigate the effects of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and non-pulsatile CPB techniques on oxidative stress and the respiratory system in the current study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0267659112449036">
<title>Materials and Methods:</title>
<p>The patients were allocated into three different groups according to perfusion techniques, as follows: off-pump CABG group (n=10); pulsatile CPB (n=11); and non-pulsatile CPB group (n=11).

<sec id="section3-0267659112449036">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The postoperative increase in the carbonyl level was significantly lower in the off-pump CABG group compared to the other two groups, while there was no significant difference between the pulsatile and non-pulsatile CPB groups with respect to carbonyl levels.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiac surgical procedures performed using cardiopulmonary bypass lead to activation of systemic inflammation which, in turn, contributes to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112449036">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112449036">2</xref></sup> During extracorporeal circulation, blood and its elements are continuously in contact with foreign substances and surfaces. Inflammation begins after blood anticoagulated with heparin comes into contact with the non-endothelial surfaces of extracorporeal circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112449036">3</xref></sup> As a result of the activation of circulating neutrophils, an increase has been noted in interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) cytokine levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112449036">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112449036">4</xref></sup> The development of respiratory failure, pulmonary damage, and brain damage, which all begin with the inflammatory system activation following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), have made it necessary to develop different cardiovascular surgical techniques.</p>
<p>Non-pulsatile CPB is a conventional perfusion technique which provides a continuous flow. Another technique is pulsatile CPB, which is thought to be a more physiological form of perfusion, providing pulsatile flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112449036">5</xref></sup> Moreover, the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) technique, avoiding extracorporeal circulation, has also been developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112449036">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>We aimed to investigate the effects of classical on-pump non-pulsatile CPB, on-pump pulsatile CPB and off-pump CABG techniques on oxidative stress and the respiratory system in the present study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0267659112449036" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This clinical study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee.</p>
<sec id="section7-0267659112449036">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>The patients were assigned prospectively to the three groups according to the perfusion techniques used during the CPB procedure, as follows: (1) off-pump CABG group (n=10); (2) pulsatile CPB group (n=11); and (3) non-pulsatile CPB group (n=11). Patients were assigned to an off-pump strategy based upon surgeon preference. In those assigned to the on-pump strategy, they were stratified sequentially one to one to pulsatile and non-pulsatile perfusion. Exclusion criteria were: the need for emergency coronary revascularization, the occurrence of an acute myocardial infarction within the last month, an ejection fraction (EF) &lt;30%, a creatinine level &gt;2 mg/dL and/or the presence of acute renal failure, the presence of an active infectious disease, the presence of a systemic inflammatory disease, the presence of a collagen tissue disease, the presence of a metastatic disease and/or receiving immunosuppressive treatment, a history of cerebrovascular disease within the last 6 months, and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0267659112449036">
<title>Premedication and Anesthesia</title>
<p>All patients were premedicated with 10 mg oral diazepam 12 hours before the operation and 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneous morphine sulfate and 20-50 mg/kg intravenous cefazolin sodium 30 minutes before the operation. Lead II standard electrocardiographic recordings were used for monitoring patients in the operating room. Then, a pulse oximeter probe was placed on the left index finger for monitoring arterial oxygen saturation. Venous catheterization of the left cephalic or brachial vein was performed using a 16-gauge cannula and arterial catheterization of the right radial artery was performed using an 18-gauge cannula. Under sterile conditions, a central venous line was inserted into the right internal jugular or subclavian vein using the Seldinger technique after induction of local anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental 5-7 mg/kg. For the maintenance of anesthesia, a muscle relaxant, pancuronium, was administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg and an analgesic, remifentanil, was administered at a dose of 0.1-0.5 μg/kg by continuous infusion. If required, an inhalation anesthetic, isoflurane, was used. A rectal temperature probe was placed for monitoring the core temperature of the patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0267659112449036">
<title>Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting technique</title>
<p>Immediately after the median sternotomy, all patients were anticoagulated with 100-200 U/kg of heparin to maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) greater than 250 seconds. An Octopus IV tissue stabilizer (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used for partial immobilization of the myocardial surface during the construction of the distal anastomoses. An intracoronary shunt was used to facilitate the anastomosis. The heart was positioned using deep pericardial traction sutures and the Starfish heart positioner (Medtronic), an apical suction device. Revascularization of the right coronary artery (RCA) was performed first, followed by the construction of the distal anastomoses of the circumflex (Cx) artery territory, and the left anterior descending artery (LAD) territory. The left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was anastomosed to the LAD in all patients. Following the construction of the distal anastomoses, the saphenous vein was anastomosed to the aorta with a side clamp.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0267659112449036">
<title>Pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass technique</title>
<p>The patients were anticoagulated with 300-400 U/kg of heparin to maintain an ACT greater than 400 seconds. CPB was initiated following cannulation of the aorta and the right atrium. A Stockert SIII pulsatile roller pump (Stockert Instrumente GmbH, Munich, Germany) and a membrane type oxygenator (Dideco Compact Flo Evo, Sorin Group, Mirandola, Italy) were used. The pump prime solution contained 1000-1500 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution to maintain an hematocrit at a level of 26±2. Pump flow was set at 2.2-2.4 L/m/m<sup>2</sup> to maintain the mean pulsatile arterial pressure between 50-70 mmHg. The body temperature of the patient was cooled down to 30°C. For myocardial protection, potassium-blood cardioplegic solution was administered every 20 minutes and, additionally, cold (4°C) Isolyte S solution was applied topically to the surface of the heart at the same intervals. Cross-clamp time (minutes) and CPB time (minutes) were recorded.</p>

<sec id="section12-0267659112449036">
<title>Collection of blood samples</title>
<p>The study procedures were initiated after obtaining informed consent from the patients. The blood samples were drawn from the central venous catheter. The first blood sample was drawn just prior to the operation, following the induction of anesthesia, the second sample was drawn following the construction of the proximal anastomoses and termination of the extracorporeal circulation via the administration of protamine sulfate 0 hours postoperatively, and the third sample was drawn 6 hours postoperatively. The blood samples were drawn into plain tubes and were transferred to the Central Biochemistry Laboratory. Serum samples were prepared by centrifugation of the blood samples and then stored at -80°C until analysis. Laboratory analyses were performed in the Central Biochemistry Laboratory at the end of the study.</p>
<p>Serum carbonyl levels were measured in serum samples obtained preoperatively, 0 hours postoperatively and 6 hours postoperatively, using a colorimetric assay kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA).</p>
<p>All the patients were evaluated preoperatively by a pulmonary specialist at the Department of Pulmonary Medicine, and those with COPD were excluded. All the patients underwent pulmonary function tests (PFTs) preoperatively and 5 days postoperatively. All PFTs were performed at the Department of Pulmonary Medicine as well.</p>
<p>Arterial blood gas measurements were performed preoperatively and 24 hours and 5 days postoperatively, without supplemental oxygen. Blood gas monitoring was performed by cardiovascular surgery research fellows who obtained arterial blood samples from the radial artery, either by direct puncture or by blood withdrawal from the previously placed radial artery cannula, using a heparinized insulin syringe. Then, the samples were immediately analyzed in the blood gas analyzer (Nova Critical Care express, Nova Biomedical Corp., Waltham, MA, USA) in the Cardiovascular Surgery Intensive Care Unit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0267659112449036">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine whether the data were normally distributed. For normally distributed variables, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and for non-normally distributed variables the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance was used in the comparison of more than two independent groups. The comparison of time-dependent changes in more than two independent groups was performed by the repeated measures ANOVA for normally distributed variables and by the Friedman test for non-normally distributed variables. The Bonferroni correction was used since intra-group comparisons at different time points and inter-group comparisons at each time point were performed. The Wilcoxon test was used for the comparison of two dependent groups. A Chi-squared test was used for the comparison of rates in two independent groups.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were no significant differences between the three groups with respect to baseline characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659112449036">Table 1</xref>). The LIMA (left internal mammary artery) was used for all the patients. The bilateral IMA (internal mammary artery) was not used for any patient. A left chest tube was inserted for all the patients and a right chest tube was used for none. No significant difference was determined between the drainage amount and transfusion rates in the three groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the great progress in cardiac surgery with the development of novel methods and equipment during the last 4 decades, the development of postoperative complications such as respiratory failure, pulmonary damage, cognitive dysfunction and brain damage resulting from inflammatory system activation during extracorporeal circulation and reperfusion has prompted cardiovascular surgeons to search for different techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112449036">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112449036">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The best method to reduce the inflammatory response is to perform CABG without using CPB. Although the effects of three different techniques (pulsatile and non-pulsatile classical pump techniques and off-pump CABG technique) on the inflammatory system have been investigated in a study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112449036">9</xref></sup> a clinical study simultaneously evaluating the effects of each technique on carbonyl levels and the respiratory system does not exist, yet. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to simultaneously compare the effects of the three techniques on oxidative status and the respiratory system.</p>
<p>Off-pump CABG surgery without CPB has been performed increasingly in recent years. The goal is to avoid the negative effects of CPB and body cooling methods on the physiological systems. This has incredibly extended the spectrum of indications of cardiac surgery. It has been demonstrated in several studies that this technique was superior to CABG surgery with CPB, especially in patients over 70 years of age, patients with extremely low EF, re-operation cases, patients with cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, bleeding disorder, patients with severe aortic calcifications or patients in whom blood and blood products cannot be used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112449036">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112449036">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Controversy exists concerning the positive and negative effects of the pulsatile CPB technique. One of the controversial issues has concerned hemolysis. On the other hand, the significance of this problem has decreased due to the widespread use of centrifugal pump heads and technological advances in the equipment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112449036">12</xref></sup> Another issue of controversy is whether this technique is capable of producing significant changes that are beneficial for human physiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112449036">13</xref></sup> Specific animal experiments and clinical trials concerning nearly all organ systems have been conducted and most of the papers have reported that this technique yields advantages for organ systems. Regarding the endocrine system, pulsatile perfusion has been suggested to preserve the pituitary-adrenal axis function, maintain physiological levels of triiodothyronine and free triiodothyronine, and preserve the adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol response to trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112449036">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112449036">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112449036"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112449036">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Production of free oxygen radicals is increased and leads to oxidative stress in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112449036">14</xref></sup> The oxidative stress response is altered in patients during cardiac surgical operations. Increased oxidative stress during coronary reperfusion contributes to myocardial stunning. It has been shown that 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde, which are lipid peroxidation products indicating oxidative stress, are increased in the early reperfusion period of the heart. Pantke et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112449036">15</xref></sup> evaluated serum protein carbonyl levels in order to assess the accumulation of oxidative proteins during cardiovascular surgery. The authors reported that there was a 3-fold increase in protein carbonyl levels during the early reperfusion period and that the elevation in the protein carbonyl levels was stable for 4 hours. In their study evaluating the effects of on-pump and off-pump CABG techniques on oxidative stress and inflammation, Matata et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112449036">16</xref></sup> measured lipid hydroperoxides, protein carbonyl and nitrotyrosine levels to assess oxidative stress. Compared with the off-pump group, significant increases in lipid hydroperoxides, protein carbonyl and nitrotyrosine levels were noted in the on-pump group. In that particular study, it was shown that protein carbonyl levels were elevated 2.5 fold 1 hour after the initiation of CPB and dropped down to baseline values in the following hours. In the current study, we aimed to compare the respiratory and oxidative effects of the pulsatile and non-pulsatile CPB groups with the off-pump CABG group. To accomplish this aim, we separated the on-pump group into pulsatile CPB and non-pulsatile CPB. We concluded that off-pump CABG had less negative effects on the respiratory system and oxidative stress compared to the pulsatile and non-pulsatile CPB techniques. Additionally, the results of pulsatile and non-pulsatile CPB were similar.</p>
<p>Extracorporeal circulation influences the lungs through increasing the systemic inflammatory response. C3a and C5a formation, in conjunction with the prolongation of CPB and cross-clamp time, triggers the inflammatory process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112449036">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112449036">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112449036">7</xref></sup> Protein denaturation at the blood-gas interface is increased as the pump time is prolonged and this leads to the activation of the complement system. This results in the accumulation of activated neutrophils in the pulmonary circulation. Once in the pulmonary circulation, these neutrophils release enzymes, such as elastase and myeloperoxidase, and cause free oxygen radical formation that leads to various degrees of pulmonary damage. Consequently, the production and activity of alveolar surfactant is decreased, capillary permeability is increased, fluid extravasates into the interstitial space, and pulmonary edema develops. Following the formation of pulmonary interstitial edema, increased alveolar-arterial gradient, decreased static pulmonary compliance and increased airway resistance are observed following CPB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112449036">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112449036">18</xref></sup> Moreover, increased pulmonary vascular resistance is frequently observed after CPB. Several studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112449036">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659112449036">19</xref></sup> have shown that the increase in interstitial fluid observed following bypass leads to a reduction in pulmonary compliance, a reduction in tidal volume and a subsequent increase in the respiratory rate to maintain alveolar ventilation. Total pulmonary volume and all functional parameters are diminished. The most significant reduction occurs in functional residual capacity (FRC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659112449036">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Braun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112449036">17</xref></sup> reported significant reductions in all static lung volumes, diffusion capacity, and PaO<sub>2</sub> 2 weeks after coronary artery surgery. Berrizbeitia et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112449036">18</xref></sup> reported that there was a mean reduction of 30% to 50% in FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub> and FRC in the early postoperative period following coronary artery bypass surgery.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, a study simultaneously evaluating the effects of pulsatile and non-pulsatile classical pump techniques and an off-pump CABG technique on the respiratory system and oxidative stress does not exist in the literature.
