<p>Much recent social science literature on international migration gives the impression that the state is withering away, if it is not already dead. International migration, by definition, transgresses the very lines that demarcate states’ political-geographic boundaries, rendering them, and the states defined by them, ostensibly less meaningful as actors or even as relevant context in an age of globalization. Today, the theme of “transnationalism” is more predominant. A spate of recent studies emphasizes how crisscrossing flows of money, ideas, and, perhaps most importantly, people are weaving together new spaces: “trans”-national spaces that transcend the place-bound jurisdictional influences of national governments. Within these transnational spaces, migrants are emerging as key agents of development in both origins and destinations. From this view, the state is usually seen either as an obstacle to migrants’ efforts to promote development in origin sites or as irrelevant to these efforts, as an antiquated set of institutions less capable of engaging usefully with the character of twenty-first century migration.</p>
<p>Natasha Iskander’s erudite and insightful study revitalizes the role of the state in the complex relationship between migration and development. Using a variety of methods ranging from interviews and participant observation to archival research, and working across two contexts (Morocco and Mexico), Iskander uncovers a process vital to understanding how the state continues to shape the migration-development nexus: a process she calls “interpretive engagement.” Rather than viewing the state as a static institution, Iskander reveals it as a dynamic set of practices that serve as tentative responses to the challenges of emigration and development. These practices are formed, and evolve, over relatively long periods of time through rounds of engagement between migrants and states as both sides attempt to develop practical solutions to the problems they confront.</p>
<p>Iskander describes this engagement as interpretive because it focuses on the meanings migrants and states attach to their practices. As functional communications are established, migrants and states bring often-diverging meanings, and understandings, of migration and development into contact. Precisely because they often hold opposing perspectives, migrants and states must make explicit what hitherto had remained implicit: how each defines their needs, and how each understands their relationship. This ongoing interpretative engagement involved a mutual making and re-making of the meanings of migration, the role of the state, and development. As new meanings emerged, interpretation allowed both parties to imagine new and innovative practices. Older meanings and practices eroded, and state practices changed, however incrementally. Over time, this iterative process of interpretive engagement was the seedbed from which innovative policies linking migration to development emerged in Mexico and Morocco. Without sustained interpretive engagement from both migrants and states, the migration-for-development policies in Mexico and Morocco would not have been as successful. For it is through the very process of interpretive engagement that these policies were constructed.</p>
<p>The policies linking migration to development in Mexico and Morocco are today held up as exemplars of “best practice.” Yet Iskander reveals an irony: the origins of these policies were in states’ efforts to preserve and extend their power, not in any effort to explicitly link migration to development. The Moroccan and Mexican states initially viewed migration as yet another means to consolidate power at home. But as government officials engaged with migrants, new meanings of migration and development emerged, which generated new strategies to address particular issues facing migrants and states, strategies that initially were not foreseen by migrants or states. Thus, the “best practice” policies of Mexico and Morocco are the unintended consequences of a process of interpretive engagement between migrants and the states. Therefore, if efforts to apply Moroccan and Mexican policies in other contexts have had only mixed results, it is because it is not the policies that should be emulated, but the processes and practices through which the policies were developed that should be emulated.</p>
<p>In the end, Iskander argues forcefully for a conception of development not as an end goal or a finite measurable outcome, but as a process—a process of learning embedded in an ongoing interpretive engagement between migrants and states. From this perspective, migration-for-development policies appear less like failures or disappointments and more like catalysts for transformation, and as facilitators for future economic growth. Here, the question of whether migration promotes development is also re-framed. Instead of asking whether migration improves or reduces development at home, the question becomes one of whether, and if so how, migration opens up new opportunities to improve the lives of individuals and communities back home.</p>
<p>Development, however, is indeed both a process <italic>and</italic> an outcome; it is an iteratively produced bundle of contingent practices as Iskander reveals, but it is also unavoidably a condition, a state of being. At some point and preferably rather regularly, empirical assessments must be made of just how well, or not, the processes and practices linking migration to development are working to improve living standards and well-being at home. That is, processes and practices should be evaluated, in large part, on whether they produce the intended outcome, in this case, improvement in living standards and well-being. Empirical assessments of this sort require finite indicators of development as a condition. Focusing only on the process of development means avoiding the necessary but sometimes unpleasant task of assessing just how much migration affects people living back home.</p>
<p>Yet by emphasizing development as a process, Iskander has exposed the very processes and practices that have succeeded in linking migration to development in Mexico and Morocco. In doing so, she revives the state as a key actor in the relationship between migration and development, providing a welcome corrective to arguments that would prematurely write the obituary of the state. This is a careful and innovative comparative analysis that will occupy a central place in the ongoing debates over migration and development.</p>
