<p>This book being a book of “the basics” – as the series name suggests – Clayton tries not only to inform, but also to “talk” with the reader: he asks questions, starts discussions and gives advice for further readings. The author “speaks” with people because the book is primarily about people, despite the title: <italic>Religion and Science</italic>. The author knows that there is no such thing as “Religion,” only religions; neither is there any such thing as “Science,” just particular sciences. “Religion” and “Science” are not some entities confronting each other; there are only religious believers confronting what are sometimes called “scientific believers.” Furthermore, “Religion” and “Science” are human creations that cannot be understood outside of human existence. That Philip Clayton knows these aspects becomes clear in Chapter 3, where he presents some particular non-Christian religions (Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism); in Chapters 4–6 he discusses specific sciences (Physics, Biological sciences, and Neurosciences); and in Chapters 7 and 8 he goes even further, focusing on certain applications of scientific research and technology, some of them with deep moral implications (fertilization, euthanasia, warfare technology, etc.). </p>
<p>The book aims to show that both science and religion have human interests at their core and, when rightly understood, complement each other. In the environmental crisis, for example, “Religions are not in the position to predict the melting rate of the polar ice caps or to calculate how many meters the sea level will rise as a consequence … By contrast, scientists are, frankly, not particularly good at motivating ordinary citizens to change their lifestyles. Science can explain empirical relationships and causes, but reciting the facts often leaves people cold … Yet science’s weakness is precisely religion’s strength … Religious leaders know how to speak to ‘the whole person,’ how to motivate not just the head but also the emotions and the will” (165).</p>
<p>This book will appeal not only to a general readership, but also to religious and scientific leaders. As a result of his calling for a dialogue between “religion” and “science” (or vice versa), religious leaders and scientists will find much value in the topics covered by Philip Clayton. </p>
