<abstract>
<p>The World Wide Web, together with other ICT enabling technologies, offers a platform for organizations to arrange their business processes, address their marketplaces, and partner with other enterprises. This paper reports on the diffusion and adoption of electronic commerce tools by small and medium enterprise (SME) tourism service providers in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa. In order to achieve the stated aim, the following research questions were addressed: What types of e-commerce tools have been adopted in the SMEs? What were the reasons for the adoption of e-commerce? What benefits do e-commerce tools provide to SMEs? What are the barriers that SMEs face with the adoption of e-commerce? What are the e-commerce training needs of SMEs service providers? Roger’s Diffusion of Innovations framework was found to be useful as the study sought to examine the diffusion and use of modern ICTs by SME tourism service providers. The study adopted a descriptive survey research design in which a systematic sampling technique is used. The data was analysed by using descriptive statistics. The results demonstrated that a variety of e-commerce tools have been adopted in the SMEs studied. E-commerce tools are also very effective in reaching new customers, increasing sales and improving marketing. It is therefore important that SMEs have access to relevant e-commerce tools in order to enjoy and reap the benefits of ICTs. SMEs should ensure that they offer their staff adequate varieties and levels of ICT competence. </p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>South Africa is a popular tourist destination, with around 860,000 arrivals per month in 2008 of which about 210,000 were from outside the African continent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912452270">South Africa.info: 2012</xref>). In addition, revenue equalling between 1 percent and 3 percent of gross domestic product is generated by the tourism industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912452270">South Africa.info 2012</xref>). Among the main attractions are diverse and picturesque cultures, game reserves and highly regarded local wines. South Africa performed strongly in the 2007 World's Best Awards survey by the international travel magazine, <italic>Travel and Leisure</italic>, with nine establishments listed among the world's top 100 hotels. Cape Town was voted the 10th best holiday city in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912452270">South Africa.info 2012</xref>). It is important to note that tourism is vital for the development of South Africa and is at present the fourth largest industry after mining, agriculture and trade, employing an estimated 600,000 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912452270">South Africa.info 2012</xref>). It is also worth noting that South Africa has always been popular with international leisure travellers, but it is also fast becoming a preferred business tourism destination. Large international companies are eager to host international events, conferences and trade expositions in the country, and business travellers are as willing to attend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266666912452270">South Africa Yearbook 2010</xref>/11).</p>
<p>To many people, the term ‘electronic commerce’ means shopping on the Internet, also called the World Wide Web (Web). However, electronic commerce (e-commerce) also includes many other activities such as business trading with other businesses and internal processes that companies use to support buying, selling, hiring, planning and other activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266666912452270">Stansfield and Grant 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666912452270">Schneider 2010</xref>:04). Some people use the term ‘electronic business’ (e-business) when they refer to electronic commerce (EC) in this broader sense. Most people use the terms ‘electronic commerce’ and ‘electronic business’ interchangeably. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266666912452270">United Nations (2000)</xref> defines e-commerce as all forms of transaction relating to commercial activities of both organizations and individuals that are based the transaction and processing of digitized data including text, sound, and visual images.</p>
<p>In this article, the term ‘electronic commerce’ is used in its broadest sense and includes all business activities that use Internet technologies. Internet technologies include the Internet, the Web and other technologies such as wireless transmissions on mobile telephone networks. Companies that operate only online are often called dot-com or pure dot-com businesses to distinguish them from companies operating from physical locations (solely or together with online operations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266666912452270">Mbatha 2009</xref>). </p>
<p>There is no single agreed definition of a small and medium enterprise (SME). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666912452270">European Commission (2003</xref>:39), supported by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266666912452270">Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (2008</xref>:126) an enterprise is considered to be any entity engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form. This includes, in particular, self-employed persons and family businesses engaged in craft or other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666912452270">European Commission 2003</xref>:39). Also of note is that within the SME category, a small enterprise is defined as an enterprise which employs fewer than 50 persons and whose annual turnover and/or annual balance sheet total does not exceed EUR 10 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666912452270">European Commission 2003</xref>:39). For the purpose of this article, an SME is best described as a small business with a turnover of up to US$ 2 million.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912452270">Bhasker (2006</xref>:02), it is envisaged that the online needs of consumers are going to increase. This in turn will lead to the creation of many new products, as well as new business and services, accompanied by growing employment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912452270">Mann (2011</xref>:02) asserts that e-commerce and its growth have already emerged as a technological turning point, displaying a speedy impact that is unprecedented. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912452270">Bhasker (2006</xref>:02) opines that the term ‘e-commerce’ has been used to describe a variety of market transactions, enabled by information technology and conducted over the electronic network. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266666912452270">Warkentin (2003</xref>:05), supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266666912452270">Ramsay, Ibbotson, Bell and Gray (2003)</xref>, is of the view that the emergence of the Internet as a vast public network with millions of people connected online has given rise to a new interactive market-place for buying and selling. For some, e-commerce therefore simply means the ability to buy and sell goods, and to access information and services online through public networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666912452270">Moodley 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912452270">Bhasker 2006</xref>:02). It is important to note that the phenomenal growth of e-commerce can be attributed to the reduction of friction in business transactions over the network. This reduction has led to improvements in the quality of service, customer care, lower costs to the consumer and faster execution of transactions, including instantaneous delivery of goods in some cases (e.g. software, digital music). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912452270">Bhasker (2006</xref>:07) argues that in order to achieve this, e-commerce is concerned with systems and business processes that support the following: </p>

<p>creation of information sources</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<p>Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have proved to be formidable tools to better address the various development issues in a rapid and cost-effective manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266666912452270">Mbatha and Ocholla 2011</xref>). In his study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266666912452270">Zongo (2001</xref>:4), supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666912452270">Lopez-Sisniega (2009)</xref>, argues that ICTs also serve as a basis to create new jobs and wealth, all of these leading to sustainable development. In supporting the aforementioned views, Ajayi (2002:2), supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266666912452270">Mbatha, Ocholla and Le Roux (2011</xref>:251), asserts that ICTs now play a major role in enterprise development, education, health, agriculture and commerce. As a result, the potential of ICTs to transform development is now receiving greater attention worldwide. ICTs enable people and enterprises to capture economic opportunities by increasing process efficiency, promoting participation in expanded economic networks, and creating opportunities for employment. In addition, they provide access to practical information on SME business accounting, market opportunities, financial services and products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666912452270">Markle Foundation 2009</xref>). In Chile, for example, an Internet network among farmer organizations has dramatically increased farmers' incomes by providing information about crop status, weather, global market prices and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666912452270">Markle Foundation 2009</xref>). ICTs also provide opportunities to access finance. The financial and information service network offers opportunities for local people and small enterprises that previously had no access to flexible financing.</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out that the Internet has created the ability for businesses to streamline processes and made those processes more efficient, driven competition and increased productivity. Efficiency and increased productivity are factors that can improve SME operations, regardless of whether or not a particular business' market focus is local or international. At the very least, the Internet provides SMEs with the ability to market their goods and services, provide consumers with timely information, and an additional means of guiding consumers to their doors. The Internet also allows SMEs to manage their finances and expenses online through business-to-business portals where distributors compete for the best price. ICTs facilitate global connectivity, resulting in new ways of creating and delivering products and services on a global scale. New business models and market configurations enabled by ICTs, including business process outsourcing and disintermediation, provide SMEs with access to new markets and new sources of competitive advantage from which to drive income growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912452270">Bhasker 2006</xref>:02; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666912452270">Schneider 2010</xref>:04; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912452270">Mann 2011</xref>:02).</p>

<sec id="section4-0266666912452270">
<title>Benefits of e-commerce</title>
<p>There are many benefits to both a business and that business’s customers for implementing an e-commerce strategy. Most of these benefits centre on convenience and efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266666912452270">Morley and Parker 2009</xref>, 464). One of the benefits of e-commerce adoption is that an SME can overcome geographical limitations. For example, a physical store is limited by the geographical area that it can service. However, with an e-commerce website, the whole world becomes accessible. Also of note is that e-commerce can eliminate travel time and cost. It is not unusual for customers to travel long distances to reach their preferred physical store. With e-commerce, customers can visit the same store virtually, with a few mouse clicks. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666912452270">Thanasankit (2002</xref>: 200), one great benefit of e-commerce is that it lowers the cost of information delivery and transfer. For example, there are no expensive brochures, so publishing and postage costs are reduced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666912452270">Thanasankit (2002</xref>, 200) further opines that Internet technology can be used as a marketing tool. It is an inexpensive way of providing catalogues, and new products and services can be immediately advertised on the Internet. Customers can access business content provided on the Web instantly, an unlimited number of times, any time – day or night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666912452270">Thanasankit 2002</xref>: 200). </p>
<p>The Internet is available globally and distributes information to anyone connected to it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912452270">Bhasker (2006</xref>:02), supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266666912452270">Mbatha, Ocholla, and Le Roux (2011)</xref>, is of the opinion that the global access offered by the Internet to anyone who is connected, expands the market reach of a company beyond its geographic location, as anyone at every corner of the globe can transact business with the company by means of this network. In support of these views, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666912452270">Schneider (2010</xref>:04) opines that all companies that offer products and services are on equal footing, irrespective of their size. </p>
<p>Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912452270">Mann (2011</xref>:02) is of the view that the global market reach opens up new markets, but on the other hand it brings competitive pressure from those who have already set up their e-commerce presence, leaving no-one unaffected. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912452270">Mann (2011)</xref> further opines that customers’ requirements and needs can be addressed quickly and efficiently by using the Internet. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912452270">Mann (2011)</xref> further contends that taking an order via the Internet may cause a company to believe that it is in e-commerce, but true e-business is more than merely setting up a website and allowing customers to order products and services via the Internet. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266666912452270">Lucas (2003</xref>:07) also argues that the real advantage of e-business results from becoming a fully integrated electronic firm, integrating the Internet through all aspects of the firm’s value chain. For a manufacturing company, being an e-business means that customers query a website for product availability and delivery schedules; behind the website supply chain, management software consults online inventory files and a production planning system to return a promised shipping date to the customer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266666912452270">Lucas 2003</xref>:07). </p>

<title>Tourism in Pretoria</title>
<p>The province of Gauteng, popularly known as the ‘Place of Gold’, is the economic powerhouse of South Africa. It is characterized by a cosmopolitan, multicultural mix of people from all walks of life. The province’s unique cultural and social legacy is evident from its many excellent museums, theatres, cultural precincts and craft markets. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266666912452270">South Africa Yearbook (2010</xref>/11), Gauteng Province is the most visited province on day trips in South Africa. It may be the most populated, built-up and industrialized province, but it still boasts some great day walks for visitors. Pretoria is located in the north of the Gauteng Province. It is one of the country's three capital cities, serving as the executive (administrative) and de facto national capital. Pretoria is sometimes referred to as ‘Tshwane’ due to a long-running and controversial proposed change of name, which has yet to be decided as of 2012. A variety of historical buildings can be found in the city, also known as the ‘Jacaranda City’ because of the many jacaranda trees lining its streets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266666912452270">South Africa Yearbook 2010</xref>/11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912452270">South Africa.info 2012</xref>). </p>
<p>Church Square is built around a statue of Paul Kruger, president of the former Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, and consists of buildings such as the Old Raadsaal and the Palace of Justice. Ten minutes’ drive from Church Square is Freedom Park, which commemorates the country’s political history. Once fully completed, the 35 hectare site will comprise a garden of remembrance, a museum, and statues and sculptures to honour South Africans who have contributed to the country’s freedom and development. The Kruger House Museum contains the personal belongings of President Kruger. Melrose House is a beautiful example of Victorian architecture. The Peace Treaty of Vereeniging, which ended the Anglo Boer/South African War, was signed there in 1902. Demonstrations at the Pioneer Open-Air Museum include cow milking, butter- and candle-making, bread baking and coffee-bean grinding. Other museums include the Police Museum, the Coert Steynberg Museum and the Transvaal Museum of Natural History. The Voortrekker Monument also has a museum and commemorates the Great Trek. Some 260 steps lead to the dome, where spectacular views of the city can be enjoyed. The Monument receives about 200,000 visitors a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266666912452270">South Africa Yearbook 2010</xref>/11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912452270">South Africa.info 2012</xref>). </p>
<p>Fort Schanskop has been refurbished and has a 375-seat amphitheatre. The Union Buildings were designed by Sir Herbert Baker and completed in 1913, and were the setting for the presidential inauguration of Dr Mandela in 1994, of Thabo Mbeki on 16 June 1999 and 27 April 2004, and of Jacob Zuma on 9 May 2009. The Sammy Marks Museum near Pretoria dates from 1885. Rooms in the house are filled with Victorian paintings, furniture, silver and porcelain. Visitors can relax in the tea garden and restaurant on the premises. The Rietvlei Nature Reserve is notable for its grass types, herbs, large number of game and many bird species. The Willem Prinsloo Agricultural Museum outside Pretoria features a farmstead dating from 1880. The Pretoria National Botanical Garden houses the National Herbarium of South Africa, the largest in the southern hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266666912452270">South Africa Yearbook 2010</xref>/11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912452270">South Africa.info 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>Roger’s Diffusion of Innovations theory was found useful, as the study sought to examine the diffusion and use of modern ICTs by SME service providers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666912452270">Clarke (1999)</xref> notes that Roger’s theory has been used as the theoretical basis for a number of information systems projects. The theory has also been widely applied to investigate the diffusion of organizational and societal innovations. Thus, the theory’s application to information technology and organizational and societal relations provides the most appropriate framework for this paper. The Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DoI) is one of the theories that explain the acceptance of technology. In his comprehensive book, <italic>Diffusion of Innovation</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266666912452270">Roger (1995)</xref> defines diffusion as the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. Roger's definition contains four elements that are present in the diffusion of innovation process, namely innovation, communication channels, time, and the social system.</p>
<p>In order to understand the definition of DoI, one needs to first understand some key terms. The diffusion of an innovation concerns "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system" (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266666912452270">Rogers 1995</xref>). The DoI is essentially a social process in which subjectively perceived information about a new idea is communicated and rests on the premise that a new idea, practice or object has perceivable channels, time and mode of being adopted by individuals or organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266666912452270">Rogers 1983</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666912452270">Clarke (1999</xref>:1) argues that the theory purports to describe the patterns of adoption, explains the mechanisms, and assists in predicting whether and how a new innovation will be successful. Clarke sums it up by pointing out that the theory is concerned with the manner in which a new technological idea, artefact or technique, or a new use of an old one, migrates from creation to use. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266666912452270">Rogers (2003)</xref> argues that those innovations which are perceived by individuals as having greater relative advantage, compatibility, trialability and observability will be adopted more rapidly than those which are perceived as more complex. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266666912452270">Rogers (1995)</xref> proposed a model of the innovation-decision adoption process that emphasizes the role of individual behaviour in the technology adoption process. It is worth mentioning that the model relates to actions and choices during which an individual evaluates a new innovation and decides whether or not to incorporate it into an ongoing practice.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>A survey research design was used to conduct this study. The study target was South African urban tourism SME service providers located in Pretoria in Gauteng Province. This city was chosen for its diverse tourism business activities that include bed-and-breakfast establishments, hotels, travel agencies and transport, to name a few. The sampling frame consisted of 350 tourism SME service providers registered at the Gauteng Tourism Authority. The sample size consisted of 210 SMEs, selected through systematic sampling. However, those who filled and returned questionnaires were 197 (94 percent). An initial starting point was selected randomly, and every second SME from a list was selected thereafter. This sampling technique also helped to prevent bias in the selection process. The enterprises sampled included: bed-and-breakfast establishments 112 (53 percent); guest houses 57 (27 percent); and tour operators 41 (20 percent). </p>
<p>The self-administered questionnaire consisted of both structured and non-structured questions and allowed the respondents to answer the questions without any pressure. The instrument sought information about enterprise and personal characteristics of the operators; types of e-commerce tools available in respondents’ SMEs; the reasons for adopting e-commerce tools; the benefits of e-commerce adoption; barriers to e-commerce adoption and training needs of SME service providers. Empirical data was analysed by using frequencies and descriptive statistics. Also, for purposes of analysis, items in the research instrument were measured using the Likert scale of 1 to 5. The questionnaire was pre-tested for clarity, completeness, relevance and shortcomings in two SMEs that were not included in the main study. The aim of the pilot was to establish the questionnaire’s effectiveness, reliability and validity before the actual study. Most importantly, the pilot survey aimed to test the subject matter of the current research, the population it was to cover, its spatial variability, and the possible reactions to questions by the respondents. The reliability of the research instrument was enhanced by having both close ended and open-ended questions. The researcher ensured that simple, direct and unbiased wording was used. In terms of ethical considerations, informed consent was obtained from each participant in the study in order to ensure that they understood what they were doing and verify their willingness to participate. The respondents were assured of their rights, including the right of consent, protection from disclosure of information, and respect for their privacy. </p>
<p>All the research participants participated voluntarily, and were not forced to take part in the study. With regard to protection from harm, the researcher ensured that the participants were not at any risk and would not be exposed to embarrassment, unusual stress, or any demeaning treatment. Anonymity and confidentiality were promised and maintained. The information they provided was not made available to anyone else who was not directly involved in the study and cannot be traced/ identified to the participants. The researcher also ensured that the participants would remain anonymous throughout the study. In terms of professional standards, the researcher ensured that the results were gathered in a professional manner without misrepresenting anyone and/or intentionally misleading the respondents about the nature of the study. The researcher ensured that all the results were presented honestly without fabricating any data to support any particular finding/ result. The researcher also adhered to the institutional guidelines. </p>

<p>The table depicts that the majority of respondents had less than 10 employees, while 72 percent had been in business for over 10 years. The study was male dominated and the majority of the SMEs dealt with local and/or regional customers. The survey established that a significant number of the SMEs were part of some form of strategic alliance, with 17 percent being sole proprietors. With regard to the respondents' age, the biggest group were those aged between 31 and 40. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266666912452270">Table 1</xref> further demonstrates that the majority of the service providers hold diplomas as their highest academic qualification. </p>
<p>These results concur with a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666912452270">Ayoo (2001)</xref> where he established that most professionals above the age of 40 years in developing countries, among which we include South Africa. Ayoo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666912452270">2001</xref>) further argues that developing countries are often conservative and slow in keeping pace with ICT advancements. It was considered vital to assess gender proportionality in the present study, as it is a widely held view that males dominate the use of and access to ICTs. Earlier studies have identified women and girls as disadvantaged in their uptake of ICTs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266666912452270">Ngenge 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266666912452270">Minishi-Majanja and Kiplang’at (2003</xref>:70) have suggested that gender disparity among professionals in Africa can be attributed partly to the educational system and partly to factors inherent in society at large. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266666912452270">Shaw and Gant (2002</xref>:517) argue that it has been empirically proven that women and men differ in their attitudes towards, comfort with, and anxiety about computer technology. The results of the study reported on here indicate that there was clear male dominance in the sample population; whether this was the case with regard to ICT usage is unknown. </p>

<sec id="section10-0266666912452270">
<title>Diffusion of e-commerce tools</title>
<p>One of the objectives of this study was to establish the types of e-commerce tools available to the tourism SMEs studied. The respondents were provided with a list of e-commerce tools and were asked to rate them accordingly using a binary choice of 1 (not accessible) and 2 (accessible), as was applicable to their situations. The respondents were asked to add any other applicable e-commerce tools that were not listed on the questionnaire.</p>
<p>It was important for this study to determine the extent to which the various types of business were using different kinds of ICTs. To be able to improve work productivity and creativity, deliver services fast and efficiently, and be more competitive, SME service providers need to have complete access to relevant technology. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266666912452270">Table 2</xref> depicts that all the respondents indicated that fax machines, computers, Internet, mobile phones, telephones and electronic mail were available in their respective SMEs. These results tempt one to declare that in the SMEs studied, e-commerce tools are intensively used. The availability of these ICT tools could be attributed to the fact that all the targeted SMEs were based in an urban area, which is also a capital city of South Africa, and that this city has a sound telecommunication infrastructure. Also, the availability of these ICTs could be attributed to the fact that the respondents were aware of their benefits and importance. Interpreted in the light of the diffusion of innovations theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266666912452270">Rogers 1995</xref>:5), the results suggest that the ICTs indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266666912452270">Table 2</xref> were perceived by SME service providers to have more relative advantage and were more compatible with their existing values, past experiences and needs, and were thus adopted. </p>

<p>The Internet is one of the most important ICT tools an SME can adopt to improve its competitiveness and work productivity. For example, in support of the results above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666912452270">Schneider (2010</xref>:04) reports that because millions of people use the Internet to search for products and services, SMEs can penetrate other markets at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing methods. In his recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912452270">Mann (2011</xref>:02) is of the view that websites act as virtual storefronts, allowing businesses to stay open 24/7. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912452270">Mann (2011</xref>:02) reports that Internet promotion provides a business with greater visibility, thereby creating more opportunities to increase its customers at relatively low cost. An effective website that entertains and contains the information needed for buying decisions quickly enhances an organizations’ image and public recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666912452270">Thanasankit 2002</xref>:200).</p>
<p>It has never been easier for a start-up business to reach out to literally millions of potential customers and to position itself for success, without the need for costly infrastructure and overwhelming marketing costs. It is also true that by means of the Internet, new businesses can become popular almost overnight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666912452270">Schneider 2010</xref>:4). Also, the results reveal that all the respondents were using email in their SMEs. This did not come as a surprise, given the fact that email results in instant business communications, whether the customer or business affiliate is across the street or on the other side of the globe. It therefore enables customers to maintain contact and readily facilitates repeat purchasing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266666912452270">Rogers (2003)</xref> argues that those innovations which individuals perceive as having greater relative advantage, compatibility, trialability and observability will be adopted more rapidly than those which are perceived as more complex. It can therefore be concluded that the reason why those e-commerce tools have been adopted by the SMEs is simply because they have greater relative advantage and are not complex. </p>

<sec id="section11-0266666912452270">
<title>Reasons for e-commerce adoption</title>
<p>Respondents were requested to give their personal responses to a close-ended question regarding the adoption of e-commerce tools in their respective SMEs.

<p>The table depicts that a significant number of the SME service providers in the study adopted e-commerce in order to reach new customers. In support of these results, Rob and Coronel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266666912452270">2009</xref>:232) report that the Internet environment makes it relatively easy to compile and track customer information. They are of the view that businesses can create extensive customer profiles that include purchasing preferences, demographic and geographic information, online behaviour, and personal preferences. Such information can be used to design websites that attract more users, target specific markets, and display features customized to individual interests. These results are in line with the study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912452270">Migiro and Ocholla (2005)</xref> on the use of e-commerce tools in tourism SMEs in KwaZulu-Natal province, where they established that one of the main reasons why SMEs adopt e-commerce tools was to reach new customers. An earlier study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666912452270">Thanasankit (2002</xref>:200) established that the Internet lowers the cost of market research. Thus, potential or target customers can be reached in both local and international markets. </p>
<p>The results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266666912452270">Table 3</xref> further demonstrate that reduction of costs was another reason for e-commerce adoption by the SMEs under investigation. These results are in parallel with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666912452270">Thanasankit (2002</xref>:200) and Lin and Huang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666912452270">2012</xref>:86), who argue that SMEs can gain fundamental benefits from e-commerce in terms of reduction of costs for office establishment and operating costs (e.g. personnel and equipment). These authors caution that the cost of setting up a full-service e-commerce website is quite similar to that of opening a single physical storefront, but can reach more customers. </p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266666912452270">Table 3</xref> also depicts that the desire to increase sales was also a reason for e-commerce adoption amongst SMEs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912452270">Migiro and Ocholla (2005)</xref> and Lin and Huang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666912452270">2012</xref>:86) opine that one of the greatest benefits of e-commerce is that it remains open all the time, making it more convenient for customers. From the merchant's point of view, this can increase the number of orders they receive. Conversely, from the customer's point of view, an ‘always open’ store is more convenient. An e-commerce strategy can improve the creation of markets for niche products. Buyers and sellers of niche products can find it difficult to locate each other in the physical world. Online, it is only a matter of the customer searching for the product on a search engine. Competition in business always pushes businesses to design new strategies and mechanisms to do business differently and more effectively. However, the results show that pressure emanating from competition was not one of the reasons most SMEs in this study adopted e-commerce. Intense competition and the advent of information technology have stimulated the SMEs to invest in and integrate technological infrastructure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666912452270">Drew (2003)</xref> argues that because millions of businesses are selling the same product and services, competing with more established businesses can be frustrating and costly for small businesses. Likewise, larger companies can offer promotions, pay for directory inclusions and implement pay-per-click campaigns as well as employ the ‘Who is Who’ in Internet marketing to develop campaigns that generate traffic and leads. </p>

<sec id="section12-0266666912452270">
<title>Benefits of e-commerce</title>
<p>One of the objectives of the study was to establish the benefits of e-commerce in all the targeted SMEs. Respondents were provided with a list of the benefits of e-commerce tools and asked to rate each one on a scale of 1 to 5 depending on how applicable it was to their situation (1 = not at all applicable; 2= slightly applicable; 3= neutral; 4 = applicable; and 5 = very applicable). The respondents were also asked to add any other e-commerce benefits that were not listed on the questionnaire.</p>
<p>It is clear from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266666912452270">Table 4</xref> that the majority of respondents were of the view that e-commerce enables them to interact with customers. In line with these results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666912452270">Thanasankit (2002</xref>:124) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912452270">Mann (2011</xref>:414) assert that an e-commerce strategy can easily create targeted communication. For example, by using the information that a customer provides on the registration form, and by placing cookies on the customer's computer, an e-commerce merchant can access a lot of information about its customers. This, in turn, can be used to communicate relevant messages. </p>

<p>The results also show that the respondents felt that e-commerce enables SMEs to reach new customers. Migiro and Ocholla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912452270">2005</xref>) and Bragg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266666912452270">2011</xref>)argue that e-commerce has proved to be more effective with regard to gaining new customers with search-engine visibility. Physical retail is driven by branding and relationships. In addition to these two drivers, online retail is also driven by traffic from search engines (Bragg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266666912452270">2011</xref>). Bragg further contends that it is not unusual for customers to follow a link in search engine results, and land on an e-commerce website they have never heard of. Clearly, this additional source of traffic can be the tipping point for some e-commerce businesses. For an organization to be successful, it has to be competitive. This is also evident in the results of this study, where a significant number of the respondents also indicated that e-commerce enables them to be more competitive. It should be noted that with e-commerce customers are able to locate a product more quickly. On an e-commerce website, customers can click through intuitive navigation or use a search box to immediately narrow down their product search. Some websites remember customer preferences and shopping lists to facilitate repeat purchases. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266666912452270">Table 4</xref> also depicts that a significant number of the respondents were of the view that e-commerce is more beneficial with regard to improving their marketing strategies. This could be attributed to the fact that e-commerce provides for comparison shopping. There are several online services that allow customers to browse multiple e-commerce merchants and find the best prices.</p>
<p>Improved quality of information was reported by a significant number of the respondents as one of the benefits of e-commerce in their respective SMEs. This could be attributed to the fact that an e-commerce strategy provides customers with abundant information they may require in their decision-making process with regard to online shopping. It is true that there are limitations to the amount of information that can be displayed in a physical store. It is difficult to equip employees to respond to customers who require information across product lines. E-commerce websites can make additional information easily available to customers. Most of this information is provided by vendors, and does not cost anything to create or maintain. Increased sales and increased internal efficiency are some of the benefits of e-commerce in an organization. This was also established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912452270">Migiro and Ocholla (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666912452270">Schneider (2010</xref>: 4) who maintain that one of the greatest benefits of adopting e-commerce tools in a business is communication with the customer base, and also to increase sales. However, the results of this study depict that an average number of respondents were of the view that increased sales and increased internal efficiency were not among the benefits they were reaping from e-commerce in their SMEs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666912452270">Drew (2003)</xref> opines that with adequate information, small businesses can benefit significantly from Internet promotion while minimizing its disadvantages. In fact, it may prove to be the marketing strategy that generates the highest return on investment.</p>

<p>When asked to indicate the challenges that impede their e-commerce adoption, the majority of respondents revealed that lack of trust in e-commerce strategy was one of the barriers. Bragg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266666912452270">2011</xref>:244) reports that when a business contemplates adding web interfaces to its mission-critical systems, significant security questions often arise. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266666912452270">Bragg (2011</xref>:244) further states that the best approach to security is to implement a range of security features designed to protect sensitive data and the system from the constant barrage of attacks on the internet. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266666912452270">Hoffman, Novak and Peralta (1999</xref>:82) argue that trust is perhaps the most important influence on information disclosure. Certainly, several studies of interpersonal exchange situations have confirmed that trust is a precondition for self-disclosure because it reduces the perceived risks involved in revealing private information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266666912452270">Steel 1991</xref>:1319; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912452270">Langlauf 2011</xref>). Lack of privacy was also reported to be one of the barriers for e-commerce adoption by SMEs. The aforementioned results concur with studies conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266666912452270">Metzger (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666912452270">Lopez-Sisniega (2009)</xref> who report that concerns about privacy make many consumers reluctant to provide information while online. </p>
<p>A significant number of respondents further reported that the high cost of e-commerce strategy was one of the barriers to the adoption of e-commerce. These results tie in well with the study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912452270">Migiro and Ocholla (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666912452270">Kshetri (2007)</xref> who established that one of the barriers that impede the effective and adequate adoption of e-commerce by SMEs was high costs and limited funds. Generally, some organizations have unfair expectations that all their staff can use ICTs effectively. In many organizations, employees are provided with their own organizational ICTs to use in order to improve work productivity and creativity. However, some organizations do this without equipping their employees with the relevant skills to use ICTs more effectively. This is also evident in the results above, namely that the lack of necessary skills to use ICTs was reported by an average number of the respondents as one of the barriers that prohibit them from using e-commerce. These results are in line with the study done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912452270">Langnau (2011)</xref> who argues that another barrier that SMEs often overlook is the acquisition of relevant skills to effectively use e-commerce tools. New processes and procedures mean employees have to learn to use the new systems as well as changing their “we’ve always done it this way” thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912452270">Langnau 2011</xref>). One of the barriers to e-commerce adoption by many organizations is that e-commerce does not fit their products and the way they do business. The results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266666912452270">Table 5</xref>, however, demonstrate that, to the contrary, this was not the case at all targeted SMEs, which means that their products and services fit their e-commerce strategy well. </p>

<title>Training needs of SME service providers</title>
<p>The respondents were asked to indicate the types of training they would require to assist them to use or operate e-commerce tools more often and more effectively. The respondents were therefore provided with a list of possible training needs and were asked to rate each one on the Likert scale of 1 to 5 depending on how applicable it was to their situation (1 = not at all applicable; 2= slightly applicable; 3 = neutral; 4 = applicable; and 5 = very applicable). Furthermore, the respondents were asked to add any other applicable training need that was not listed on the questionnaire.</p>
<p>In order to be able to use any technology effectively, a person must be well equipped with the skills essential for using that technology. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0266666912452270">Table 6</xref>, SME service providers indicated different areas of training they required in order to help them use e-commerce tools more often and more effectively. A significant number of respondents indicated that they required training in how to design websites and in information security. The results further show that a significant number of respondents needed training in information retrieval. This could be attributed to well-known reasons such as the fact that e-commerce is conducted on the Web, and therefore the respondents knew that in order to reap the benefits of e-commerce, they need to have the necessary skills to able to build websites or at least to maintain them. </p>

<p>The importance of information security cannot be over-emphasized. The main reason why many enterprises opt not to go online is due to fear that their information may be stolen or that their websites may be hacked. Information literacy is also key with regard to e-commerce; if one possesses information literacy skills, one is able to determine whether information is useful or not, and be able to synthesize that information. The results of the survey further indicate that training in the use of computers, email, cellphone banking, word processing, telephonic systems, and fax machines was not felt to be necessary. This could be attributed to the fact that most of the SME service providers used such tools on a daily basis. </p>
<p>Word processing is one of the well-known and widely used computer tools in many organizations. Therefore it was no surprise at all that a significant number of the respondents did not require training in this aspect. Moreover, the results show that the majority of respondents were well equipped in the use of cellphone banking. Again, these results came as no surprise due to the fact that South Africa is the fourth-fastest growing mobile communications market in the world. The statistics show that South Africa’s telecom sector boasts the continent’s most advanced networks in terms of the technology deployed and services provided (Paul Budded Communication 2010). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912452270">Bhasker (2006</xref>:02) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912452270">Mann (2011</xref>:02) opine that the owner’s computer literacy and technical knowledge on the use of e-commerce technology will quicken the e-commerce adoption process.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The focus of this article was to examine the diffusion and adoption of e-commerce tools by South African SME tourism service providers in Pretoria. E-commerce is one of the most important facets of the Internet to have emerged in recent times. Modern technology is vastly innovative and beneficial to those who know how to manipulate it. What is immediately clear from the results of this study is that a variety of e-commerce tools have been adopted by the SMEs under investigation with the intention to reach new customers and reduce costs, and a desire to increase change. Intense competition and the advent of information technology have stimulated the SMEs to invest in and integrate technological infrastructure. However, the results show that pressure emanating from competition was not one of the reasons most SMEs adopted e-commerce. With regard to the benefits of an e-commerce strategy, the survey established that e-commerce enables SMEs to interact with customers, reach new customers, improve competitiveness, and improve quality of information. </p>
<p>One of the most tangible positives of e-commerce is lower costs. A part of these lowered costs can be passed on to customers in the form of discounted prices. The availability of different types of e-commerce tools in all targeted SMEs may be a good indication of the intensive use of e-commerce tools. In order for SMEs to be effective in the Information Age, they need to have access to relevant e-commerce tools. </p>
<p>What is also clear from the results of this study is that there are formidable barriers to the use of e-commerce tools by the SME service providers studied, such as lack of trust in e-commerce, lack of privacy, high cost of e-commerce strategy, and lack of necessary skills to use e-commerce. In order to be able to use any technology effectively, a person must be well equipped with the skills essential to using that technology. SMEs require training on the design of websites and information security. Overcoming these barriers is a major challenge for policy makers and SMEs alike. Charting the shifting nature of these barriers is a significant task for policy analysts. A lack of ICT skills amongst SME service providers may be attributed to the unavailability of strategic planning for the long-term development of businesses. The implementation of e-commerce requires proper planning and an ICT policy to promote the use of ICTs within an SME. Adequate planning is crucial as embarking on any new innovation requires adequate planning. Adequate and proper planning usually result in success. Institutions that fail to plan before embarking on a particular programme usually end in a deadlock. In other words, “failure to plan is to plan to fail” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266666912452270">Tella 2007</xref>). Despite these barriers, the benefits are worthwhile. </p>
<p>The South African government is currently implementing an ICT policy that will, amongst others, address issues regarding critical skills shortage in South Africa. It is hoped that once the ICT policy is promulgated, it will address issues with regard to the skills shortage that have been raised in this article. The importance of education in support of any national development and ICT agenda cannot be over-emphasized. A sustainable ICT programme that contributes significantly to a country’s development can be achieved if the workforce is suitably trained and the educational system is able to continually supply skilled, innovative and entrepreneurial professionals. Benefits from e-commerce are contingent upon the completion of telecommunication infrastructure, confidence in the security of the system and acceptance by customers. Therefore, SMEs wishing to implement this technology need to extend infrastructure, improve the skills of their personnel and strengthen their security systems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0266666912452270">
<title>Recommendations for further study</title>
<p>Due to the little time that was available to complete this study, the survey targeted only SME tourism service providers in Pretoria. In order to obtain more extensive results, the study should be extended to cover more business establishments across major cities in South Africa. The design and implementation of a national framework would be beneficial to the growth of e-commerce in South Africa. This framework can be successful if it aims to solve the previously mentioned issues, with particular reference to ICT infrastructure and e-education. </p>
<p>Future research should examine ways in which companies can communicate the security of their websites to potential customers. Such website features as the use of secure servers or trusted third-party privacy seals could be explored for their effectiveness in promoting feelings of security and truthful information disclosure among online consumers. Site-navigation features and aesthetics could also be examined regarding their impact on perceived trustworthiness of and disclosure to commercial websites. The results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266666912452270">Table 5</xref> also suggest that more research is needed on the effects of company reputation on online trust and information disclosure. Future research on issues of online trust and information disclosure is indeed needed, as this study had some limitations.</p>
