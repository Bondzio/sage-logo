<abstract>
<p>The use of force–time curves in rheumatoid hands was investigated to assess peak force, average force, total grip time, area under the curve, and variability of the plateau region of the curves to identify the impact of different rheumatoid hand deformities on grip strength. We studied 43 patients — 10 men and 33 women — with established rheumatoid arthritis affecting their hands. Mean age was 61 years and mean duration of hand involvement was 13 years. Of the 86 hands, 38 had no finger deformity, eight had metacarpophalangeal joint ulnar deviation without any additional finger deformities, 16 had swan neck deformities, and 10 had boutonnière deformities. Fourteen hands had a combination of deformities. The hands with combined deformities were the weakest, had poor grip strength (34.7 N, SE 8), and were able to sustain grip for only a short time (22 sec, SE 3). Swan neck deformity also profoundly affects the magnitude (49.8 N, SE 7) and sustainability of grip (15 sec, SE 2). Even when only one finger had a swan neck deformity the mean strength was poor at 45 N. Swan neck deformity causes greater loss of strength than boutonnière deformity (82.7 N, SE 15). The strongest rheumatoid hands were those with only ulnar deviation deformities (90.8 N, SE 14). The area under the curve best predicted disability assessed using the Patient Evaluation Measure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Grip strength is a composite measure of hand impairment and is influenced by dysfunction of muscles, tendons, nerves, and the skeleton of the hand and wrist, as well as local or proximal pain. Despite the development of indices designed to assess the function of the hand affected by rheumatoid disease, grip strength assessment remains the cornerstone of most longitudinal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412439169">Duym and Pfurtscheller, 1984</xref>). Grip strength is traditionally measured as the maximum force that can be generated by the hand, and this is used to assess the degree of impairment of the hand in rheumatoid arthritis. Measuring only the peak force misses other attributes of hand strength, as it does not assess the speed of generation of strength, or sustainability or variability of grip strength.</p>
<p>Force–time curves have been used to measure strength, assess sincerity of effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412439169">Smith et al., 1989</xref>), and discriminate between sincere effort and faked weakness. We explored whether the force–time curve gave more information about grip in the rheumatoid hand. We studied force–time curves in rheumatoid hands and assessed peak force, average force, total grip time, area under the curve, and variability of the plateau region of the curves to understand the impact of different rheumatoid hand deformities on grip strength.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753193412439169" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We included 43 consenting patients who had established rheumatoid arthritis (disease duration &gt; 3 years) affecting the hand. No patient had had surgery. Mean age was 61 (range 29–79, SD 8) years and mean duration of hand involvement was 13 (range 1–47, SD 6) years. Ten were men and eight were left-handed. The duration of disease and duration of hand involvement were also recorded. We have previously reported on these patients in our study on working space in the rheumatoid hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412439169">Dias et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we investigated grip strength using force–time curves in further detail.</p>
<p>In 86 hands, the presence of the predominant type of finger deformity, such as a swan neck or boutonnière deformity or ulnar deviation at the metacarpophalangeal joint, was recorded. Each patient was categorized into one of five groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412439169">Table 1</xref>), depending on the deformity and ordered based on the working space of the hand, as described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412439169">Dias et al., 2009</xref>). There was no deformity in 38 hands (19 patients). Eight hands (4 patients, 20 fingers) had ulnar deviation of fingers without additional finger deformities, 16 hands (8 patients, 29 fingers) had multiple or single swan neck finger deformity, and 10 hands (5 patients, 27 fingers) had a boutonnière deformity. Fourteen hands (7 patients, 50 fingers) had a combination of deformities. Patients with wrist deformity were included in the combined group, but none had had surgery on the wrist when investigated and the wrist joint deformity was not considered.</p>

<p>This table has been previously presented in our study on working space and rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412439169">Dias et al., 2009</xref>), but the pattern of deformity distribution was different from this study. Grip strength data were available in 43 of 54 patients presented in the previous study.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Symptoms and disability were assessed using two questionnaires. The Patient Evaluation Measure (PEM) is a validated hand outcome questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412439169">Dias et al., 2001</xref>) that uses seven interval answers to a set of questions. The responses are used to generate a percentage score with 0 representing a normal hand. The second questionnaire, the Functional Disability Score (FDS), was developed specifically to assess rheumatoid hand function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412439169">Badley et al., 1984</xref>). The FDS scale is a questionnaire completed by the practitioner on the patient’s answers to 18 questions about daily living activities; each question was scored from 0 (performed without difficulty) to 5 (impossible to do). Disability was recorded as the total score obtained by adding the scores of all responses (range 0–90).</p>
<p>Measuring grip strength in the presence of deformities and marked weakness posed a challenge using the conventional Jamar dynamometer. We therefore used a fluid-filled non-elastic 6 cm diameter balloon connected to a pressure transducer and a charting system, calibrating the readings into Newtons. Over the required range, there was a linear relationship between an applied force and recorded pressure, when the volume within the system was constant. The system was calibrated using a 500 g (4.9 N) weight. The pressure exerted by the patient’s grip on the balloon was recorded over time on the chart as force–time curves. During each test, the patient sat in a standard manner, in front of the dynamometer with both arms on the table. Each arm was tested one at a time while the other arm rested on the table. Patients were instructed to squeeze the balloon as hard as possible and for as long as possible up to a maximum of 60 sec while data were captured onto a chart recorder. Patients were asked to inform the researcher if they had any pain and the assessment was stopped. Patients were not given any visual feedback during data collection. As the fluid volume within the system remained constant, the transducer measured the pressure generated within the system. This technique allowed the use of the device for all the deformities in the rheumatoid hand, as the hand could still conform easily around the balloon.</p>
<p>Force–time curves obtained were converted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412439169">Collins, 2007</xref>) into digital curves using Image/J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). The X–Y coordinates generated were transferred to a spreadsheet to generate digital curves, which were further analyzed. Several parameters were assessed for each force–time curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412439169">Figure 1</xref>). Peak force was the maximum grip strength achieved on the force–time curve, and the average force was calculated from readings in the middle half of the force–time curve excluding the first and last quartiles, as this represents the force generation and relaxation segments. Total grip time was calculated using the X-axis of the force–time curve. The plateau region of the curve was defined as the part of the curve after the peak to the end of the recorded contraction period. Variability of force generated in the plateau region was studied by assessing the standard deviation (SD) of values recorded in this region. SD of the middle half of the plateau region was also calculated to avoid the variation of the beginning and end of the plateau. The trapezoid rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412439169">Atkinson, 1989</xref>) was used in the spreadsheet to calculate the total area under the curve.</p>

</fig>
<p>As the data were not normally distributed, nonparametric tests were used. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare the grip strength variables of peak force, average force area under the curve, grip time, and variability of force in the plateau region between the different deformity groups. In situations where patterns of deformity are ordered in some way, a Jonckheere-Terpstra (J-T) test is used to check the hypothesis that the population medians are ordered in a particular direction. Hence, this test was used to investigate whether the progression of deformity from none to combined deformities was associated with a change in the different variables of grip strength and the PEM and FDS disability measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412439169">Bewick et al., 2004</xref>). Our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412439169">Dias et al., 2009</xref>) was used to decide the order in which the deformity groups should be placed for the J-T test. The correlation of grip strength and various impairment measures and disability scores was also investigated using least-squares regression, as the PEM disability score had a parametric distribution. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were plotted for the total time the patients could grip the balloon for each deformity group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412439169">Figure 2</xref>). Grip time was censored at 60 sec, as all patients had been instructed to squeeze the balloon up to a maximum of 60 sec. We compared the survival curves of different deformity groups with the no-deformity group using the corresponding Cox proportional hazards model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412439169">Spruance et al., 2004</xref>) with clustered sandwich estimation of standard errors, making allowance for correlation between the two hands of each patient. Significance was achieved if p ≤ 0.05. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS, version 13 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) and STATA, version 11.1 (StataCorp LP, Texas, USA).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean age of patients was similar in the five groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412439169">Table 1</xref>). Both the duration of disease and duration of hand involvement were shorter in patients with boutonnière deformity, while ulnar deviation at the metacarpophalangeal joints and swan neck deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joints occurred at similar periods after onset of disease. The mean duration of disease in patients with combined deformities was 23 (SE 1, range 21–25) years, and mean duration of hand involvement was 18 (SE 2, range 15–22) years. The differences between the mean duration of disease and duration of hand involvement were significant between the groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412439169">Table 1</xref>). Disability assessed using the PEM and disease-specific FDS questionnaires was most pronounced in hands with combined deformities, which were 74% (SE 4.2%) disabled according to the PEM score, and the mean FDS was 56.7 (SE 5.8) compared with a mean of 20.5 (SE 8.1) when there was ulnar deviation deformity without finger deformity. Even when no obvious disease was identified, patients still rated the hand as 49% disabled using the PEM score and scored 36 on the FDS.</p>
<p>The mean area under the force–time curve for the 86 hands was 3379.7 (SE 511) Newton-second (Ns). Hands with ulnar deviation deformity had the greatest area under the curve, with a mean of 6214.4 (SE 2878) Ns, whilst hands with combined deformities had a mean of only 949.4 (SE 206) Ns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412439169">Table 2</xref>). There was a significant difference between groups (p &lt; 0.01), and also an ordered difference on moving from the hands with ulnar deviation deformity to those with combined deformity (J-T test, p = 0.01). Mean peak force was highest in hands with ulnar deviation deformity without finger deformity (mean 90.8 N, SE 30.7 N). In those with boutonnière deformity, peak force was 82.7 (SE 15.5) N, and in the absence of swelling and deformity it was 67.1 (SE 10) N. Mean peak force in patients with swan neck deformity was 49.8 (SE 3.5) N. Differences between groups were significant using the Kruskal–Wallis test (p = 0.05), with hands with a combination of deformities being the weakest with only 34.7 (SE 8.5) N of force. There was a significant ordered decrease in peak forces (J-T test, p = 0.05) between groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412439169">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>There was a significant difference in mean ranks between different groups for average force and total grip time, and with standard deviation of the plateau region and middle half of the plateau region. Further analysis using the J-T test confirmed that there is a trend of decreasing average force for deformity groups ordered from hands with ulnar deviation of the fingers to swan neck deformities (p &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412439169">Table 2</xref>). Patients with combined deformities had the weakest hands, with lowest average strength and area under the curve. The strength of hands with swan neck deformities was around half that of patients with ulnar deviation or boutonnière deformities.</p>
<p>Variability of the plateau region was studied by analyzing the mean and SD of the plateau region. There was a similar pattern, with weak hands (e.g., those with swan neck deformities) showing the greatest variability compared with stronger hands, such as those with boutonnière and ulnar deviation deformity, but no ordered differences between groups could be identified.</p>
<p>The overlay of the mean force–time curve for each deformity group clearly illustrates the differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412439169">Figure 3</xref>). It highlights the overall loss of strength even in the hands with no obvious deformity, which were weaker than those with boutonnière deformity or ulnar deviation of the fingers. This reduction was most marked in those hands with combined deformity, although the loss of strength was also considerable in hands with swan neck deformities.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Grip strength is used as a measure of the functional capacity of the rheumatoid hand, but the rate of development of maximum grip is considered a more sensitive indicator of hand dysfunction than maximum grip strength itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412439169">Myers et al., 1980</xref>). In addition, the change in the rate of development of grip serves as a better discriminator in measuring response of patients to anti-inflammatory drug therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412439169">Palmer et al., 1981</xref>). Power generated during grip provides more information about hand function than maximum grip strength alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412439169">Palmer et al., 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Force–time curves have been previously used to study rheumatoid hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412439169">Helliwell et al., 1988</xref>). Maximum grip strength has been mathematically calculated, and time to maximum, rate of loss of grip from maximum (fatigue rate), and integral of the curve (power factor) measured to study differences compared with normal hands. We have extended the use of force–time curves to characterize differences between various rheumatoid deformity groups using the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412439169">Smith et al. (1989)</xref>. They analyzed the force–time curves for peak force, average force, and force variability, although they used it to discriminate sincere efforts from faked weakness. Rheumatoid hands are remarkably weak hands, and we felt that the study of force variability in the plateau region of the curve could be used to distinguish between weak deformed hands.</p>
<p>The presence of deformity in rheumatoid hand has a significant effect on function. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412439169">Escalante et al. (2005)</xref> recognized two distinct impairments in rheumatoid arthritis due to joint inflammation and joint deformity, which together contributed strongly to functional limitations caused by the disease. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412439169">Eberhardt et al. (1991)</xref> in their study of the occurrence of hand deformities in early rheumatoid arthritis found that those with deformity had more active disease, less grip strength, more disability, and markedly greater radiographic changes compared with patients without deformity. They grouped patients with any deformity together to compare with those who had no deformity. We have attempted to scale the deformity groups in rheumatoid arthritis in our previous study on working space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412439169">Dias et al., 2009</xref>). The impact was the lowest for hands without deformity or swelling. The boutonnière deformity, ulnar deviation of the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joint, and swan neck deformity of the fingers affect the working space in that order, with the most severe loss in patients with combined deformities. This study has revealed a different trend of weakness and disability compared with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412439169">Dias et al., 2009</xref>), in which the group with no deformity had the greatest working space. In this study, the group with ulnar deviation deformities were stronger, with the highest peak strength and areas under the curve (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412439169">Table 2</xref>). The group with no visible deformity generated smaller forces compared with patients with ulnar deviation deformity. Hands with no obvious deformity may have had inflammation affecting joints and tendon linings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412439169">Eberhardt et al., 1991</xref>). This could explain why these had lower grip strength and more disability. We believe that the weakness and disability was caused by pain and restriction due to tissue inflammation or other factors, such as myopathy or neuropathy, but these are difficult to assess. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412439169">Vliet Vlieland et al. (1996)</xref> also observed that ulnar deviation had the least effect on hand function and that swan neck deformity had a greater impact than other deformities. In our study, changes in both PEM and FDS assessments also confirmed increasing disability as finger deformities progressed from ulnar deviation to combined deformities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412439169">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The area under the curve does not differentiate between hands with weak peak force but greater sustainability and hands with greater peak force but shorter duration of grip. It correlated well with the peak and average grip strength, and reveals the same trend of decreasing area with worsening finger deformity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1753193412439169">Table 3</xref>). The regression analysis demonstrated that when investigating the effect of strength on disability of the rheumatoid hand, it is important to study the area under the curve and how long grip can be sustained, and not just the peak force. Peak force alone may not give a complete assessment of the mechanical capacity of the diseased hand. The small area under the curves confirms the marked weakness caused by swan neck and combined deformities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412439169">Table 2</xref>). Overlaying the curves gives the best visual impression of the differences between the deformity groups. In clinic, peak force still remains the easier summary assessment of the rheumatoid hand — if the correct equipment is available — but when conducting research, force–time curves give a better understanding of capacity.</p>
<p>The flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis muscles generate the main gripping force in the hand. The ulnar deviation deformity had the strongest peak and average forces, as flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis both participate in grip. The swan neck deformity causes particularly low peak and average forces, and patients can sustain grip for a very short time, as the flexor digitorum profundus is unable to contribute in patients with fixed deformities and only the flexor digitorum superficialis. Force generated by contraction of the flexor digitorum profundus is wasted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1753193412439169">Table 4</xref>), as it only causes further flexion of the distal interphalangeal joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412439169">Heywood, 1979</xref>). The relative volume of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle has been shown to be 30% greater than the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle on assessment using magnetic resonance imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412439169">Holzbaur et al., 2007</xref>) and measurement in cadavers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412439169">Lieber et al., 1992</xref>).</p>

<p>In swan neck deformity, the predominant contribution to grip is from the FDS muscle. The quadrigia effect will comprise the function of the FDP muscle on all the other digits. In Ulnar deviation deformity, both FDS and FDP contribute to grip.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In our study we found that, of the 16 hands with swan neck deformity, five hands only had one finger affected by deformity. The mean peak force of these five hands was only 45 N, suggesting that involvement of even one finger of the hand with swan neck deformity significantly incapacitates the entire hand. There was one hand in which all four fingers were affected by swan neck deformity; the other 10 hands had two digits affected by swan neck deformity. The middle finger was deformed in seven hands and was the most commonly involved digit. Interestingly, flexor muscles to the middle finger have the greatest measurement of weight of the four digits in cadaver studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412439169">Lieber et al., 1992</xref>). Eight of the 14 hands with combined deformities also had a swan neck deformity. The quadrigia effect of flexor digitorum profundus leads to the weakness of the entire hand, even when only one finger is affected. This could explain the difficulty experienced by patients with swan neck deformity in holding onto items in activities of daily living, as the flexor digitorum profundus muscle is defunctioned. The deformity leads to high variability of force generated in the plateau region of the curve also explaining the poor endurance, as the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle alone generates grip. The laxity of ligaments and joint stiffness would also contribute to weakness. None of the patients we studied had ulnar nerve involvement, so the contribution of the weaker intrinsic muscles to metacarpophalangeal joint flexion was not considered.</p>
<p>If the flexor digitorum profundus muscle could be brought back into action with the correction of the swan neck position and restoration of flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint with surgery, there should be a significant improvement in the grip strength of the hand, as the muscle mass contributing to grip is more than doubled. This should be considered when planning surgery for patients with deformities in the rheumatoid hand, and our threshold to operate on swan neck deformities, even when just one finger is involved, should be low.</p>
<p>The use of balloons to assess strength is controversial due to compressibility and recoil. We used fluid instead of air, which overcame the major problems of such systems. The closed fluid system is based on the transmission of pressure by the fluid. We standardized the conditions used for the observations of the force–time curves and the same balloon was used for all the measurements to eliminate differences due to elastic recoil within the system. Our method does not intend to provide absolute values of grip strength, but to study differences between various patterns of deformities. The closed fluid device provides more accurate data, as the volume in the system does not change and the only change detected is that in pressure. The calibrated fluid-filled balloon allowed us to measure lower forces than possible with the Jamar dynamometer in the rheumatoid hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412439169">Lee et al., 1974</xref>). Even in patients with ulnar deviation deformity, the mean strength recorded was only 90 (SE 30) N and a peak of 25 N in the presence of combined finger deformities. Patients with rheumatoid disease find rigid devices less comfortable than the softer bag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412439169">Helliwell et al., 1988</xref>). The deformed hand can accommodate the bag, and this allows assessment of strength.</p>
<p>The limitations of this study are that we used an analogue chart recorder; a digital grip measuring system could be a more efficient method to record these curves. We do not feel the usual dynamometers used in hand clinics should be used in these patients, as their deformed hands are unable to conform around the rigid handle. We only assessed grip strength and not pinch strength. Thumb deformities were recorded and measured, but these data were not considered in assessing the impact on grip strength, as this would increase the complexity of the analysis. The wrist joint plays an important role in generating grip strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412439169">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>). It is particularly difficult to measure the effect of wrist disease on grip strength in rheumatoid hands. Patients with obvious clinical wrist deformity were included in the group with combined deformity and none had had surgery on the wrist when assessed. We did not consider the wrist joint deformity in the assessments.</p>
<p>This study suggests that the hands with combined deformities are the weakest, with poor grip strength but perhaps of more note, significantly reduced sustainability of grip. Swan neck deformity profoundly affects the magnitude of grip that can be sustained for very short periods of time. It causes much greater weakness (around half the strength) than the boutonnière deformity, even when only a single finger is involved. If the swan neck deformity is corrected to flex the proximal interphalangeal joint either with fusion or a tendon re-routing procedure, we predict a substantial improvement in grip strength of the hand, as the contribution of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle to hand grip strength is restored. This should be considered during surgical correction of deformities in rheumatoid hands, particularly the swan neck deformity.</p>
