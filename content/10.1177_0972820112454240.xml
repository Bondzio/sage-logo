<abstract>
<p>This case study illustrates the story of Raja Garage Ltd, a small car repair services company based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It begins with Izat Raja’s dream to start his own business and follows his journey in pursuit of turning his dream into reality. Shortly after the establishment of his car workshop, Izat is joined by his nephew, Waleed, and together they face the obstacles that arise on their road to success. Years later, Izat’s only son, Kamran, also joins Raja Garage Ltd to find out that the company is slowly regressing and may be on the brink of failure. Kamran decides to take over the family business and shares his ideas with his father, ideas which he believes could salvage the company. Recently recovering from the impact of the financial crisis, Raja Garage Ltd has proven its capacity to overcome multiple challenges throughout its years of existence. Yet, the company’s current survival and future development hinges upon the family members’ ability to make the right decisions.</p>
