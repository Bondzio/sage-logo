<p>Corrigendum to the article ‘The Effect of Pupil Absenteeism on Literacy and Numeracy in the Primary School’ by H.C.M. (Tim) Carroll, Journal of School Psychology International, DOI: 10.1177/0143034310361674, published in issue, April 2010, 31(2) 115--130.</p>
<p>The error resulted from the author: (i) confusing the length of a school week and a calendar week; and (ii) taking the length of the thirteen-week school term to be equivalent to one-quarter of a year. The actual error occurs on p.123, 15<sup>th</sup> line of the paragraph, where it is stated: “the duration of one school term was 0.25 of a year.” In fact, if one takes one school year to be 190 days (<italic>The Education (School Day and School Year) (England) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999 No. 3181</italic>). <italic>London: The Stationery Office),</italic> the duration of one school term should have been taken to be either 63 or 64 and not 91 (0.25 x 364) days. On pages 115, 123,126 and 127 the error is compounded because the two-term difference in attendance between the two attendance groups between the ages of 7 and 11 years is incorrectly given as half a year (182 days): the figure should have been 127 days. Because of the error the effect of the absence on the attainments is considerably under-estimated. This is revealed in the following examples in which the errors and corrections are given in italic and dense type respectively.

<p>The author offers SPI readers his most sincere apologies for the error.</p>
