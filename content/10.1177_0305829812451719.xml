<p>If the 1990s was the decade of ‘globalisation’ and the decline of the state, the trend since then seems to be of increasingly powerful states ‘rising up’ just about everywhere. How these two processes relate to each other is one of the central riddles of International Relations today. The essays collected by Christophe Jaffrelot in <italic>The Emerging States: The Wellspring of a New World Order</italic> bring together some of the thinking going on at Sciences Po on this subject.</p>
<p>This is really a collection of short, pointed essays (29 in total, from over 30 authors). The first chapters discuss the concept of what it means to be ‘emerging’ – whether the object of emergence is taken to be states, powers or economies – a question which is never really agreed upon by the contributors to this volume. In the end, emergence is defined basically (and not unreasonably) in economic terms, which is, as Gabas and Losch point out in their contribution (pp. 13–27), indeed what the doyens in the financial organisations and ratings agencies had in mind when they invented the category of ‘emerging markets’ in the 1980s. Whatever they may be, emerging states are not at the moment a military phenomenon. Graphs comparing the US to ‘emerging’ states in the military sphere still have to be shown in logarithmic scale.</p>
<p>The next set of chapters examines a selection of country and regional cases, although the three regional chapters seem less concerned with rising powers as with the development of particular regional integration projects in Latin America, Asia and Europe. Domenach is sceptical of China’s rise, seeing it as largely the product of previous stagnation and not yet a modern power; while Jaffrelot takes a more positive view of India’s Nehruvian strategy of the pre-liberalisation phase. Rouquie’s explanation for Brazil’s rise convincingly singles out expanding economic growth combined with an assertive foreign policy and regional predominance. These are the rising countries everyone can agree on. Three others are more contested – Mexico (‘in the shadow of the superpower’), Turkey (presumably also under a shadow, perhaps more than one) and South Africa (‘A power only in the eyes of others?’). Russia, as ever, constitutes its own category.</p>
<p>What is most astonishing about such essays is what they apparently take for granted, something which until recently was considered by many to be basically impossible: the ignition of large-scale development in the former Third World, contemporaneously with economic liberalisation and integration. One aspect of the linkages between globalisation and the emerging states phenomenon is examined in Rahmouni-Rousseau’s chapter on the financial markets of emerging countries (pp. 291–302). This highlights the role played by the liberalisation of capital flows and the consequent rush of private capital to emerging countries (well, primarily, China).</p>
<p>Tempering this success story are two chapters detailing the limitations of 21st-century ‘emergence’. The first covers the explosion of inequality with the rise of China and India (although the authors insist first on introducing their own peculiar nomenclature). While starting out as relatively egalitarian, China and India now are symptomatic of the global maldistribution of wealth in the network economy. Growth in emerging powers has cost them social justice. The second is the chapter on the environmental limits to continued economic emergence, although the chapter is heavily Sino-centric. Nature and the finite resources of planet Earth haunt the development of emerging states: if China alone consumed as much oil per capita as the US, by 2031 its daily oil needs would exceed current <italic>world</italic> production by 25% (p. 309).</p>
<p>It is really the last group of chapters which take up the spirit of the title of the book: the crucial question of the impact of the new distribution of power on world order. This section turns to the effects of emerging states on the global economy and of their behaviour in the multilateral contexts of development aid, human rights, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations (UN). Already, significant changes in each of these arenas are detected: who gives aid to whom and why is changing, the human rights outlook of emerging countries varies, while it is increasingly difficult for the established countries to get their way in the WTO and UN. Whether this is all really enough to justify the title of the book – one thinks it would be more appropriate to have a question mark at the end – will not be definitively answered by this volume. While a fascinating discussion of a critical contemporary subject with an abundance of interesting and important information, the brevity of the chapters prohibits extended analysis or profound insights, and there is a difficulty in drawing together a consistent focus in a book of so many chapters. Furthermore, some will find irritating the many references to sources not appearing in the bibliographies, while the lack of an index is a serious omission in such a collection. Nonetheless, this is a formidable contribution with a wealth of diverse arguments which any student of emerging powers would do well to examine.</p>
