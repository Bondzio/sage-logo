<abstract>
<p><italic>Introduction</italic>: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the method of choice for long-term nutrition in patients with longstanding eating difficulties due to pathological entities that impair swallowing. The feeding catheters are designed to be removed by external traction or by endoscopy. <italic>Aim</italic>: To evaluate the feasibility of the cut-and-push method as a possible safe alternative to the pullout method for removal of soft PEG devices with a large caliber. <italic>Methods</italic>: Patients with 20 French (Fr) or larger soft PEG system were enrolled for PEG removal by the cut-and-push technique. The replacement catheters were 2 Fr larger than the original ones. Patients were observed at 24 and 72 hours via home nursing care and then weekly for 1 month for signs of intestinal obstruction, tube leakage, or blockage. <italic>Results</italic>: Seventy-nine patients (52 men; mean age 67 years) underwent the procedure: 42 due to leakage and 37 due to blockage. Mean time before tube removal was 4.8 months (range, 3–8). PEG devices were 20 Fr and 24 Fr in 57 (72.2%) and 22 (27.8%) cases, respectively. Collection of the inner component from stool was reported within 48 hours in 63 cases (80%). No cases of intestinal obstruction or other severe adverse events due to the inner component being eliminated throughout the intestine were observed in any patient during the study. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: The cut-and-push method employed for removal of a soft PEG tube with a large caliber seems to be safe and can be performed when removal by external traction may determine the occurrence of peristomal complications or jeopardize PEG replacement.</p>

<p>Malnutrition is a well-known life-threatening condition that may favor the occurrence and worsening of comorbidities and reduces healing processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613486933">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533613486933">2</xref></sup> Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the method of choice for long-term nutrition in patients with longstanding eating difficulties due to pathological entities that impair swallowing such as neurological impairment, trauma, and malignant diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613486933">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613486933">4</xref></sup> When a PEG tube is no longer necessary or when malfunctioning and complications occur, the feeding catheter is removed or replaced (according to PEG models and clinical status) by external traction, endoscopy, or the cut-and-push method. This latter technique was developed in the 1990s to avoid endoscopic removal, which may be cumbersome and exposes patients to preventable risks and complications related to the procedure. So far, few studies have been conducted demonstrating the safety of the cut-and-push method of PEG removal up to 15 French (Fr) caliber.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613486933">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613486933"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613486933">7</xref></sup> However, concerns with this method arose from reports of severe complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613486933">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533613486933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533613486933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533613486933"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533613486933">12</xref></sup> Many queries with the technique are pending, and well-established indications and limits are far from being defined. Moreover, the development of a refined PEG tube designed to be removed by traction has reduced the clinical impact of the cut-and-push technique. However, some conditions can prevent flange retrieval, such as failure to deflate the gastric cuff or the presence of an old inner bumper broken off in the gastric lumen. This method might also present difficulties when performed with large catheters in frail patients on anticoagulation or in developing countries where specialized medical staff is lacking. Moreover, the softer and more malleable inner bumpers of these devices open the possibility of removing a larger tube, commonly employed for long-term nutrition, by the cut-and-push method.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the above-mentioned results and limits of this technique, we performed a prospective study to further evaluate the feasibility of the cut-and-push method using a modern PEG system with larger calibers in patients handled at home by caregivers.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>From January 2009 to December 2011, 79 patients were assessed for PEG tube removal by the cut-and-push method by 2 skilled gastroenterologists at the Internal Medicine Department, Armed Forces Hospital Southern Region, Khamis Mushyt, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. At this center, more than 300 PEG tube placements per year are performed regularly. For this study, the indications for PEG placement were cerebrovascular accident, advanced Parkinson disease, and motor neuron disease. Patients with predisposing conditions for obstruction were excluded from the study; the conditions that contraindicated PEG tube removal by the “cut-and-push” method were the following:</p>

<list-item><p>Intestinal dysmotility</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cystic fibrosis</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Leakage was defined as tube-feeding formula and/or gastric contents around the PEG site leaking from the stoma or from the tube itself. The PEG catheter was defined as blocked if all efforts to unclog it were not successful.</p>
<p>Patients on PEG feeding with 20 Fr or larger catheters (Endovive Standard PEG kit; Boston Scientific Corp, Natick, MA) were enrolled for PEG removal by the cut-and-push technique. All tubes, made of silicone, were mobilized; the peristomal site was then cleaned and catheters were removed by cutting them flush to the skin and the remnant pushed into the stomach. The replacement catheters were 2 Fr larger than the original ones (Endovive Balloon PEG Replacement; Boston Scientific Corp). However, 24 Fr PEG tubes were the maximum size employed for replacement. Patients were observed at 24 and 72 hours via home nursing care and then weekly for 1 month for any sign of intestinal obstruction, tube leakage, or blockage.</p>
<p>We did not perform routine abdominal radiography at 1 or 2 weeks after removal to ensure that the inner component had been passed. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the local ethics committee.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the study to remove impaired PEG tubes by the cut-and-push technique. Main demographic characteristics of the study population and reasons for initial PEG placement are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533613486933">Table 1</xref>. The mean time that PEG tubes were in place before removal was 4.8 months (range, 3–8 months). Indication for replacement was leakage in 42 patients (53.2%) and blockage in 37 patients (46.8%), respectively. Only 4 (5%) second replacements occurred: 2 replacements were performed for leakage within 72 hours and 2 other replacements for blockage within 1 month.</p>

<p>PEG devices that were treated by the cut-and-push method were of the following sizes: 20 Fr and 24 Fr in 57 (72.2%) and 22 cases (27.8%), respectively. Collection of the inner component from stool was reported by the caregivers in 63 cases (79.7%) within 48 hours and in 11 cases within 5 days (14.0%). Five remnants (6.3%) were not collected from feces.</p>
<p>No cases of intestinal obstruction or other severe adverse events due to the inner component being eliminated throughout the intestine were observed in any patient during the study.</p>
<p>Four of the 5 patients who did not pass the remnants are still alive without any abdominal complications after 12 months since the last patient completed the study. One patient died of another massive hemorrhagic stroke approximately 7 months after PEG replacement.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PEG feeding is the method of choice for long-term nutrition in malnourished patients with swallowing impairment. Generally, if patients are on anticoagulation or have had difficulty with a “bedside” removal and replacement, PEG tubes are removed by endoscopy, leading to an important effort in terms of risks and costs. Therefore, the cut-and-push technique is an important resource that avoids having frail patients moved to the hospital to undergo a further endoscopic procedure. So far, many studies have demonstrated the safety of this method for soft devices no larger than 15 Fr in patients without an impaired gastrointestinal transit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613486933">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613486933"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613486933">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The development of softer and more flexible inner components has led to the production of PEG tubes removable by external traction. This technique shares the same advantages of the cut-and-push method without the risk of intestinal obstruction. However, the inner bumper may break off in the stomach, or encrustation or failure to deflate the gastric cuff can jeopardize flange retrieval, but the cut-and-push method can be useful even for these devices, as reported by Pearce et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613486933">5</xref></sup> In our experience, traction of a large catheter might also lead to a bigger fistula site that may cause leakage from sides of the orifice as the orifice may exceed the maximum tube size available for replacement. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published data about the feasibility of the cut-and-push technique on very large PEG devices with a malleable inner bumper.</p>
<p>In our series, all tubes removed were larger than 15 Fr (20 Fr and 24 Fr). Although 5 remnants were not collected from feces, no cases of intestinal obstruction were noted (abdominal pain, absolute constipation, abdominal tenderness, nausea, or vomiting) during the study. Some alarming cases reported obstruction or perforation due to the inner flange embedded within the intestinal wall several months after the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613486933">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533613486933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533613486933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533613486933"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533613486933">12</xref></sup> Therefore, we recognize that a follow-up period of 1 month might underestimate the real hazards of the cut-and-push technique. However, most patients are still followed through the home health nursing team, and no patients were readmitted for complications related to the procedure during the 2-year study period or in the 12 months since the last patient completed the study. Only 1 patient died for reasons not related to PEG replacement. It must be emphasized that the relevance of this observation is limited because these data represent a post hoc evaluation.</p>
<p>Because of the soft design of the tube employed and in accordance with the series by Merrick et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613486933">6</xref></sup> and Kejariwal et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613486933">7</xref></sup> we did not perform abdominal x-rays. We believe that there is no need to confirm by radiology that the inner compound has passed throughout the intestinal tract unless patients are symptomatic for obstruction. This policy may contribute to saving medical and financial resources and is confirmed to be safe for the patients. Scientific innovation is making PEG tube removal and replacement less invasive, less cumbersome, and cost-effective. Thus, removal by traction should be recommended as the method of choice whenever possible. On the other hand, softer and flexible inner flanges provide a new perspective to the cut-and-push method by increasing its safety and extending its applicability to larger PEG tubes in the presence of specific conditions.</p>
<p>This is the first prospective study performed with PEG tubes up to 24 Fr in size. For this reason, we preferred to remove all tubes at our endoscopy unit. However, all patients were discharged within 1 hour and monitored at home for the entire duration of the study by caregivers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study shows that PEG tubes larger than 15 Fr removable by traction can be easily and safely removed by the cut-and-push technique. We speculate that this procedure could be done at home by a specialized nurse.</p>
