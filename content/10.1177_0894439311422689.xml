<abstract>
<p>Cybercrime and the threat it creates are growing in its reach, in accordance with similar growth in information technology. Some countries account for more of the variation in cybercrime activity than others, which affects less criminally involved nations as well, considering that cybercrime does not respect national borders over the Internet. Routine activity theory (RAT) has been used to explain cybercrime at the individual level, but not at the national level. Much research has focused on high cybercrime countries, but this research is often conducted by cybersecurity firms and is exclusively descriptive, making no inferences. This research sought to determine what characteristics predict whether a nation is high in either spamming activity or phishing activity. In a sample of 132 countries, it was found that wealthier nations with more Internet users per capita had higher cybercrime activity. Unemployment was also found to interact with Internet users such that the effect of the proportion of Internet users on spam was strongest in nations with higher unemployment. The implications these findings have for policy and suggestions for future research are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is little doubt in the significant amount of growth that can be attributed to cybercrime activities over the preceding decades. Illegal activities using computers or computer networks have grown just as fast as technology has expanded and improved. Cybercriminals have become organized in such a way that has allowed the crimes they commit to become part of a booming business model.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals are often both versatile and specialized as a group with regard to the crimes they commit. The creation and distribution of malware is a booming business, with a profitable marketplace and division of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32b-0894439311422689">Schiller et al., 2007</xref>). A common theme throughout most cybercrime operations is the defrauding of victims for profit. Phishing costs the United States 52.6 billion a year alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311422689">Brody, Mulig, &amp; Kimball, 2007</xref>) and advance fee fraud costs individuals an average of $3,864.00 per scam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14a-0894439311422689">Dyrud, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Some countries account for a disproportionate amount of the cybercrime activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6b-0894439311422689">Bookman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15a-0894439311422689">Fossi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22a-0894439311422689">IBM X-Force, 2010</xref>; Security Threat Report, 2010). Even if someone does not reside in one of these countries, the security threats of cybercrime are often not reduced. Cybercrime attacks are most often directed over the Internet, and the Internet, for the most part, knows no national borders. A cybercriminal in China can still be a threat to citizens within the United States. Therefore, it is important that attempts be made to fight cybercrime anywhere it occurs in the world. But to fight cybercrime, it must be known what influences it.</p>
<p>There is some literature on the theories of cybercrime. Among the most prominent theories is routine activity theory (RAT), formerly used to predict aggregate street crime rates but has since been adapted to fit the cybercriminal. There is some evidence to support RAT in terms of predicting cybercrime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894439311422689">Bossler &amp; Holt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894439311422689">Choi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894439311422689">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894439311422689">Hutchings &amp; Hayes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439311422689">Pratt, Holtfreter, &amp; Reisig, 2010</xref>). However, RAT has been used only to predict whether an individual will be the recipient of cybercrime and will engage in deviance online. There has not yet been research linking RAT with cybercrime at an aggregate level such as that of nations.</p>
<p>Research has focused on which countries are high in cybercrime activities. But this research does not report why these countries are at such security risk. Furthermore, the bulk of this research has not used rigorous scientific practices. The reports are mostly descriptive, with few to no inferential statistics used.</p>
<p>This research is intended to fill these gaps. What characteristics of each country predict its cybercrime activity? There are three research questions here related to the three conditions of RAT. One question is whether the number of Internet users per capita, considered a measure of potential victims, relates to cybercrime. The second concerns whether unemployment rates, possibly motivating some individuals to commit crime, also relate to cybercrime. Finally, it is asked whether a nation’s willingness to create anticybercrime legislation has any kind of effect on cybercrime at the national level.</p>
<p>The best approach for fighting cybercrime is through international treaties and cooperation, considering the global nature of the crime involved. But policy might also be advised to target what predicts a country’s cybercrime involvement in the first place. Perhaps equipped with a better theoretical foundation of national cybercrime, international law can also take a preventative approach to fighting cybercrime abroad as well as its normal reactive approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0894439311422689">
<title>International Laws on Cybercrime</title>
<p>Perhaps the best long-term strategy for fighting cybercrime is through international agreements to collaborate on bringing computer crime offenders to justice. Given the global reach of the Internet, cybercrime itself can originate anywhere on the globe and target any country that has Internet users. A recurring problem is the mix of jurisdictions that cybercrime crosses.</p>
<p>Most efforts in the fight against cybercrime are through technical security measures, such as antivirus, spam filtering, and encryption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311422689">Balkin, Grimmelmann, Kozlovski, Wagman, &amp; Zarsky, 2007</xref>). This prevents cyberattacks from succeeding where these security measures are sufficient, but does not prevent the cybercriminal from finding suitable targets elsewhere. Potentially, the best means to eliminate a cybercriminal’s attacks completely is by incarcerating the offender, which requires law enforcement. Ideally, incarceration would also have a deterrent effect beyond incapacitation, but it is uncertain to what degree law enforcement is capable of having this effect. Hopefully, incapacitation alone would have an effect, but it may also be that cybercriminals fill a niche that is easily refilled with other offenders willing to take the jailed cybercriminal’s place.</p>
<p>Considering that only a portion of cybercrimes committed in any given country actually originated in that country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311422689">Balkin et al., 2007</xref>), many offenders may not fall under the law enforcing nation’s jurisdiction. The most promising type of anticybercrime legislation will be that which multiple nations agree to enforce in addition to the agreement to aid other nations when multiple countries are involved.</p>
<p>One treaty between nations includes the Tripartite Memorandum of Understanding on Spam Enforcement Cooperation. This is a law internationally agreed upon between the United States, Australia, Canada, and the European Union including the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439311422689">Moustakas, Ranganathan, &amp; Duquenoy, 2005</xref>). Cybercrime is exclusively limited to bulk unsolicited commercial electronic messages, such as the varying types of spam (e.g., e-mail spam, instant message spam, and comment spam).</p>
<p>Other international spam legislation includes the London Action Plan on Spam, which is an action plan agreed by 19 bodies from 15 countries. The agreement involves the active collaboration among member countries in sharing information and consenting to aid other nations when the source of a spamming offense originates within their territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894439311422689">London Action Plan on Spam, 2004</xref>). Member states include the United Kingdom, the United States, Switzerland, Ireland, Japan, Chile, and nine other states.</p>
<p>However, the number of member states agreeing to these treaties is not large and the type of cybercrime is limited to spam. Although spam is probably the most common form of cybercrime to cross national borders, other legislation has taken on a broader number of countries and range of criminal acts under the umbrella of cybercrime. One prominent and ongoing piece of legislation includes the Convention on Cybercrime. The treaty was set forth by a committee under the Council of Europe in Strasbourg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14b-0894439311422689">Eccles, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The intent was to establish a minimum set of laws to combat high-tech crimes. The range of crimes that fall under the scope of this legislation includes copyright infringement, unauthorized access to networks or network resources, child pornography, and data interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14b-0894439311422689">Eccles, 2001</xref>). The aims of the convention are to unify laws between nations in the pursuit of cybercrime violations, providing domestic procedural law powers for investigating and prosecuting offences that transgress cybercrime laws, as well as sharing evidence between participating states when investigating such offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439311422689">Convention on Cybercrime, 2001</xref>). Not just member states of the Council of Europe are encouraged to sign the treaty. As of this writing, 46 countries have signed the treaty, with 29 ratifying and enforcing the legislative agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439311422689">Convention on Cybercrime, 2010</xref>). The treaty is open to be signed by both member states of Europe and nonmember states that have participated in the treaties elaboration. This includes a total of 58 nations that have participated in the law’s creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439311422689">Convention on Cybercrime, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While this legislation sounds expansive enough to pose a plausible threat to cybercrime to some degree, it is too early to determine the efficacy of such efforts. The number of countries ratifying the Convention on Cybercrime may not be of sufficient number to pose a serious threat to many countries that are known to harbor cybercriminals when those nations are not participants in such legislation. Fortunately, the Convention on Cybercrime is still open for additional signatures by other countries and may be largely beneficial to the fight against cybercrime in the future.</p>

<sec id="section3-0894439311422689">
<title>Theories of Cybercrime</title>
<p>Criminal law is only as good as the theory underlying the behavior it is intended to deter or limit. There has been some debate about applying new theories of crime to cybercrime that is different from street crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894439311422689">Adams, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894439311422689">Capeller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894439311422689">Dodge &amp; Kitchin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894439311422689">Snyder, 2001</xref>). However, RAT, formerly applied to aggregate level crime rates in general, has been considered appropriate for cybercrimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894439311422689">Pease, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894439311422689">Yar, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>RAT is an ecological approach to crime causation, and the accessibility, location, and presence or absence of environmental characteristics, and certain types of people are what proves predictive of criminal behavior. The RAT requires three situations to be true and meet in space for there to be a crime that is committed. These include (a) a motivated offender, (b) a suitable target, and (c) the absence of a capable guardian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439311422689">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>A motivated offender must be someone willing to commit a crime should opportunity allow it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894439311422689">Akers &amp; Sellers, 2004</xref>). A suitable target is one the motivated offender values (credit card information). It is also visible, accessible, and able to be misappropriated by the offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894439311422689">Felson &amp; Clarke, 1998</xref>). Finally, a capable guardian must be absent, which is anything that obstructs the offender’s ability to acquire the target (encryption, antivirus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439311422689">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>). Research has linked aggregate routine activities (number of available automobiles, unoccupied homes) to crime rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439311422689">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>) as well as individual routine activities (proximity to delinquent peers, time away from home) to crime and crime victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894439311422689">Schreck &amp; Fisher, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894439311422689">Schreck, Stewart, &amp; Fisher, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has also found some support for the three RAT conditions and whether a crime in cyberspace occurs. Surveys and interviews have found that people’s actions that make them more suitable to offenders, such as time spent online, more use of Internet banking, making more online purchases, and risky online behavior (e.g., using P2P file sharing), often are more likely to be the recipients of cyberbullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894439311422689">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>), receive more phishing attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894439311422689">Hutchings &amp; Hayes, 2009</xref>), are more often targeted by Internet fraud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439311422689">Pratt et al., 2010</xref>) as well as other forms of fraud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439311422689">Holtfreter, Reisig, &amp; Pratt, 2008</xref>), and lose more time due to malware infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894439311422689">Bossler &amp; Holt, 2007</xref>). Additionally, lack of antivirus, antispyware, and firewalls (capable guardians) are associated with more malware victimizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894439311422689">Choi, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of this research, there appears to be some support for RAT in explaining the likelihood of being the target or victim of a cybercrime attack. However, most research to date only attempts to explain cybercrime at the individual level. That is, whether individual characteristics predict subsequent cybercrime victimization for that individual. There does not appear to be literature testing RAT at the national level when cybercrime is the crime type of interest. It is not easy to predict whether a country will more likely be the source of a cyberattack or be the place of residence for a disproportionate number of cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Therefore, it becomes beneficial to apply RAT to countries when investigating cybercrime. Some countries are known to be more problematic than others in terms of cybercrime activity. It is thus important to know what influences and variables can explain the variation in countries by cybercrime activity; and whether RAT is sufficient to explain these differences or whether a new theory is necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0894439311422689">
<title>High Cybercrime Countries</title>
<p>There are two ways to measure which countries are high in cybercrime. One is to measure where most cybercriminals live in physical space. Surely, some countries are home to more cybercriminals than others. The second means of measuring high cybercrime countries is to determine from which nations cyberattacks are coming from. For instance, which countries host the most phishing servers, which are the source of most spam messages, and which countries contain the most botnet zombies.</p>
<p>Where the cybercriminals live is not necessarily where the cyberattacks are coming from. An offender from Romania can control zombies in a botnet, mostly located in the United States, from which to send spam to countries all over the world, with links contained in them to phishing sites located in China. The cybercriminal’s reach is not limited by national borders.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important measure is where cybercriminals themselves reside. This is difficult to measure as cybercriminals maintain significant anonymity over the networks they exploit, and there are few cybercriminals in prison. There is some consensus, however, as to which regions retain more offenders. Many have been known to reside in Eastern Europe, Russia, and Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894439311422689">Alganandam, Mittal, Singh, &amp; Fleizach, 2005</xref>). Countries such as these with fewer anticybercrime regulations and many absolute Internet users are suspected of being home to more offenders. Particularly, Russia is known to have tolerated cybercriminals in its past. Many among Russia’s law enforcement were known to take bribes from cybercriminals and only pursue offenders should they target victims in their own country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6a-0894439311422689">Barham, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Some efforts to measure cybercriminal location are more quantifiable than simply describing events in each country. There are methods available to determine what verbal language was used to compile software. In order to write software, software tools such as a compiler are required. Compilers can be acquired that vary in the spoken language they were meant for. Some efforts to measure the spoken language a compiler was intended for that was used to write malware from a malware sample itself has been carried out. The four most common spoken languages were, in descending order, non-British English, Chinese, Brazilian, and Russian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311422689">Greenberg, 2007</xref>). However, this does not necessarily relate to the exact country the malware was written in.</p>
<p>While it is important to know where cybercriminals reside, it is much easier to measure from where cyberattacks originate across the globe. Many cyberattacks travel across the Internet, and in order to get anywhere on the Internet, routers and servers must know the transmission’s address in cyberspace at one point during a message’s transit through a network. Cyberattacks are digital in nature, consisting of data that reside, at least temporarily, on computers. Determining where cyberattacks come from is simply a matter of acquiring these data. Fortunately many firms, especially cybersecurity companies, have tremendous amounts of these data. Cybersecurity firms that sell spam filters can track spam; firms that distribute antivirus software can track malware; and companies that offer website security can track attacks on those websites. These cyberattacks can be geolocated to specific countries.</p>
<p>A blog entry released by security firm <italic>TrendMicro</italic> reported on the breakdown of spam-sending continents. Thirty-eight percent originated from Europe, 31% from Asia, and 14% of spam was sent from North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6b-0894439311422689">Bookman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Another effort to measure spam is that by Project Honey Pot. Project honey pot is an organization that allows any registrant at the site with his or her own website hosting to help gather spam statistics for them. Today Project Honey Pot has statistics on over a billion spam messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894439311422689">Project Honey Pot Statistics, 2010</xref>). According to the project’s statistics, the top spamming countries in descending order are China, Brazil, the United States, Germany, and Russia. Bots that harvest e-mail addresses off the Internet are also tracked. Countries that contain the most harvesters in descending order are China, Spain, the United States, Romania, and Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894439311422689">Project Honey Pot Statistics, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple cybersecurity firms regularly release detailed reports on the state of cybercrime activities within their networks, often including a section on countries. Symantec has created an index of cybercrime activity that includes hosting malware, botnets, phishing server hosting, and how many botnet command and control (C&amp;C) servers are there within the nation. The top Five nations on this index include the United States, China, Brazil, Germany, and India. Russia stands seventh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15a-0894439311422689">Fossi et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The International Business Machines (IBM) also has an annual report on cybercrime. IBM ranked the top spam uniform resource locator (URL) countries. Spam messages often include links to either spamvertised product websites (e.g., Viagra) or malicious websites that distribute malware. The five countries that hosted the most spamvertised websites include China, the United States, South Korea, Moldova, and Russia. Brazil was sixth in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22a-0894439311422689">IBM X-Force, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Sophos released a report in 2010 measuring malware hosting countries. Servers that host malware can exploit vulnerabilities in a visitor’s browser to install the malicious software. The top countries in terms of malicious hosting were the United States, Russia, China, Peru, and Germany. South Korea was sixth and the United Kingdom was tenth (Security Threat Report, 2010). These two countries are suspected to be high in cybercrime as well.</p>
<p>Knowing which countries are the source of cyberattacks is important. It is possible that there exists a relationship between cyberattack source and cybercriminal source. The research by cybersecurity firms can be a useful measure of high cybercrime countries. However, the reports and statistics released by these companies are purely descriptive. They describe which countries are higher or lower in terms of cyberattacks. No use of multivariate statistics is mentioned. There is no effort to determine relationships among variables that contribute to whether a country is the source of a cyberattack. That is why no theoretical foundation can be extracted from these reports regarding cybercrime countries.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this research to find not only which countries are high in terms of cybercrime but also what influences can explain the reasons for these criminal activities. What variables are predictive of why North America is a bigger spamming continent than Africa? Why is Brazil assumed to house more cybercriminals than India? It is the hope of this article that some of these questions can be answered.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The population from which the sample was drawn from includes all sovereign countries on Earth. The exact number of countries in the world varies depending on how the number is estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311422689">Rosenberg, 2010</xref>). The count of countries can range from 193 to 200. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311422689">Bureau of Intelligence and Research (2009)</xref> estimates the count to be 194.</p>
<p>The data used in this research come from multiple sources. Not all of these sources are exhaustive in tabulating data on approximately all 194 countries. The nations used in the sample were selected based on convenience and on whether the data for all variables could be acquired for each country. Listwise deletion eliminated any case with one or more missing values, resulting in <italic>n</italic> = 132 nations or 68% of the population of countries. There may be systematic reasons why data were missing for certain countries, such as those countries being smaller, poorer, or less advanced and therefore having less data on them.</p>

<sec id="section7-0894439311422689">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>There are three predictor variables based on theory: Internet users per capita, unemployment rates, and international cybercrime law enforcement and cooperation. <italic>Internet users</italic> per capita was taken from the Internet World Stats Website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm">http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm</ext-link>, retrieved December 2, 2010), which contain only such data. This site provides data on the percentage of the population of each country who were Internet users during 2010. There are data on 216 countries at the time of this writing. The number of Internet users is hoped to reflect the number of potential victims of cybercrime (both people willing to fall prey to social engineering and the number of Internet-ready computers to infect).</p>

<p>Data on unemployment were acquired for 198 nations from the 2008 World Factbook (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.photius.com/rankings/economy/unemployment_rate_2008_1.html">http://www.photius.com/rankings/economy/unemployment_rate_2008_1.html</ext-link>, retrieved February 13, 2011). This variable was significantly skewed (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). A log transform was sufficient in eliminating skew (<italic>p</italic> = .68). It is hoped that high unemployment also means lack of legitimate information technology (IT) jobs, motivating those with IT skills to rely on cybercrime.</p>

<sec id="section9-0894439311422689">
<title>Internet users × unemployment interaction</title>
<p>Internet users per capita and the unemployment rate were multiplied together to measure an interaction between the two. It is questioned whether countries with many Internet users but high unemployment in their economic environments may have a worsening effect on cybercrime outcomes, as this might measure many citizens with IT skills but no legal means to employ them.</p>

<title>International cybercrime laws</title>
<p>A country’s willingness to fight cybercrime was measured by a four-level ordinal variable that was dummy coded. The anticybercrime legislation used was the Convention on Cybercrime proposed by the Council of Europe. The first level of this variable includes all countries that have neither participated in creating the legislation nor signed it. The second level includes all countries that have participated in the legislation but have not signed it. The third level includes countries that have signed but not ratified the legislation. Finally, the fourth category represents countries that have ratified and enforced the treaty (30 countries; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439311422689">Convention on Cybercrime, 2010</xref>). An additional dichotomous variable was created to represent nations that have participated in the legislation (54) versus ones that have not (78). This will be to prevent relying on too many predictor variables in subsequent regression models. One limitation of this variable is that it may represent the countries of the Council of Europe better than countries that are not member countries of Europe. As of February 6, 2010, 11 nonmember countries have participated in the legislation, 4 have signed it, and 1 has ratified it (the United States). There are 47 member states that have at least participated in the legislation. The validity of this measure is therefore uncertain, and any interpretation of such a variable will have to be done with skepticism. Fortunately, continents such as Europe will be controlled for, as discussed below, although this is unlikely to be a sufficient correction to the limitation of this measure. Ideally, this measure indicates the willingness of a nation to punish cybercriminals within their jurisdiction (capable guardians), which could have an effect on cyberattacks.</p>
<p>There are three control variables: continent, gross domestic product (GDP), and population size. <italic>Continent</italic> will be a dummy coded measure of seven relevant continents/regions of the world (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Oceania). This is intended to control for spatial dependency to some degree. Africa will be used as the reference category because Africa is assumed to be the least active as a continent in terms of cybercrime activity. African nations rarely show up in top 10 lists of cybercrime activity and the continent is known to send less spam than other continents/regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15a-0894439311422689">Fossi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22a-0894439311422689">IBM X-Force, 2010</xref>; Security Threat Report, 2010).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0894439311422689">
<title>GDP per capita</title>
<p>A measure of GDP was taken from the International Monetary Fund’s 2009 report (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/cU3qXZ">http://bit.ly/cU3qXZ</ext-link>, retrieved November 23, 2010). The report contains a table of GDP per country that totals 181 countries. This measure was divided by population size (described below) and multiplied by 1 billion (GDP is represented in billions of dollars). GDP allows for the wealth of each nation to be controlled for. These variables were significantly skewed (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). A log transform resulted in no significant skewness (<italic>p</italic> = .86).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0894439311422689">
<title>Population</title>
<p>Population size was acquired from the same data set from which the Internet users per capita measure was obtained from. There are data for 216 countries and their population sizes. Using the same source for these two variables is preferable because the Internet users per capita measure is computed using population size. Refer to the Internet users per capita variable above for further details. Population was skewed (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and therefore had to be logarithmically transformed (<italic>p</italic> = .81).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0894439311422689">
<title>Spam rate</title>
<p>One dependent variable (DV) is intended to represent spam sent per country in 2008 as a rate based on population size. The spam rate data were taken from a sample of 725,037 spam e-mail messages received in honey net bait e-mail addresses within the United States. The spam messages were gathered from spam archives by Untroubled Software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.untroubled.org/spam">http://www.untroubled.org/spam</ext-link>, retrieved January 3, 2009). A data set was created from this sample of spam e-mails by a script written in PERL (practical extraction and report language). The script read each individual spam e-mail, extracted the originating Internet protocol (IP) address from each e-mail (which is assumed to be the bottom-most IP address in the message’s headers), and looked up the IP address in a database of world addresses (which was downloaded from Webnet77, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software77.net/cgi-bin/ip-country/geo-ip.pl">http://software77.net/cgi-bin/ip-country/geo-ip.pl</ext-link>, retrieved March 20, 2009) and saved each message’s country code to a spreadsheet. The data were then aggregated by nation, creating a count of spam messages sent per country. The variable was then used as a rate based on population size. This variable was created from a larger data set taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894439311422689">Kigerl (2009)</xref>. Aggregated by nation, there were 169 countries that had sent one or more spam message in 2008. This variable most likely represents cyberattack source or where spam is being sent from (which may be spoofed, but it is not known how much of spam this applies to). The variable is not a measure of cybercriminal location, however, although it is possible that there is a relationship between the two.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0894439311422689">
<title>Phishing top-level domain (TLD) rate</title>
<p>A second DV was intended to measure which countries were associated with more phishing attacks. Phishing TLD is the count of unique phishing servers that use a TLD representing a certain nation. TLDs (such as .com and .net) can also represent a country code (.us, .uk). For example, in 2010, 197 phishing domain names had the form “<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.{DomainName}.us,”">http://www.{DomainName}.us,”</ext-link> resulting in the United States being coded as being the source of 197 phishing attacks. The TLD count was used as a rate based on population size. The data were taken from a report authored by the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30a-0894439311422689">Rasmussen, Aaron, &amp; Aaron, 2010</xref>). The TLD may or may not represent the physical location of which phishing server was actually hosted, however. Some nation’s TLDs are only able to be registered by its citizens, so it is possible that this variable is a better measure of cybercriminal location than is spam rate.</p>

<sec id="section15-0894439311422689">
<title>Analytic Plan</title>
<p>Initially, a zero-order correlation matrix will be computed for most variables considered. It will be important to determine the relationships among the variables before controlling for spurious factors. It will also be a precaution to investigate potential multicollinearity issues.</p>
<p>Both DVs are represented as count data based on a rate: spam per population size and phishing TLDs per population size. Therefore, regression models that utilize count data as an outcome measure and that assume a Poisson distribution are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25a-0894439311422689">Long, 1997</xref>). While Poisson regression is the most basic model for count-based data, it is often not appropriate for the social sciences because its assumptions of equidispersion, or the variance being equal to the mean on average, are often violated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894439311422689">Lawless, 1987</xref>). Instead, data tend to be overdispersed, where variance exceeds the mean for the count-based data. This is the case for both spam and phishing data used in this research, and therefore a negative binomial regression model is used instead of Poisson regression, as negative binomial regression does not make this assumption and is intended to better fit the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894439311422689">Gardner, Mulvey, &amp; Shaw, 1995</xref>). Two separate regression models will be produced, one for each DV (count of spam and phishing servers). Negative binomial regression is also appropriate for count data that are based on a rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439311422689">Frome, 1983</xref>). For both regression models, nation population size will be used as the exposure variable, so that the outcome measure will be treated as a rate of spam/phishing attacks per person in the population.</p>

<title>Questions and Hypotheses</title>
<p>The research questions of this article concern the three main predictor variables, Internet users per capita, unemployment rate, and participation in the Convention on Cybercrime international treaty. The questions concern whether any of these three variables will be shown to impact either spam or phishing output that is associated with each country.</p>
<p>There are two hypotheses regarding these three variables: (a) countries with more Internet users per capita will have higher spam output and (b) countries with higher unemployment, controlling for Internet users, will have a higher spam output. Countries with more Internet users are assumed to have more suitable targets, that being Internet-ready computers (from which to install spambots on). Internet users could also be a measure of motivated offenders (as cybercriminals, no doubt, are Internet users). It is possible that countries with a higher unemployment also have higher unemployment for those with IT backgrounds. So long as Internet users are controlled for, so that two countries have an equal number of Internet users, but unequal unemployment, the country with high unemployment may have bigger problems with spam. This is hoped to be a measure of motivated offenders, as an Internet user might be more motivated to profit from cybercrime, were there few legal economic opportunities available.</p>
<p>Note that the hypotheses are predicting spam output, not phishing TLD output (which is the second DV). While spam is thought to originate from botnets and other spam sending servers, it is less clear how phishing TLDs relate to location. Some countries do not require citizenship to register a TLD associated with them, so the fact that a TLD represents a location (a country) is purely artificial. Therefore, there is no prediction regarding the phishing TLD variable.</p>
<p>The question concerning cybercrime laws is not as certain, which is hoped to be a measure of capable guardians. There are significant limitations of this measure, considering only 11 nonmember states have participated in the treaty’s creation. Even were there no limitations, the impact of this variable on spam would still not be clear. Perhaps countries high in anticybercrime laws suppress criminal activity better and therefore cybercrime law is inversely related to cybercrime rates. However, it could also be considered probable that countries with high rates of cybercrime activities have more cause to legislate anticybercrime laws. So, perhaps cybercrime laws are shown to increase cybercrime rates. Whatever the case, cybercrime laws that exist within a country are considered a wildcard and their effects appear difficult to predict.</p>

<p>As is expected, more Internet users per capita are positively associated with both spam (<italic>r</italic> = .73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and phishing (<italic>r</italic> = .57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) rates.

High cybercrime nations tend to be wealthier.</p>
<p>The Convention on Cybercrime variables seems to be mostly related to cybercrime in a predictable direction. Nations that have not participated in the Convention on Cybercrime (CC not participant variable) tend to have lower spam (<italic>r</italic> = −.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and phishing (<italic>r</italic> = −.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) rates. Whereas nations that have signed (CC signed variable) or ratified (CC ratified variable) are positively and significantly associated with both spam and phishing rates. Nations that have participated but not signed the Convention on Cybercrime (CC participant variable) do not show a significant effect. Considering the small sample size relative to the total number of predictors for regression, the four dummies were converted into a single dichotomous variable to cut back on the number of predictors.

<p>Unemployment is no longer related to spam after controlling for spurious factors. However, the interaction between Internet users and unemployment is significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The effect of Internet users on spam is conditional on a nation’s unemployment rate. The interaction suggests that the relationship between Internet users and spam is strongest in countries with high unemployment. It may be that unemployment motivates offenders to commit crime, but it could also mean that the unemployed spend more time online (and are more likely to be victims).</p>
<p>Nations with higher GDP per capita are also associated with more spam. A 1 <italic>SD</italic> unit increase in GDP per capita predicts a 1.9 increase in the expected count of spam sent (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), controlling for other predictors. Wealthier nations send more spam, even when Internet users per capita are held constant. Population size and whether a nation participated in the Convention on Cybercrime (d_Participant) are not significant. The Convention on Cybercrime variable was biased in favor of European countries and is not significant with the continent of Europe included as a dummy variable. Without the continent dummy indicators, d_Participant was actually significant (not shown in table). It was therefore fortunate to have controlled for continent.</p>
<p>However, the only continent that is significantly related to spam is North America. North America is associated with more spam, relative to the reference category, which is Africa. North America is likely significant because the spam bait addresses were all collected on English-speaking websites and received within the United States of America. Of all cases, America received the most spam. The regression model was rerun once with the U.S. case removed (not shown in table), and the significance and coefficient signs were all the same as with the United States included. Interestingly, even North America is still significant with the United States removed.</p>

<p>Unemployment is now positively associated with phishing attacks, whereas before with bivariate correlation the relationship was negative. A 1 <italic>SD</italic> unit increase in unemployment predicts a 1.63 increase in the expected count of phishing TLDs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The reversing of the sign for unemployment suggests a suppression effect. It was determined in other regression models (not shown) that adding either Internet users per capita or GDP per capita reverses the sign of unemployment. For example, when two nations are equal in terms of wealth or Internet access, the nation having higher unemployment will actually have more phishing TLDs associated with it.</p>
<p>The interaction between Internet users and unemployment is not significant, however, in contrast with the spam model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894439311422689">Table 2</xref>. GDP per capita is related such that a 1 <italic>SD</italic> unit increase in GDP per capita predicts a 2.78 increase in the expected count of phishing TLDs associated with that country, controlling for all else in the model (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Whether a nation participated in the Convention on Cybercrime (d_Participant) is not related to phishing. Interestingly, population size is now significant (whereas it was not in the correlation table), but still inversely related to phishing.</p>
<p>More of the continents are significant predictors of phishing than they are for spam. Most are shown to have more phishing TLDs associated with them relative to Africa. Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Oceania have significantly more phishing TLDs associated with them than Africa. North America and the Middle East are not shown to be associated with more phishing TLDs relative to Africa.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This research has attempted to measure the three conditions of RAT (offender, target, and guardian) at the national level and how that might relate to certain cybercrime variables. Suitable targets were intended to be captured by Internet users per capita, hopefully relating to the number of computers from which to send spam or host servers. Motivated offenders were intended to be measured by high rates of unemployment, as lack of employment may be a motivator to commit crime. Finally, participation in the Convention on Cybercrime was hoped to measure law enforcement or capable guardians.</p>
<p>The three research questions relate to these three variables: (a) Does the number of Internet users relate to cybercrime? (b) Does high unemployment relate to cybercrime? and (c) Does anticybercrime legislation relate to cybercrime? It was hypothesized that the variables of the first two questions are positively associated with spam. This research has found some support for the first two questions, but not the third.</p>
<sec id="section22-0894439311422689">
<title>Predictors of Spam Rates</title>
<p>The percentage of the population that are Internet users was positively associated with spam, as predicted. The number of Internet users ought to relate to the number of Internet-ready computers available in a given nation. The number of these computers can possibly translate into the number of potential hosts for malware, such as botnets that send spam. The Internet users themselves can also be targets of cybercriminals, as they are often needed to click malicious links or buy fraudulent spamvertised goods. Internet users can also mean more motivated offenders as well, as it seem necessary that spammers use the Internet.</p>
<p>Unemployment was not significantly related to spam activity alone. However, the interaction involving unemployment and Internet users on spam was significant. It seems the effect of Internet users on spam-sending activity is stronger in countries with high unemployment. One interpretation of this is that nations with many Internet users with IT backgrounds but few IT jobs to seek employment with could be more motivated to make money from illegal means, such as sending spam. That is, if it can be assumed that unemployment rates affect those with IT jobs. As unemployment tends to relate to street crime, especially property crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894439311422689">Raphael &amp; Winter-Ebmer, 2001</xref>), it could also have similar effects on cybercrime. However, this would suggest that the measure of spam used actually represents where spammers physically reside, rather than where spambots are located or what IP addresses spammers choose when falsifying headers. It cannot be certain the relationship between where spam is sent from and where spammers live. Another explanation is that unemployed Internet users have more time to spend online, and therefore are more likely to be exposed to cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>Although only a control variable, GDP per capita was positively associated with spam. That is, wealthier nations send more spam. Wealthier nations probably have better technology and more Internet-ready computers (regardless of the number of Internet users). It is also known that individuals with higher socioeconomic status perceive there to be fewer risks online and subsequently spend more time using the Internet and making online purchases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894439311422689">Reisig, Pratt, &amp; Holtfreter, 2009</xref>). More time online means a heightened probability of being the recipient of a malware threat. GDP could potentially be a measure of suitable targets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0894439311422689">
<title>Predictors of Phishing TLD Rates</title>
<p>Contrary to the first question, Internet users per capita did not relate to whether phishing servers use that nation’s country code as a TLD. This may suggest that Internet-ready computers do not relate to phishing server domain registrations because the servers themselves may not be just any Internet user’s computer, as is the case for spambots. Instead, phishing servers may relate to the quantity of website hosting services, something of which this research did not control for. It could also be that phishing TLDs are in no way related to where a phishing server is located.</p>
<p>The interaction involving unemployment was not significant, but employment itself was. Employment was positively associated with phishing TLDs. Additionally, employment was inversely related to phishing without controls, but adding either Internet users or GDP reversed the sign of the relationship. This has similar implications as the significant interaction found for spam rates as the outcome. Higher unemployment means more phishing TLDs associated with the highly unemployed country, when either GDP or Internet users is controlled for.</p>
<p>Interestingly, population size was inversely related to phishing TLDs in the regression model, whereas it was not significantly related when just zero-order correlations were conducted (<italic>p</italic> = .07). It is unclear why this may be.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0894439311422689">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The two outcome measures have some limitations. Both are not measures that can confidently be assumed to represent cybercriminal country of origin. Ideally, these measures would represent the cybercriminal’s location, but the next best thing would be the cyberattack location. There is a chance that much of the spam data represent cyberattack location or where spambots, botnets, or servers used to send spam are located. However, the IP addresses assumed to be the location from which spam is sent can be spoofed, but it is not certain how much is falsified in this way.</p>
<p>The phishing TLD variable is also not clearly a representation of where a cybercriminal resides or where a phishing server is located. Some countries require citizenship status in order to register one of their nation’s TLDs. However, other nations do not require this. These differences may have affected the findings.</p>
<p>Unemployment may not have been a valid measure of unemployment for those with IT skills. There is some evidence to link unemployment of those with IT skills to cybercrime, such as unemployed hackers surveyed at hacking conventions having carried out more computer intrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894439311422689">Bachmann, 2010</xref>) and former company IT insiders hacking their former employers after being fired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32a-0894439311422689">Schell &amp; Melnychuk, 2011</xref>). However, it is not known whether unemployment rates affect all professions equally, whether with IT backgrounds or not.</p>
<p>It is also possible that many of those who send spam and conduct phishing attacks do not have formal training in computer science or other related IT skills. One sample of software crackers found that most did not in fact have these backgrounds in their employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439311422689">Goode &amp; Cruise, 2006</xref>). Much of the crimeware available today also reduces the skill required to conduct cyberattacks, and there are many user-friendly crimeware applications that can be set up with little skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894439311422689">Stevens, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894439311422689">Trend Micro, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, there is some selection bias in which countries were used. Listwise deletion removed all nations with any missing data points. This likely, systematically, excluded countries that have less data on them for whatever reasons. Less well-known countries that may be poorer, less technologically advanced, or have other differences, may have less data on them. Many nations low in cybercrime activity might have been excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0894439311422689">
<title>Suggestions for Future Research</title>
<p>Probably, the variable used in this research which has the most room for improvement would be the measure of anticybercrime legislation. It seems pretty clear that the measure is biased in favor of European countries and possibly is one of the reasons the predictor was not significant. Future research should opt for a better measure, such as the length of existing laws on cybercrime per country or the number of convictions of cybercrime offenders. The number of convictions would likely be the better measure of legal capable guardians.</p>
<p>Additional variables should also be considered, such as the number of Internet-ready computers or the number of individuals with IT-related degrees, both of which may be spuriously related to Internet users per capita. Internet-ready computers could be a better measure of suitable targets than Internet users, because spambots require infected machines more than they require users willing to click malicious links. The number of IT jobs per capita would also be a better measure of motivated offenders than the rate of unemployment.</p>
<p>For phishing TLDs, a second dichotomous variable representing whether the nation has citizenship requirements for registering their TLD would be useful. Excluding countries that do not have this requirement could also be an option. Of course, other measures of phishing could also be used, such as phishing server location. Future research might also want to create a crowding measure, such as population size per square kilometer, to perhaps help identify why population size is inversely related to phishing TLD rates.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In some circumstances, high unemployment may actually increase cybercrime activity within a given nation. If unemployment has any causal impact on cybercrime rates, maybe due to unemployed IT professionals, then the solution seems obvious but highly difficult to implement. That is, create more IT jobs. That is, however, easier said than done.</p>
<p>If the number of Internet users per capita is associated with more spam being sent from within that country, then perhaps better protective technology is required. Spambots require Internet capable machines, so better immunization of each machine from infection might yield a better outcome. However, it does not take research to motivate the creation of IT security tools. Such development is occurring at its own, quite rapid, pace.</p>
