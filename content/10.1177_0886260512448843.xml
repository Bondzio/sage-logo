<abstract>
<p>Undergraduate volunteers (<italic>n</italic> = 134) were randomly assigned in a 2 × 2 design that manipulated type of crime (rape vs. robbery) and perpetrator motivation (anger vs. desire). After reading one of the crime scenarios, participants responded to a series of attitude items regarding responsibility for the crime, assigned blame to agents mentioned in the scenario, and assigned a prison sentence to the perpetrator. A two-way ANOVA showed a significant interaction of motivation and crime (<italic>p</italic> = .026), with the victim rated least responsible in the anger-motivated rape scenario. Likewise, the assignment of blame produced a significant interaction of motivation and crime (<italic>p</italic> = .034); the victim was blamed the least in the anger-motivated rape scenario. Although the perpetrator was viewed as more responsible for the crime of rape than robbery (<italic>p</italic> = .022) and received a significantly longer sentence for rape (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), perpetrator motivation did not affect perceptions of the perpetrator’s responsibility for either crime. These results stand in contrast to those of Mitchell, Angelone, Kohlberger, and Hirschman (2009) and suggest their findings may have been the result of homophobic statements by the perpetrator rather than anger per se.</p>

<body>
<p>It seems axiomatic that the perpetrator of a crime is to blame for the commission of the crime. For the crime of rape, particularly, researchers have found that blame assignment is not clear-cut and can be affected by a variety of factors related to the victim, the perpetrator, and the person assigning the blame. Classically, victim characteristics and behaviors have been shown to influence participants’ views of the crime. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512448843">Mitchell, Angelone, Kohlberger, and Hirschman (2009)</xref> showed that perpetrator motivation can alter the degree of blame assigned to the victim and the perpetrator. It is unclear, however, if those results extend beyond the crime of rape and which aspects of the perpetrator’s motivation may be critical.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886260512448843">
<title>Victim Characteristics</title>
<p>Rape victims with a history of sexual “promiscuity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512448843">L’Armand &amp; Pepitone, 1982</xref>), those dressed in a provocative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512448843">Lewis &amp; Johnson, 1989</xref>), and women who had been drinking alcohol prior to an assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512448843">Sims, Noel, &amp; Maisto, 2007</xref>) were more likely to be viewed as contributing to the crime. In each case, the variable of interest can be viewed as within the control of the victim and present the victim as more enticing or sexually receptive. Moreover, men generally assign more blame to female rape victims than do women (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512448843">Calhoun, Selby, &amp; Warring, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512448843">Kleinke &amp; Myer, 1990</xref>). Collectively, these studies suggest that participants view the crime of rape as, at least partially, motivated by sex. Data regarding the role of personal attractiveness of the victim in blame assignment, however, provide a less clear picture.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512448843">Best and Demmin (1982)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512448843">Seligman, Brickman, and Koulack (1977)</xref> failed to find a relationship between victim attractiveness and participants’ attribution of blame for the victim’s rape. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512448843">Calhoun, Selby, Cann, and Keller (1978)</xref> found that attractive victims were perceived as more responsible for their rape, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512448843">Thornton and Ryckman (1983)</xref> reported that they were viewed as less responsible. At the least, these studies suggest that sexual motivation by the perpetrator is not straightforward. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512448843">Thornton and Ryckman (1983)</xref> provide some insight into the varying results by noting the more complex methodology for studies using victim attractiveness. Unlike many studies that rely on written descriptions of victim characteristics and behavior, studies of attractiveness must employ photographs that introduce a complex independent variable and one that may make replication difficult. Their extensive study builds a strong case that physically attractive victims are viewed as less responsible for the crime (and unattractive victims as more responsible). They argue that participants may reason that unattractive women are unlikely victims and must have done something (e.g., acted in a provocative manner) to precipitate the crime.</p>
<p>The arguments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512448843">Thornton and Ryckman (1983)</xref> are also consistent with the broader conceptualization of victim-blaming known as the just-world hypothesis. According to this view, social outcomes align with actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512448843">Lerner, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512448843">Lerner &amp; Simmons, 1966</xref>). If someone is victimized by a criminal, then they have likely contributed in some way. In studies of rape, the victim’s clothing, prior sexual behavior, and provocative manner are seen as contributing factors. Attractive women cannot control their appearance and are viewed as less responsible, if they are raped. It is important to note, however, that participants view attractive women as more likely to become victims (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512448843">DeJong, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512448843">Seligman, et al., 1977</xref>), again suggesting that they envision a role for sexual motivation in rape.</p>

<sec id="section2-0886260512448843">
<title>Perpetrator Characteristics</title>
<p>Few studies have investigated directly the role of perpetrator motivation in assignment of blame. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512448843">Selby, Calhoun, and Cann (1979)</xref> used a factorial design to assess “psychological conflict” versus a brain tumor and sexual versus aggressive motivation with regard to the degree of blame assigned to the rapist and the extent of punishment (in their study the rapist was caught and subsequently confessed to the crime). Participants blamed the psychologically conflicted rapist more and assigned him a longer prison term; the motivational variable affected only the prison term, with aggressively motivated rapists receiving longer sentences. The authors did not ask participants for their views of the victim, and although it may be reasonable to believe there is a symmetrical relationship between blame for the rapist and blame for the victim, that is not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512448843">Mitchell et al. (2009)</xref> focused on the role of perpetrator motivation and its potential effect on participants’ views of the responsibility of the victim, responsibility of the perpetrator, and proposed sentence. Specifically, they examined whether a rapist motivated by a desire for sexual intercourse would be treated differently than one motivated by anger. In half the scenarios, the victims were male, in half they were female; the rapist was a male in all cases. The authors found that victims received less blame, perpetrators received more blame, and that participants meted out longer sentences if a rapist were motivated by anger rather than sexual desire. However, in that study, anger was expressed in homophobic terms (perpetrator stated he knew the victim was a homosexual and was going to give them what they deserved); the authors acknowledged that it was unclear if measured differences were due to the perpetrator’s anger or the perpetrator’s stated dislike of homosexuals.</p>

<sec id="section3-0886260512448843">
<title>Beyond Rape</title>
<p>Compared with rape, there is a dearth of empirical victimization studies that focus on murder or robbery. Murder has been studied in its own right (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512448843">Freeman, 2006</xref>) and is sometimes combined with rape (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512448843">Hoiberg &amp; Stires, 1973</xref>). Direct comparisons of violent and nonviolent crime are not common and the outcomes have not been consistent.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512448843">Barnett and Field (1978)</xref> compared the effects of victim and perpetrator characteristics in rape and burglary. While replicating past findings for rape, they showed that burglary was little affected by these variables. In contrast, researchers have found that victims of robbery who behaved atypically prior to victimization were blamed more than those who did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512448843">Graves &amp; Lowe, 1983</xref>); a finding that is consistent with a similar study of rape victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512448843">Turley, Sanna, &amp; Reiter, 1995</xref>). The overall degree of perpetrator blame has been shown by some to be higher for the crime of rape than theft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512448843">Brems &amp; Wagner, 1994</xref>), while others have not replicated that difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512448843">van den Bos &amp; Maas, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study sought to clarify the role of perpetrator motivation and to widen the investigation beyond the crime of rape. We used a randomized design to investigate two crimes (rape vs. robbery) and two levels of perpetrator motivation (anger vs. desire). We hypothesized that participants would assign more blame and a longer prison sentence to the perpetrator, and less blame to the victim, in the anger scenarios and that the greatest blame for the perpetrator (and the least for the victim) will be seen with the anger-motivated rape scenarios. Past research offers little to direct hypotheses regarding blame for rape versus robbery, but we hypothesized that the rapist would be assigned a longer sentence than the robber, based on the harm produced by the crime.</p>

<sec id="section5-0886260512448843">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were volunteers (<italic>n</italic> = 134) from undergraduate psychology classes at a private school in the northeast. They varied in age from 18 to 25 (<italic>M</italic> = 19.4); there were 38 males and 92 females (4 unreported). Most were freshmen (<italic>n</italic> = 63), but other ranks were represented (sophomores = 30, juniors = 20, seniors = 21). Self-reported ethnic background showed the participant pool was mostly “white or of European ancestry” (<italic>n</italic> = 105); the next largest group was “Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish ancestry” (<italic>n</italic> = 16), followed by “black or of African descent” (<italic>n</italic> = 5), “Eastern or of Asian ancestry (<italic>n</italic> = 3); eight reported “other” or did provide an answer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886260512448843">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>The materials consisted of a packet divided into three sections: demographics, a brief crime report, and the participant measures. The demographics section queried respondents about age, sex, scholastic status, major, and whether they had completed a high school psychology course.</p>
<sec id="section7-0886260512448843">
<title>Crime reports</title>
<p>Four crime reports were developed, based on those used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512448843">Mitchell et al. (2009)</xref>. Each report was broken into three sections: alleged victim, alleged offense, and alleged offender. The alleged victim is described identically in all four reports. The victim was a 24-year-old female named Alex who attended a university in the northeast and received a degree in communications and is now a graduate student at that same (unnamed) university; she lives five blocks from campus. There were also details about her family. There were four different descriptions for the alleged offense, but in all cases the perpetrator and the victim had been at the campus library and the crime was committed in a nearby wooded area. The perpetrator was a large man approximately 6’2”, 250 lbs. who grabbed Alex from behind and threw her to the ground. He then made a statement to Alex, thereby revealing his motivation. In both rape scenarios he said, “I saw you in the library tonight and thought you were hot”; in the desire-motivated rape scenario he goes on to say that he needs to have sex “no matter what it takes”; in the anger-motivated rape he says that “bitches like you really piss me off and so I’m going to teach you a lesson.” In both cases, he then sexually penetrated her and ultimately ran away.</p>
<p>In both robbery scenarios, the perpetrator states, “I saw you in the library tonight—you look like you’re rich”; in the desire-motivated robbery scenario he added that “I’m really hurtin’ these days—I need money in a bad way”; in the anger-motivated robbery he makes the same statement as in the anger-motivated rape. In both robbery scenarios, he demanded the victim’s laptop computer and cell phone and ran away after receiving the items.</p>
<p>The alleged offender is later identified by police as P. Robert, a 25-year-old graduate student at the same university Alex attends. In all four crime reports, he admits seeing Alex in the library. In the rape scenarios, he contends that the sex was consensual; in the robbery scenarios, he states that they chatted, but he had no other contact with Alex.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886260512448843">
<title>Participant measures</title>
<p>There were five components to the participant measures: recall of crime report details, role of the perpetrator, role of the victim, suggested prison sentence, and blame points. The recall component posed five multiple-choice questions about the crime reports (e.g., location of the crime). The role of the perpetrator was assessed with four items (Do you believe that Robert is responsible for the crime that was committed? Did Robert have a choice of whether to commit the crime? Do you believe that Robert caused the crime to occur? To what extent is Robert to blame for the crime that was committed?); each was measured on a scale of 1 to 7, with item-specific anchors for the high and low options. The role of the victims was assessed in the same manner, except the item stems pertaining to the victim (Do you believe that Alex is responsible for the crime that was committed? Could Alex have anticipated that she would be victimized that evening? Do you believe that Alex caused the crime to occur? To what extent is Alex to blame for the crime that was committed?). The proposed prison sentence item was open-ended, with a range of 6 months to 25 years, assuming the perpetrator was found guilty. Finally, participants were asked to distribute 25 “blame points” to five possible contributors to the crime: Alex, Robert, the university groundskeepers, the library staff, and the campus police. There were no restrictions on the assignment of points except that the total should equal 25.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260512448843">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All participants signed a statement of informed consent prior to receiving a packet containing the demographics questionnaire, one of the four scenarios (randomly determined), and a two-sided sheet of participant measures. The participant measures were configured in eight arrangements, such that half the role assessments began with items about Robert and half with items about Alex. These were further divided such that half began with the recall task and half with the assignment of blame points. The proposed sentence always followed immediately the assignment of blame points. In half the packets the role assessment was on the front of the page; in half, it was on the back. Each scenario was systematically associated with each of the eight configurations of the participant measures.</p>
<p>There was no time limit for competition of data collection, but in the vast majority of cases the participants were finished in less than 20 min. Each participant received a debriefing script after returning the packet.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886260512448843" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Only those participants correctly answering four or five of the recall items were deemed sufficiently engaged by the study to warrant inclusion in the data analysis. A total of 19 participants were excluded on this basis and the subsequent analyses were undertaken with <italic>n</italic> = 115.</p>
<p>Summary measures for the victim-role and perpetrator-role surveys were derived by principal components analyses with varimax rotation, factor Eigenvalues greater than 1.0, and an item loading cutoff criterion of 0.50. Two components were identified for Alex and one for Robert. The first component for Alex was constituted from two items and accounted for 50.2% of the variance. This component was subsequently labeled <italic>victim responsibility</italic> based on the focus of the items (Alex is responsible for the crime and caused it). The second component produced no significant outcomes and was discarded. For Robert, the single component accounted for 77.3% of the variance. This component encompassed all four items and was subsequently labeled <italic>perpetrator responsibility</italic>.</p>
<p>A two-way ANOVA showed no main effect for type of crime or type of motivation on victim responsibility. However, a significant interaction of motivation and crime was observed, with <italic>F</italic>(1, 106) = 5.13, <italic>p</italic> = .026. The victim was rated least responsible in the anger-motivated rape scenario (all means and standard deviations are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512448843">Table 1</xref>). Analysis of perpetrator responsibility showed a significant main effect for type of crime, with <italic>F</italic>(1, 108) = 8.06, <italic>p</italic> = .005. The perpetrator was viewed as more responsible for the crime of rape than the crime of robbery. However, there was no main effect of motivation, nor was there an interaction between crime and motivation.</p>

<p>Analysis of the blame points assigned to Alex and Robert revealed the same pattern of outcome as the summary measures. A two-way ANOVA of the points assigned to Alex produced no main effect of crime or motivation, but there was a significant interaction between the two, with <italic>F</italic>(1, 111) = 4.63, <italic>p</italic> = .034. The fewest number of points was assigned in the anger-motivated rape scenario. As above, there was a main effect of crime revealed by the blame points assigned to Robert, with <italic>F</italic>(1, 111) = 5.40, <italic>p</italic> = .022. Again, the greatest blame was associated with the crime of rape, but there was neither a main effect of motivation nor an interaction between crime and motivation.</p>
<p>We analyzed the proposed sentence for Robert based on the open-ended assignment of a prison term. On average, participants recommended a sentence of 2.94 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.62) in the robbery scenario and a sentence of 13.54 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.88) in the rape scenarios, with <italic>F</italic>(1, 109) = 91.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Sentences did not vary systematically with motivation nor did crime and motivation interact for this measure.</p>
<p>In addition, we used <italic>t</italic> tests to assess differences in the dependent variables that might exist between male and female participants. None of the outcomes rose to the point of significance.</p>
<p>Finally, we determined the one-tailed correlation between blame for the victim and blame for the perpetrator for the two dependent measures as well as the correlation between sentence and the two measures of blame for the perpetrator. There was a significant relationship between victim and perpetrator blame regardless of measure; the Likert-type items produce a slightly lower coefficient than the blame-points approach, with <italic>r</italic>(107) = –.241, <italic>p</italic> = .006 and <italic>r</italic>(113) = –.309, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively. Similarly, both measures produced a significant correlation between perpetrator blame and sentence; again, the Likert-type items produce a slightly lower coefficient than the blame-points approach, with <italic>r</italic>(111) = .248, <italic>p</italic> = .005 and <italic>r</italic>(113) = .295, <italic>p</italic> = .001, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present results demonstrate that perpetrator motivation can affect judgments of criminal responsibility. These results confirm and extend those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512448843">Mitchell et al. (2009)</xref>. However, the present study suggests a more complex picture than observed by Mitchell et al. or than anticipated prior to this study. Perpetrator motivation did not produce any significant effects of its own but rather revealed itself in an interaction with the crime. Two different analyses showed the victim was blamed least in the anger-motivated rape scenarios. This is consistent with the findings of Mitchell et al. However, we did not find that the significant shift in responsibility away from the victim was accompanied by significantly increased blame for the perpetrator (cf. Mitchell et Al.), despite a significant negative correlation between the two. Instead, we found the perpetrator was blamed more for the rape than the robbery and assigned a greater sentence for the rape than the robbery, but perpetrator motivation did not play a role in either assessment.</p>
<p>The obvious explanation for differences in the outcomes between this study and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512448843">Mitchell et al. (2009)</xref> is related to the manner in which the anger was expressed. The addition of homophobic terms in their study may have generated sufficiently greater distaste for the perpetrator to produce a significant outcome. Alternatively, it could be that the participants did not find the aggressive motivation credible here (i.e., that someone would rape a women simply to teach her a lesson) or it did not overcome their view that rape is sexually motivated.</p>
<p>All four scenarios were derived from those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512448843">Mitchell et al. (2009)</xref>, but our attempt to alleviate their conundrum may have lead to descriptions that lacked comparability or credibility. Rape and robbery differ in many ways and the remarks by the perpetrators may have complicated matters. For example, the desirous robber might have engendered a degree of sympathy that would be highly unlikely in a rape scenario. Participants may not believe that a person would commit either crime motivated simply by anger—or anger alone. Future research would be helped by the addition of a manipulation check to determine the degree to which participants found the scenarios believable.</p>
<p>A second limitation of the present study was the use of a predominantly female, undergraduate participant pool. While similar to the constituents of other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512448843">Brems &amp; Wagner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512448843">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512448843">van den Bos &amp; Maas, 2009</xref>), the results may not reflect the views of demographically disparate groups. In addition, the victim and setting of the scenarios may have been particularly poignant for the female participants. Analyses of male and female responses, however, revealed only nonsignificant differences in the dependent measures. It is an open question whether use of a noncollege setting in the scenario or use of nonstudent participants would have altered the outcomes.</p>
<p>The finding of greater perpetrator blame for the crime of rape is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512448843">Brems and Wagner (1994)</xref>, but stands in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512448843">van den Bos and Maas (2009)</xref>. It should be noted, however, that these statistical differences are based on small mean differences. Here, and with Brems and Wagner, perpetrator blame far outweighs both victim blame and the differences observed across crimes.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind the relative nature of blame assignment in all studies of this type. Participants do not assign the bulk of the blame to the victim, but rather the degree of blame assigned to the victim and the perpetrator shifts away from finding the victim blameless and away from finding the perpetrator wholly responsible. Our results show a significant correlation between the victim and perpetrator blame, but also reveal that the relationship accounts for little of the variance. Likewise, perpetrator blame is significantly correlated with sentence, but again it accounts for only a small portion of the variance. These findings suggest that the processes underlying assignment of blame are largely independent of those for assigning a prison sentence. Blame assignment is a cognitive process akin to establishing causality; sentencing reflects societal and personal valuation of harm, generally linked with motives such as deterrence and retribution. The present results do not reveal a major role for perpetrator motivation in either process.</p>
