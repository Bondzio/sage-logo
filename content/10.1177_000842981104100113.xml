<p>This volume investigates “the influence of the Book of Revelation and the apocalypse more generally on various sites within popular culture, tracing the way in which its themes, language and motifs are manifested across film and music and in literary and online texts.” It contains an introduction by the editors, and nine essays: “Songs of Fate, Hope and Oblivion: Bob Dylan’s Dystopianism and Apocalypticism” (Gary Baines), “End of World Music: Is Extreme Metal the Sound of the Apocalypse?” (Keith Kahn-Harris), “Babylon’s Burning: Reggae, Rastafari and Millenarianism” (Christopher Partridge), “Apocalypse at the Millennium” (John Walliss), “‘These Days Are Numbered’: The Romance of Death, Doom, and Deferral in Contemporary Apocalypse Films” (Lee Quinby), “Making Things New: Regeneration and Transcendence in Anime” (Mick Broderick), “Selling Faith without Selling Out: Reading the <italic>Left Behind</italic> Novels in the Context of Popular Culture” (Jennie Chapman), “‘The Shadow of the End’: The Appeal of Apocalypse in Literary Science Fiction” (Roslyn Weaver), and “An End Times Virtual ‘Ekklesia’: Ritual Deliberation in Participatory Media” (Robert Glenn Howard).</p>
<p>The topic of apocalyptic thought in popular culture is not new. Over a dozen books have been published in the past five years alone, including Robert M. Geraci, <italic>Apocalyptic AI</italic>, William H. Katerberg, <italic>Future West</italic> (on apocalyptic science-fiction), David Janssen and Edward Whitelock, <italic>Apocalyptic Jukebox</italic>, Richard Landes, <italic>Heaven on Earth: The Varieties of the Millennial Experience</italic>, David J. Leigh, <italic>Apocalyptic Patterns in Twentieth-Century Fiction</italic>, Peter Y. Paik, <italic>From Utopia to Apocalypse</italic> (film/graphic novels), Elizabeth K. Rosen, <italic>Apocalyptic Transformation</italic> (novels/film/graphic novels), Kirsten M. Thompson, <italic>Apocalyptic Dread</italic> (film), and Roslyn Weaver, <italic>Apocalypse in Australian Fiction and Film</italic>. So the question is whether the volume under review has anything original to report. Despite the slightly dated quality of its essays (e.g., there is nothing on the “2012” phenomenon), the answer is “Yes.” Four essays in particular stand out, but all represent solid contributions to the field.</p>
<p>Christopher Partridge unpacks the significance of the “Babylon” motif in Rastafarian thought. One interpretation understands the Jewish exile in Babylon as a metaphor for the present-day situation of the Rastafarians, far from “Zion,” their African home. Another derives from the “Babylon” of the Revelation of John, a code word for the Roman Empire but later used to describe any form of oppressive government. Partridge explores how millennial expectations associated with the second, apocalyptic “Babylon” shaped Rastafarian history, memory, and identity, mainly through song lyrics, and particularly in the generation of the 1970s and 1980s, when it crossed over to punk and post-punk culture. A good example of this cross-over effect appears in William Gibson’s <italic>Neuromancer</italic>, the classic cyberpunk novel with no shortage of apocalyptic imagery. In it, there is a scene were Case, a cyber-cowboy, invites a Rastafarian named Aerol to experience the consensual hallucination of abstracted data known as cyberspace. After a few minutes Case returns Aerol’s consciousness to his body, and asks him what he saw. “Babylon,” replies the Rastafarian.</p>
<p>Roslyn Weaver examines the ongoing appeal of apocalyptic scenarios in science fiction literature. One reason, she argues, is the basic flexibility of the theme. For example, images of catastrophe can alleviate audience anxiety about the present and the future. (Here Weaver might have correlated her research with studies on the cathartic function of apocalyptic literature, beginning with Adela Yarbro Collins’s 1984 book <italic>Crisis and Catharsis: The Power of the Apocalypse</italic>.) Apocalyptic settings and images in science fiction also permit it to function as a “literature of interrogation.” As a result, Weaver contends that dystopias such as Andrew McGahan’s <italic>Underground</italic> (or Gibson’s <italic>Neuromancer</italic>, for that matter) operate as oblique critiques of present-day society, and thereby challenge prevailing cultural constructions.</p>
<p>According to Mick Broderick, scholarship on apocalyptic anime overlooks two key facts. First, apocalypticism is as much concerned with themes of renewal and regeneration as it is with those of nihilism and destruction. Second, Japanese religious traditions play a considerable part in the formation of apocalyptic anime. Broderick finds ample evidence for both proposals in <italic>Akira</italic>, Ōtomo Katsuhiro’s paradigmatic 1988 film, and in <italic>Spriggan</italic> (1998) and <italic>Appleseed</italic> (2004), two more recent anime not normally discussed in the literature. Broderick’s point about apocalyptic renewal and regeneration might be obvious to biblical scholars, but has been missed by his colleagues, and needed to be made. A minor drawback of this essay is its exclusive focus on anime. Although anime are often based on manga (comic-books), many of the details of the print originals do not survive translation to film. For example, the screen time of <italic>Akira</italic> is two hours, but the serialized manga from which it derives (which is available in English translation) extends over 2,000 print pages. The same calculus applies to <italic>Spriggan</italic> and <italic>Appleseed</italic>, as it does to other anime, such as Miyazaki Hayao’s post-apocalyptic classic, <italic>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</italic> (1984).</p>
<p>John Walliss reconsiders Conrad Ostwalt’s concept of the “desacralization of the apocalypse” in contemporary cinema. (In my view, this dialogue should be considered part of the larger and still ongoing debate on the secularization of apocalypticism, which began four decades ago in a series of articles by R. Alter, E. Rovit, N.A. Scott, and J.V. Schall, and was given its classical formulation in Amos Wilder’s 1971 essay “The Rhetoric of Ancient and Modern Apocalyptic,” <italic>Interpretation</italic> 25, 436–453.) Walliss argues that “desacralization” remains conceptually useful yet has several shortcomings. Among other things, it fails to account for the inversion of traditional notions in apocalyptic films, such as how the pending overthrow of society is replaced with “an explicit valorization of the contemporary social order.” This is a critical point. Apocalypticism is most associated with small, socially peripheral religious groups who consider themselves deprived or persecuted. For such groups, the imminent end of the world is both welcome and just. However, over the past generation, scholars have observed that members of large, core institutions, who on the whole are less inclined to overthrow the current social order, can also view the world through the lens of apocalypticism. Although more remains to be said about the social functions of apocalyptic cinema in this regard, Walliss’s essay is ground-breaking.</p>
<p>By concentrating on “the apocalypse” (the imminent and catastrophic end of the present state) instead of “apocalypticism” (the underlying worldview), this volume sidesteps problems of definition and taxonomy that plague similar studies.</p>
<p>In sum, this volume presents a fine collection of essays that will be useful to students and scholars in multiple disciplines. Libraries should take note.</p>
