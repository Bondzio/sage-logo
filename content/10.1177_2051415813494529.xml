<p>John Anderson was the archetypal product of the baby boomer years, born south of London, the eldest son of an ex-bomber pilot and a nurse who had emigrated from the West of Ireland. His formative years were parochial but following his time at a local primary school he broke the mould of tradition and progressed, as the only boy to have done so in 3 years, to grammar school.</p>
<p>John’s initial inclination was to the arts and, having studied history and languages to A level, he headed to Exeter University to read philosophy. A moment of reflection changed the course of his life. John left Exeter and drove bulldozers in a Fullers Earth works to help him afford to convert to medicine; he left for Bristol to start his 1<sup>st</sup> MB in 1973. He qualified 6 years later, decided to become a surgeon and took his fellowship in 1983, beginning, as many of us did, on rotational training programmes in general surgery. His time with Robin Williamson defined that John’s career was going to take a urological turn and, in 1987 having completed his ChM, he moved to Sheffield to gain specific urological training with John Williams. After 3 months in California, in 1991, he came back to Yorkshire to become the first consultant to be appointed with a specific remit to treat urological malignancy, especially the rising tide of early prostate cancer.</p>
<p>John’s initial consultant career is littered with examples of innovation many years ahead of their adoption as the norm in clinical practice. He established combined oncology clinics, became an oncological sub-specialist and set up a consortium for private practice, all in the early 90’s. His expertise in change management, and his easy, winning, charm made John a natural target for leadership to promulgate best practice throughout the NHS. He was one of the first regional cancer leads, was on the national steering group for sub-specialist oncological practice and one of the first chairman of the BAUS section of oncology. John was also a committed and dextrous surgeon, inspirational to his juniors whether they were wedded to urology as a career or not, and kind, considerate and compassionate to his patients who had surgical treatment of the highest quality at his hands.</p>
<p>John had an international reputation for his work in the field of hormonal therapy for advanced prostate cancer, he sat on European guidelines committees and advised the MRC, NCRI, CEPOD and PCAG about the management of urological pelvic malignancy. John was widely published in his field and sat on editorial boards of the BJUI and the national urological cancer guidance. He also devoted a lot of his time, since 2005, as a trustee of the Prostate Cancer charity and, subsequently, Prostate Cancer UK. His attempts to grow a reasonable ‘tash for Movember will be an enduring testimony to his commitment to try and help even when the odds were against him!</p>
<p>John’s persistence, firm fairness and invariable good humour meant that he was universally liked and respected. His inability to take up the Presidency of BAUS, as a consequence of the urological cancer to which he devoted so much time attempting to defeat, has meant that the speciality has lost out on the promise of one of the most engaging personalities to have achieved high office in the UK for many years.</p>
<p>John treated his final illness in the way that he approached virtually every other aspect of his life, straightforwardly and with a positive tilt at every bit of adversity. John’s many friends were inspired by the way he dealt with the initial uncertainty of his diagnosis, his decision to defer therapy until he became symptomatic and the inexorable decline in his health from the metastatic disease that was evident at the outset. John continued, after having retired from clinical practice, to beat the drum for prostate cancer awareness, telling his story to a tearful audience at the BAUS annual meeting in Glasgow, and writing about, and debating, his experiences on a very public stage.</p>
<p>John was a hugely entertaining man whose glass was always more than half full, both figuratively and literally. He loved balanced simplicity and had an informed view on almost everything, no matter how obscure the topic was. His love of spontaneous adventure was a facet of his character that those close to him will recognise as being instantly engaging, his rekindled love of motorcycling typifying the spirit that was uniquely John. John’s last year was filled with wonderful memories, shared with Sarah, his children and their first grandchild, Sebastian. Those memories were packed tightly into an existence that became increasingly restrictive in his last month. John was appreciative of the palliative care team who looked after him in his last days, surrounded by the family, and the wife, he adored. There may be others who will try to emulate John, but if anyone manages to recreate that wonderful balance of humour, empathy, fairness, and overriding positivity, they will be a unique person indeed.</p>
