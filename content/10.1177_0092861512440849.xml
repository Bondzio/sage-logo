               <italic>Background: </italic>Reviewers’ summaries and other documents routinely posted on the FDA website have been cited in published studies and by tertiary drug information resources. Because they can contain information otherwise undisclosed to the public, they could potentially replace certain data on file references in standard medical response letters. <italic>Objective: </italic>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether publicly available information from the FDA website (http://www.fda.gov) could reduce the need to use data on file as a reference in industry drug information service standard response letters. <italic>Methods: </italic>Eighty-six standard response letters for 4 drug products, containing 272 data on file references, were assessed to determine whether data on file could be replaced using online FDA medical reviews or advisory committee briefing documents. <italic>Results:</italic> Thirty-two percent (87/272) of data on file references were found to be replaceable with existing information on the FDA website. <italic>Conclusions: </italic>Online FDA resources may sometimes be used in lieu of data on file in standard medical response letters.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>In 2001, a pharmacist and physician from the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee at Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and 3 physicians from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver each wrote letters to the editor of the <italic>Journal of the American Medical Association</italic> (<italic>JAMA</italic>) protesting how a <italic>JAMA</italic>-published trial’s design and results were represented in the journal.<sup>

            </sup> Their assertion that the publication misrepresented the study was based on the different information about the study provided in the FDA reviewer’s summary, which they noted was publicly available on the FDA website. At that time, FDA reviewer summaries were a little-known and seldom-used resource for drug information. Since then, FDA reviewer summaries and other FDA data have been utilized in a variety of published studies, raising public awareness of their ready availability.<sup>

         </p>
         <p>Information from unpublished sources like new drug applications, biologic license applications, and safety reports is considered appropriate for use in industry drug information service standard medical response letters only on occasion.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512440849">10</xref>
            </sup> A standard medical response letter is a written reply to a frequently asked question, typically created and maintained as part of a library or database of ready responses, and tailored as appropriate for individual requests for medical information.<sup>

            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>When data on file are cited in a standard letter, it is considered important to be vigilant in seeking opportunities to replace it as publications become available.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512440849">11</xref>
            </sup> Most industry drug information services have policies governing the use of data on file.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512440849">11</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Limits are placed on the use of data on file for a variety of reasons. Revealing unpublished information can potentially jeopardize a company’s publication plans, marketing strategies, or investigator relationships.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512440849">10</xref>
            </sup> Perhaps even more important is the perception among clinicians that results attributed to data on file may not be valid because they are unable to obtain and assess the evidence themselves.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512440849">12</xref>
            </sup> In the United States, there is no legal obligation to provide data on file source documents if requested, and most companies do not because they consider the information proprietary or have an internal policy that prohibits its distribution.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512440849">12</xref>

         <p>We reasoned that if formulary decision makers, researchers, individual health care professionals, and compendia publishers were referencing the FDA website, then FDA website sources could also potentially be cited in industry drug information standard response letters. Using publicly available FDA sources instead of data on file could help to meet the industry standard of replacing data on file with public sources whenever possible and potentially improve the customer experience by increasing transparency. Our study evaluated whether FDA medical reviewer summaries and advisory committee briefing documents could replace data on file citations in a pharmaceutical company drug information department’s standard letter database.</p>

         <title>Materials and Methods</title>
         <p>The standard response letters for 4 products supported by an industry drug information service were examined to identify all letters containing any data on file citations. All data on file citations within the identified letters were then recorded and counted. Each data on file citation was assessed to see if it could be replaced with information from an online FDA medical review or advisory committee briefing document. To be considered replaceable, information from the FDA resource had to match that of the standard letter data on file citation exactly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861512440849">Figure 1</xref>. The success rate, defined as the number of data on file references replaceable with FDA information divided by the total number of data on file references, multiplied by 100%, was calculated for each of the 4 products.</p>

         <p>The most common types of data on file that were replaceable with FDA information were detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria from pivotal trials, information concerning study protocols, and rare adverse events. Products A and B, which had the highest success rates, were both subject to prior FDA advisory committee meetings, while products C and D were not. Products A and B were initially approved within the last 10 years; products C and D were approved &gt;10 years ago.</p>

      <sec id="section4-0092861512440849">
         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>Our study had a variety of limitations. One was that we evaluated only FDA medical reviews and briefing documents, when there may be additional relevant information on the FDA website or in other nonjournal public sources such as http://clinicaltrials.gov. For example, industry drug information services that do not routinely incorporate the contents of FDA safety alerts into their standard letters might find that these resources could replace a variety of data on file citations. Thus, we did not assess the utility of any and all FDA resources or any and all other resources for replacing data on file. Another limitation was that we only assessed the response letters for a sample of 4 products and did so using a retrospective analysis. Our results may have been influenced by the types of products we evaluated or by our method of study.</p>
         <p>Despite these limitations, we believe that the potential benefits of citing FDA resources in lieu of data on file warrant consideration of their use in pharmaceutical drug information services. One benefit of citing the FDA website instead of data on file in industry drug information service standard letters is that it would increase transparency and, in turn, potentially increase the perceived reliability or quality of the response documents. If a health care professional requested additional details or asked to have the reference sent, the drug information service could supply the public FDA source document. In addition, whereas data on file are used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, if FDA resources were treated like other public resources, additional findings and details from these resources could potentially be incorporated into standard letters. Together, we believe these changes have the potential to improve the customer experience when interacting with industry drug information services.</p>
         <p>Limitations of citing FDA reviewer summaries and advisory committee briefing documents in response letters include the variability in the availability of FDA sources for different products, the variability in the quality of FDA documents, and the lack of certainty about the web address for an FDA source over time. The difference in replaceable data on file references between product A and product C illustrates the variability in availability. The quality of FDA source documents also varies. Most advisory committee briefing documents are clean, relatively concise, searchable portable data files; however, FDA reviewer summaries may be lengthy and are often scanned, unsearchable copies. In FDA reviewer summaries from several years ago or more, in particular, pages may be omitted or individual lines of text redacted. Finally, the FDA can and periodically does refurbish its website and move sources. The exact web address for a resource today may not be valid years from now.</p>
         <p>Incorporating these resources into the routine workflow of an industry drug information service could also present challenges. When searching for information, the drug information specialist would have to remember this new and different source in addition to more traditional sources. In departments with thorough policies and procedures, developing new standard operating procedures for how and when to use FDA resources would require extra time and effort. Lastly, in those cases where an individual data point is initially only available in an FDA resource but later is published, using the FDA resource could represent an extra step before using the full publication, affecting overall workload. In some cases, several years could intervene between the availability of FDA advisory committee or review documents and full publication.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>In our study, approximately one third of all data on file citations from a sample of 86 industry drug information service standard response letters representing 4 drug products could be replaced using publicly available information from the FDA website. Using these sources instead of data on file references meets industry standards for limiting data on file reference use and may improve transparency for the clinician customers of industry drug information services. Several practical limitations may affect the usefulness of substituting data on file references with these sources.</p>
