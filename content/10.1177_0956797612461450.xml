<abstract>
<p>Neurologically intact adults perseverate in immediate serial recall, intruding items from a previous trial into the current response. We applied the electroencephalogram/event-related-potential subsequent-memory paradigm to immediate serial recall to investigate the causes of these errors. In line with previous studies using this paradigm, results revealed that words that were correctly recalled elicited a greater frontal positivity during encoding when compared with words that were either perseverated over or not produced for some other reason. More surprisingly, differences were also found at encoding between the words perseverated into the subsequent response and words that were not perseverated. These findings support a theory stating that abnormalities in both how the current target and the previous trial are processed can contribute to perseveration errors. These results inform existing theories of immediate serial recall and theories of the control of irrelevant information.</p>

<p>Across a range of cognitive tasks, the recent past remains active, priming—and sometimes even intruding into—subsequent responses. In this study, we investigated the intrusion of the past into the present—a phenomenon typically called perseveration error. These errors are observed across a range of tasks and populations. Previous research has focused primarily on perseverations produced by individuals with damaged brains (e.g., word perseverations in aphasia) or underdeveloped brains (e.g., A-not-B task with infants). In contrast, this study focused on perseverations that are commonly produced by unimpaired individuals in the context of an immediate-serial-recall (ISR) task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612461450">Conrad, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612461450">Estes, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612461450">Henson, 1999</xref>). Consider the two trial sequence from an ISR experiment shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612461450">Table 1</xref>. The “B” from the first trial (GJL<underline>B</underline>YH → GJL<underline>B</underline>YH) is perseverated into the second response (CMPVNF → CM<underline>B</underline>VNQ), replacing the target item, “P.” In the present research, we addressed the question: Why is the “B” perseverated?</p>

<p>Most theories of perseveration assume a problem with how the current trial is processed. As a part of normal processing, traces of items from recent trials remain available but are normally weaker than the traces for the items in the current trial. Occasionally, the current target items are weakly represented, which opens the door for items from previous trials to be selected and produced, thus causing perseveration. This account would therefore suggest that the “B” perseveration shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612461450">Table 1</xref> is caused by an abnormality in how the target item, “P,” is processed. Accounts of this type have been used to explain perseverations in aphasia (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612461450">Cohen &amp; Dehaene, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612461450">Martin &amp; Dell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612461450">Moses, Sheard, &amp; Nickels 2007</xref>), A-not-B errors in infancy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612461450">Diamond, Cruttenden, &amp; Neiderman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612461450">Smith, Thelen, Titzer, &amp; McLin, 1999</xref>), and perseverations in ISR (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612461450">Page &amp; Norris, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>But is a problem processing the current trial the only factor that contributes to perseveration? An alternative possibility exists, in which an abnormality in processing leaves an item from a previous trial highly activated after it is produced, for example, because of a failure in inhibitory processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612461450">Fischer-Baum &amp; Rapp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612461450">Hamilton &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612461450">Hauser, 1999</xref>). For the error shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612461450">Table 1</xref>, a problem in processing the “B” during the previous trial, rather than the “P” during the current trial, may lead to perseveration of the “B.” The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive; it is possible that abnormalities in both how the current and previous trials are processed contribute to the production of perseveration errors. Is there any evidence that previous-trial processing influences the likelihood of perseveration?</p>
<p>Understanding the causes of perseveration has clear implications for theories of cognitive control, particularly if the conclusions from this study generalize to other circumstances in which perseverations occur. Furthermore, understanding the causes of perseveration in ISR may provide a critical test for distinguishing competing theories of verbal short-term memory. Most theories of ISR assume that recall is carried out by the short-term memory system. A subset of these theories posits that information decays so rapidly that only the current list is represented and processed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612461450">Baddeley &amp; Hitch, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612461450">Botvinick &amp; Plaut, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612461450">Burgess &amp; Hitch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612461450">Page &amp; Norris, 1998</xref>). Because only the current list is available, these theories assume that perseverations are a consequence of alternative recall strategies, such as probing long-term memory, which are only used when the short-term-memory system fails to produce a response (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612461450">Dillon &amp; Thomas, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612461450">Page &amp; Norris, 1998</xref>). If traces of the previous trial cannot directly influence the response selected by the short-term memory system, perseverations cannot simply be the result of abnormal processing of items from a previous trial. Other theories propose that the short-term-memory system represents the current list alongside weaker traces of recent lists, and this allows those traces from previous lists to influence current recall (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612461450">Henson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612461450">Nairne, 2002</xref>). For these theories, abnormal processing during the previous trial can result in an overly strong memory trace of items from the previous list, which causes items from the past to perseverate.</p>
<p>In ISR, nearly all participants produce some perseveration errors. But the same participants mostly recall items correctly. Why are some items perseverated whereas others are not? We addressed this question with an electroencephalogram (EEG)/event-related-potential (ERP) back-sorting technique similar to the subsequent-memory paradigm commonly used to understand episodic memory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612461450">Friedman &amp; Johnson, 2000</xref>, for a review). EEG was continuously collected during the encoding phase of a serial-recall task and then sorted as a function of whether or not each item was later perseverated. This technique provided a clear advantage over behavioral data alone, which can reveal only when a perseveration error has occurred, not the prior events that caused the error. The EEG recorded during encoding was used to index how well an item was processed at points prior to recall, which allowed us to identify when differences in processing predicted subsequent perseveration.</p>
<p>Previous research using the subsequent-memory paradigm has repeatedly demonstrated that subsequent memory for an item can be predicted by the brain response to that item during encoding, though the technique has not been used previously to investigate ISR. Typically, ERP differences emerge 400 ms after the onset of the stimulus, with subsequently remembered items eliciting a greater positivity than subsequently forgotten items (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612461450">Friedman &amp; Johnson, 2000</xref>, for a review). Further work has moved beyond whether or not an item is recalled to focus on the different ways that items could be forgotten (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612461450">Gonsalves &amp; Paller, 2000</xref>). This work shows that activity at encoding can also predict later memory errors, such as source misattributions. The subsequent-memory paradigm can be used to identify the timing of events that are predictive of accurate memory, as well as memory errors.</p>
<p>Following existing theories of perseveration, we looked for differences in ERPs at two time points, time-locked to the presentation of items that were perseverated over and time-locked to the presentation of items that were perseverated into the next response. In the first analysis, we examined the hypothesis that a failure during the encoding of the current target leads to perseveration. This account predicts differences in the ERP waveform time-locked to the onset of the perseverated-over items compared with correctly recalled items, similar to those differences found in the typical subsequent- memory paradigm. The same failure during encoding should lead to both perseveration and other error types (e.g., nonperseverative intrusions, omissions), predicting similar ERP effects for both perseverated-over items as well as for target items that are not recalled but also not perseverated over.</p>
<p>Most theories agree that a problem in processing the current target item contributes to perseveration. We also tested whether differences in how the previous trial was processed could influence the probability of producing a perseveration. If perseverations can be caused by a problem in processing the previous trial, these processing differences may be indexed by differences in the ERP waveform time-locked to the initial presentation of items that are recalled and subsequently perseverated compared with items that were recalled but not perseverated.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were right-handed, native-English-speaking individuals from the University of Illinois community; 18 to 35 years old; and without a history of psychiatric or neuropsychological disorders. One participant was excluded because an insufficient numbers of perseverations were produced (&lt; 15). Data from 16 participants (10 female, 6 male) were analyzed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0956797612461450">
<title>Behavioral task</title>
<p>Participants performed an ISR task. Stimulus lists were created from a set of 18 five-letter words, each beginning with a different letter. The words had a frequency of less than 10 per million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612461450">Francis &amp; Kucera, 1982</xref>) and none rhymed. Lists consisted of six randomly ordered words. Individual words never appeared more than once per stimulus list and never appeared on consecutive lists.</p>
<p>On each trial, a fixation cross was displayed on a computer monitor for 1,000 ms, immediately followed by the stimulus words presented one at a time in lower case at the center of the monitor. Each word was shown for 600 ms, with a 200-ms blank period between words. Immediately after the final word, a fixation cross was displayed for 1,500 ms, after which recall was initiated. Participants responded by recalling and typing the first letter of each word in the order in which the words appeared. Each participant received 6 practice trials, followed by four 45-trial test blocks.</p>

<sec id="section4-0956797612461450">
<title>EEG recording and data processing</title>
<p>EEG was recorded with the Active Two active-electrode system from BioSemi (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Sixty-four Ag-AgCl electrodes were positioned in a nylon cap according to an extension of the international 10-20 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612461450">Chatrian, Lettich, &amp; Nelson, 1988</xref>). Electrodes were also placed at the left and right mastoids, 1 cm to the side of the external canthi of each eye, and below each eye. The EEG and electroocculogram (EOG) were continuously recorded using a reference-free procedure, amplified with a band-pass of 0.16 to 100 Hz, and sampled at a rate of 512 Hz. Off-line, the data were referenced to an average of the left and right mastoid recordings, low-pass-filtered at 30 Hz, and high-pass-filtered at 0.1 Hz. Epochs were created by taking the interval 200 ms prior to the onset of each word stimulus to 600 ms after and baseline correcting the EEG to the 200-ms prestimulus interval. Epochs containing small artifacts (changes of more than 200 µV from baseline) at the face electrodes or extreme artifacts (changes of more than 1,000 µV from baseline) at any of the 64 scalp electrodes were discarded (on average, 14.5% of all epochs).</p>

<title>Behavioral results</title>
<p>Overall, participants recalled 40% of the lists correctly (range: 21–62%) and produced 86% of the target items somewhere in the response (range: 79–93%). Participants produced an average of 119 intrusion errors, items that appeared in the response but not the stimulus (out of a maximum possible 1,080; range: 55–185). Of those intrusions, an average of 71% were possible perseveration errors in that they appeared in the previous stimulus list (range: 64–76%). For all 16 participants, intruded items appeared in the previous stimulus list more often than would be expected by chance (<italic>p</italic>s &lt; .005; see the Supplemental Material available online for details of the chance analysis), which indicates that all participants produced at least some perseverations.</p>

<sec id="section7-0956797612461450">
<title>ERP Analysis 1: encoding the current target</title>
<p>All analyses were conducted on ERPs time-locked to the presentation of the target word. In the first analysis, we compared target items that were subsequently forgotten—either perseverated over or otherwise incorrect—with items that were recalled correctly. Perseverated-over targets were items that were replaced by items that appeared in the previous stimulus list (e.g., the “P” in CMPVNF→CMBVNQ; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612461450">Table 1</xref>). On average, 49 perseverated-over targets were identified (range: 22–92). Other incorrect targets were items that did not appear in either the previous list or the previous response. Other incorrect targets consisted of those targets replaced by nonperseverative intrusions (e.g., the “F” in CMPVNF→CMBVN<underline>Q</underline>, in which the Q did not appear in the previous trial; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612461450">Table 1</xref>), within-list anticipations or perseverations (e.g., the “V” in NBJQLV→NBJQLN), or targets that were omitted (e.g., the “R” in LBNRSG→LBNSG). On average, 78 other incorrect targets were identified (range: 33–132).</p>
<p>ERPs for subsequently forgotten targets were compared with ERPs for correctly recalled targets. To control for effects of serial position (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612461450">Azizian &amp; Polich, 2007</xref>) and stimulus variables of the target word (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797612461450">van Petten, Kutas, Kluender, Mitchiner, &amp; McIsaac, 1991</xref>), we matched correctly recalled target items for each subsequently forgotten target in which the same item appeared in the same list position. For example, for the perseverated-over target “P” in CMPVNF→CMBVNQ, matched correctly recalled target items were cases in which a correctly recalled P appeared in the third position of the target list. Because different correctly recalled items were matched to each subsequently forgotten target, the ERPs for correctly recalled target items differed for the perseverated-over and other incorrect target-item types.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612461450">Figure 1a</xref> plots the grand-average ERPs for the perseverated-over and other incorrect items, and their corresponding correctly recalled targets at five midline electrode locations (Fpz, Fz, Cz, Pz, and Oz). For both error types, correctly recalled targets elicited a more positive waveform at frontal and frontopolar sites starting around 250 to 300 ms after stimulus onset compared with their subsequently forgotten targets. The scalp distribution of these mean amplitude differences in the time range of 250 to 600 ms show this pattern when correctly recalled targets are compared with both perseverated-over (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612461450">Fig. 1b</xref>) and other incorrect targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612461450">Fig. 1c</xref>). To test the reliability of these effects, we averaged mean amplitudes across Fpz and Fz during two time windows (early: 100–250 ms, late: 250–600 ms), for the two error-type conditions and compared their corresponding control conditions in a 2 (response type: subsequently forgotten vs. subsequently recalled) × 2 (target type: perseverated over vs. other incorrect) × 2 (time bin: early vs. late) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). A significant interaction was found between time bin and response type, <italic>F</italic>(1, 15) = 6.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. For the later time window, the mean amplitude was significantly higher for the subsequently recalled than for the subsequently forgotten targets (difference: 1.70 µV), <italic>F</italic>(1, 15) = 5.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, but for the earlier time window, the difference was not significant (difference: −0.04 µV), <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1.

<p>The magnitude of this subsequent-memory effect did not depend on subsequent-error type. For the later time window, the subsequent-memory effect for perseverated-over targets (2.06 µV) did not differ significantly from subsequent memory for other incorrect targets (1.34 µV), <italic>F</italic>(1, 15) = 1.05, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .3. Though there may be power limitations in our design, we were unable to identify times points or scalp locations in which subsequent-memory effects for perseverated-over targets differed significantly from subsequent memory effects for other incorrect targets. There is a clear neural signature during encoding that predicts whether or not that item will subsequently be recalled, but no evidence for a neural signature that predicts the type of error that will be subsequently produced.</p>

<title>ERP Analysis 2: encoding the perseverated item</title>
<p>A second analysis focused on how the perseverated item was processed during the previous trial. Subsequently perseverated items were items recalled during one trial and intruded into the following response. On average, 76 subsequently perseverated target items were identified (range: 36–117).

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>In ISR, participants perseverate items into the current response from the previous trial. Corresponding electrophysiological differences were found during encoding both for the item that is perseverated over and, during the previous trial, for the item that is perseverated. First, ERPs recorded at frontal-midline sites were more positive for correctly recalled targets than for subsequently forgotten targets, with the same effects regardless of whether or not the resulting error was a perseveration. Second, ERP differences were observed between correctly recalled items that were perseverated into the next response and correctly recalled items that were not perseverated.</p>
<p>The results of the first analysis provide the first evidence for subsequent-memory effects in ISR—a greater positivity for subsequently recalled items than for subsequently forgotten items. This pattern supports the typical account of perseveration errors in ISR, in which perseverations and other errors arise only when recall fails (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612461450">Estes, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612461450">Page &amp; Norris, 1998</xref>). Following the previous literature on subsequent memory effects, we interpret the less-positive ERP waveform to subsequently forgotten items as reflecting a failure to encode those items, which in turn causes problems during recall. Because these ERP differences do not depend on the type of error produced, it appears that the same failure during encoding that leads to perseverations can lead to other errors as well.</p>
<p>The results of the second analysis, however, indicate that weak encoding of the current target item is not the only factor that influences the probability of perseveration. The ERP differences found in the second analysis demonstrate that how the perseverating item is processed during the previous trial also influences the probability that a perseveration will occur. This pattern can be easily accounted for by theories of ISR in which traces of previous trials remain active and can exert an influence on the recall process, occasionally causing errors to occur; this pattern is difficult to reconcile with those theories in which only one list can be represented at a time. A complete account of how these two factors interact to cause perseverations remains an open question to be addressed in future work.</p>
<p>The results of the second analysis can also clarify the processing deficits during previous trials that cause an item to perseverate. Previous behavioral results have suggested that perseveration depends more on recall than encoding of previous lists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612461450">Henson, 1999</xref>). However, we can rule out problems during recall of the previous list as the sole driver of perseveration errors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612461450">Fischer-Baum &amp; Rapp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612461450">Hauser, 1999</xref>), as ERP differences for subsequently perseverated items were found during previous list encoding well before those items were recalled. We cannot rule out, from our analyses, that processing difficulties at recall contribute to perseveration. Head movements during recall forced us to limit our analyses to ERPs time-locked to encoding of the previous trial. Still, our results clearly show that an abnormality in how the perseverated item is encoded on one trial contributes to its perseveration into the next trial. We can also rule out that items that are subsequently perseverated are simply more strongly encoded when they are initially presented, causing them to remain more active even into the next response. A greater positivity for items that are subsequently recalled than for items that are subsequently forgotten has been taken to reflect stronger encoding (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612461450">Paller, McCarthy, &amp; Wood, 1988</xref>). The results of Analysis 2 show the opposite pattern, a greater positivity for items that were not perseverated than for items that were perseverated, which suggests that items that were perseverated into the next response were somehow encoded more weakly.</p>
<p>Unlike target items that are perseverated over, subsequently perseverated items are encoded strongly enough to be recalled correctly when they are initially presented. The ERP differences between the subsequently perseverated and not-perseverated items likely index some encoding failure other than the failure to encode the identity of the item. One possibility is that these ERP differences reflect a failure to bind the target item to contextual information (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612461450">Friedman &amp; Trott, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612461450">Mangels, Picton, &amp; Craik, 2001</xref>). Previous research has shown a greater positivity at the time of encoding for items that were later remembered, with rich contextual detail, compared with items that were later known without that contextual detail. These results demonstrate that less-positive ERP waveforms may reflect not only a problem in encoding item identity, but also a problem in linking the item to contextual detail.</p>
<p>The critical item-context binding necessary to prevent perseveration may be the binding of the target item to the appropriate list context, and the ERP differences observed in this experiment between subsequently perseverated and not-perseverated targets may reflect a failure in binding subsequently perseverated items to list context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612461450">Anderson (2005)</xref> argues that, after a recall trial is completed, items need to be deactivated in order to prepare for the next trial, and this deactivation targets the list context rather than individual items. According to this framework, the extent to which an individual item is inhibited at the end of a trial depends on how strongly it is bound to its list context. Items that are not strongly bound to their list context will not be properly inhibited and will thus remain active, which increases the possibility that they will be perseverated into the next response. List forgetting may not require deactivation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612461450">Sahakyan &amp; Kelley, 2002</xref>), but even without deactivation, a failure to bind items to a list context may lead to perseverations. For example, it may be difficult to discount items from a previous trial as not belonging to the current list if they were not properly bound to that prior list context in the first place, which increases the probability that these unbound items will intrude into the current response.</p>
<p>The proposal that items perseverate in part because they are not properly bound to their list contexts leads to a surprising prediction about individuals with bilateral hippocampal lesions. These lesions are thought to generally impair relational memory, including the binding of items to list contexts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612461450">Konkel &amp; Cohen, 2009</xref>, for a recent review). Given the proposal outlined here, these individuals should perseverate extensively in tasks that require producing items from the current trial, while discounting or deactivating those items associated with recent trials. Although more research is required, there is some evidence supporting this prediction. Much of the early animal research on the hippocampus found that bilateral lesions lead to a striking increase in perseveratory behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612461450">Douglas, 1967</xref>, for a review). At least in some tasks, humans with bilateral hippocampal damage have been shown to perseverate at abnormally high rates as well (e.g., reading aloud lists of low-frequency words and pseudowords; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612461450">MacKay &amp; James, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, whereas the present study focused on perseveration errors in the context of the ISR task, perseverative phenomena are widely reported in the literature across a variety of tasks and populations. Babies perseverate when reaching for a hidden object, searching the location in which the object had been hidden during a previous trial despite clearly seeing the experimenter hide the object in a different location on the current trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612461450">Smith et al., 1999</xref>). Aphasic individuals often perseverate when naming pictures, either repeating a whole response from previous trials (e.g., seeing a fork but responding “spoon” after naming a spoon on a previous trial; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612461450">Martin &amp; Dell, 2007</xref>) or blending elements from a previous response into the current one (e.g., seeing a star but responding “stale” after naming a nail on a previous trial; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612461450">Moses, Nickels, &amp; Sheard, 2004</xref>). Understanding why perseveration sometimes occurs has clear implications for theories of how people control irrelevant information, especially if the conclusions from ISR generalize to different circumstances in which perseverations occur. Although more work is needed to identify the causes of different types of perseveration, there is already some indication that the conclusions we drew from the present findings—that processing impairments that affect both the current target and the previous trial can lead to perseveration—apply to a broader range of perseveration types. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612461450">Fischer-Baum and Rapp (2012)</xref> report a dysgraphic individual who perseverates letters in spelling in a pattern that led them to argue for both a deficit in activating the current target word and a deficit in inhibiting the previously produced word. As understanding of the causes of perseveration across a range of situations improves, researchers may be able to identify some general properties of how the past competes with the present.</p>
