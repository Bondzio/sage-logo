<abstract>
<p>Nancy E. Betz is a deeply respected pioneer in the areas of vocational psychology, the career development of women, and measurement and vocational assessment. Her scholarship in these areas is recognized nationally and internationally and dates to her early, innovative collaboration with Gail Hackett to apply Bandura’s concept of self-efficacy to understand the vocational behavior of women. This interview traces the life and career stories of Nancy Betz and in doing so illustrates the personal and contextual influences that shaped the person and professional she was to become. Nancy’s story is a powerful illustration of a number of central themes of counseling psychology, including the critical importance of scientific rigor, humanistic values, social influences, and diverse perspectives.</p>

<p>Nancy E. Betz has spent her entire professional career as a member of the Department of Psychology at The Ohio State University (OSU); she arrived in 1976, just after finishing her doctorate. She is well known and has been widely recognized for her work in the area of vocational psychology, starting with her innovative and productive 1981 collaboration with Gail Hackett to apply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012450191">Bandura’s (1977)</xref> concept of self-efficacy to understand the vocational behavior of women. Nancy is also exceptionally well respected for her measurement expertise and contributions to vocational assessment and has been honored on numerous occasions for her contributions in those areas (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000012450191">Table 1</xref>). In the following interview, Nancy talks about her personal and career development and how her scholarly work has emerged from those experiences. (For the benefit of the reader, I have added reference citations to the text of this interview after the interview itself.)</p>

<p>Nancy asked me (Linda Subich) to write this article because I was one of her first PhD’s at OSU. Like Nancy, I pursued a career in vocational psychology and gender role research. Nancy felt that I had the unique perspective of having known her from her earliest years as an academic counseling psychologist, when she was scarcely older than her graduate students and, in fact, younger than some. I was terrified to be a graduate student, and unbeknownst to most of us, she was terrified to be a professor. So that I could write her personal as well as professional story, Nancy agreed to be interviewed by me. This interview introduces the reader to Nancy as a person and professional and to the themes that have guided her scholarship and professional life.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000012450191">
<title>Overview of the “Person”</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Linda Subich:</speaker>
<p>To start things out, I will ask the question, Who is Nancy Betz?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nancy Betz:</speaker>
<p>Well, first things first, I was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Ellen and Arthur Betz. I was a big (9-pound) happy baby who was content eating and sleeping, usually in that order. My parents were divorced before I was a year old, with my dad moving to Dallas for a job as a claims attorney and my mother soon relocating to Milwaukee (and later the Twin Cities) for a job with the Girl Scouts of the USA. I lived with my mom during the school year but would spend parts of summer vacation with my dad. He and my mother always behaved amicably toward each other, so I grew up loving and feeling very secure with them both. When I was 7, my dad and stepmother had the first of my three half siblings, so I was lucky enough to gain sibs, with whom I am very close to this day. I will describe my educational and career development and the factors influential in those later in our talk.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>LS:</speaker>
<p>So this is your background. How would you define yourself today?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>Well, I’m a university professor, just retired from teaching although still active in research and writing. I’m an animal lover and very strong environmentalist. I’m a feminist and am committed to social justice in this country and globally. I’m a musician. I’m a voracious reader. I’m a writer. I’m a bicyclist. And I treasure and would do most anything for my parents, my family, my friends, and my pets. I am rich in loving relationships.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>LS:</speaker>
<p>Are there three descriptors that capture your essence?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>These words would be <italic>honest, compassionate</italic>, and <italic>giving</italic>, happy and engaged in life.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0011000012450191">
<title>Education and Career Development</title>
<p>In vocational theory, interests, skills, and attitudes likely arise out of a combination of personal tendencies and environmental influences, with the balance between these influences characterized differently by different theorists and researchers. Nancy’s early influences reflect both of these domains, with a strong emphasis on the power of social learning via influential role models. The next section describes her important developmental influences.</p>
<sec id="section3-0011000012450191">
<title>Early Development</title>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>As I had mentioned, my parents were divorced when I was less than 1 year old. My father went south to Dallas. My mother went north to Milwaukee and then Minneapolis, where she pursued a career with the Girl Scouts of the USA. My parents had an amicable postdivorce relationship and communicated the same values to me. They both valued education. They both loved classical music. They were both voracious readers, advocates of nature and environmentalism, and they were both extremely liberal politically. There was no conflict between my parents’ respective value systems. I feel extremely lucky to have two wonderful parents. With my father’s remarriage, I also gained a kind and caring stepmother and three terrific half siblings.</p>
<p>Growing up, I was most interested in science and math and spent much free time engaged in constructing my own science experiments, in rock and insect collecting, and in learning all of the constellations. I was active in Girl Scouts, band, chorus, piano, and lots of sports. I worked for a woman stockbroker through high school, filing all of the “millions” of client documents that came in to her office. I was a voracious reader, and I remember very clearly seeking out biographies of eminent women scientists (e.g., Marie Curie) and doctors (e.g., Elizabeth Blackwell). I consider these to have been my first women role models.</p>
<p>When I was in eighth grade, my mother started graduate school in psychology at the University of Minnesota, specializing in counseling psychology. Ironically, my mom’s (Ellen) graduate school classes in statistics were happening at the same time as I was studying statistics for an eighth grade special project. So we learned statistics together, at least initially, before she moved on to advanced study. My mom received the PhD in psychology in 1968 and took a job at Iowa State University in the Psychology Department and Counseling Center.</p>

<title>College Career</title>
<speech>
<speaker>LS:</speaker>
<p>So how did you select your career?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>Math and science were my interests, so I had decided to be a medical doctor and help people. I knew that girls were supposed to help people. But this is where the “null environment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012450191">Betz, 1989</xref>) comes in. The high school guidance counselor told me that if I did that (became a medical doctor), I’d be “out of the marriage market.” And then, my biology advisor at a liberal arts college, where each student is supposed to get individualized attention, discouraged my attempts to come see him. The “last straw” as far as my medical school aspirations happened in my chemistry lab my sophomore year in college. We were working with ether. My lab partner got too close to her Bunsen burner. The ether ignited her lab coat and started to burn. As her lab partner, my duty was to pull the shower cord above our lab table, but I fainted instead, leaving it for my other classmates to respond to the emergency. I concluded right then that I didn’t have the “stomach” for medicine. So without active encouragement from my environment, I folded under the discouragement and gave up my medical school aspirations.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>LS:</speaker>
<p>So why psychology?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>Well, my father was a lawyer, and my mother by that time was a counseling psychologist; I knew very little beyond those two occupations. I was ignorant of the scope and nature of the occupational world. Had I taken the Strong Interest Inventory, an Investigative/Realistic/Conventional Holland code would have resulted (as it did when I took the Strong as a 1st-year graduate student). Like the Strong I took in graduate school, engineer would have been suggested, along with the sciences and quantitatively oriented occupations like economist, statistician, and actuary. But no one suggested I take the Strong (or any other interest inventory), because I didn’t talk to anyone about my distress. So I fell back on what my parents did: law and psychology. I knew I didn’t want to be a lawyer, so I decided to pursue psychology. That way, I also figured I could “help people” (then still a theme in my female stereotypic script). My information-impoverished, stereotype-limited career choice is a major factor in why I am today such a proponent of career assessment and counseling.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>LS:</speaker>
<p>So you changed your major to psychology?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>I transferred to the University of Minnesota as a junior because my small college did not have a strong psychology department. My original college had the classes structured around a lot of discussion and a lot of writing. This was not conducive to my doing well because, first, I was very shy and found it nearly impossible to speak up in discussions. This did not help my grades. And my public school had not been good at teaching writing. I was good in math and science, but I was an awful writer. So I couldn’t do well in the writing-heavy classes. And then, miraculously, I transferred to the University of Minnesota, the “capital city” of multiple-choice exams! I was in my element. I excelled and finally loved my studies.</p>
<p>Two important things happened my senior year of college. First, I wrote a senior thesis on Carl Rogers, whose work I had admired greatly. My thesis was a literature review of all of his work, his theory, his therapy. A nonempirical honors thesis in a major psychology department is probably the exception rather than the rule (if allowed at all), but at the time, they let me do that. I loved Carl Rogers, and I loved the idea of unconditional positive regard and unconditional self-regard. I loved his view that people were intrinsically good and worth valuing (all foundational values of counseling psychology, I might add (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000012450191">Packard, 2009</xref>). Second, I totally fell in love with Dave Weiss’s psychological measurement class. I did very well and began what would end up being the 5 most important learning years of my life, under the mentorship of David J. Weiss.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011000012450191">
<title>Graduate School</title>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>So, in a sense, that’s why I went into counseling psychology. There was some role modeling from my mother, but I truly did love Rogerian views of people. And I truly did love measurement. These are of course two of the philosophical cornerstones of the field of counseling psychology, along with career development and the healthy personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000012450191">Packard, 2009</xref>), which I have already discussed. So I applied to counseling psychology graduate programs; Dave Weiss wanted me to stay at Minnesota and work with him. I could think of nothing more rewarding for me.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>LS:</speaker>
<p>What are your recollections of graduate school at Minnesota, other than your rewarding work with David Weiss?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>I did not like counseling and totally lacked confidence in my skill (recall my IRC Holland code, without a whisper of Social). The spring quarter of my 1st year of graduate school, we started prepracticum, and I was rated the lowest performing student. So I decided to take a year off, and instead I took statistics and computer programming courses. I stayed in grad school, and I did research with Dave Weiss, but I avoided counseling itself. I finally started practicum my 3rd year of graduate school. Ironically, by that time, Louise Douce, who had started the program with me, was now a practicum supervisor and supervised me. She was absolutely a fabulous supervisor. So it was kind of ironic the way it worked out.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>LS:</speaker>
<p>You mention your adviser Dave Weiss, but did you have faculty women role models at Minnesota?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>The only woman faculty member I knew was L. Sunny Hansen, over at the College of Education. She taught a course on women’s career development, which was excellent, but other than Sunny, we psychology women students had to find women role models from other sources. So, Leona Tyler, considered a founder of our field, was our “hero.” We worshipped Leona Tyler. We read all of her many texts and articles; in those days, a majority of our classes used texts authored by Leona Tyler (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000012450191">Tyler, 1947</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012450191">1953</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012450191">1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000012450191">1963</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000012450191">1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000012450191">1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011000012450191">1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000012450191">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012450191">1983</xref>). Leona Tyler lived in Oregon (where she had retired), and although she was not present, she was a source of constant inspiration to me.</p>
<p>The other woman at Minnesota who I aspired to emulate was Jo-Ida Hansen, who was 1 year ahead of us in graduate school. Jo-Ida was doing excellent research with David Campbell, and we admired Jo-Ida Hansen immensely. So, my role models were Dave Weiss, Leona Tyler, my mother, and Jo-Ida Hansen.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>LS:</speaker>
<p>Did you have role models once you started your academic career?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>Well, first, I was very lucky to have wonderful male mentors and colleagues at Ohio State. Sam Osipow, our chair, worked constantly to increase the number of women on our faculty and was extremely supportive of me. Bruce Walsh, Ted Kaul, Lyle Schmidt, Don Dell, Frank Fletcher, Rich Russell, and Harold Pepinsky welcomed me to the faculty and answered all my questions, never suggesting to me that I was asking a dumb question. It was a marvelous environment in which my career could develop.</p>
<p>Although I was the only woman on the counseling faculty at that time, I had tremendous support from more senior women in Division 17, including Lenore Harmon, Naomi Meara, Jan Birk, Lucia Gilbert, and Jo-Ida Hansen. Lenore and Naomi were incredibly supportive of younger women. They were very good to us. Jan Birk, Lucia Gilbert, and Jo-Ida were more senior than me, and I looked up to them. Jan was very active in Division 17 before she retired; she was clearly one of the women who were leading the way, if you will, in terms of women. Those women really did get it all started.</p>
<p>And I was fortunate to have a terrific group of friends and collaborators at Ohio State. I was lucky enough to overlap with Louise Fitzgerald, Ruth Fassinger, Gail Hackett, Sandy Shullman, Louise Douce, and Karen Taylor. This was truly a rich environment.</p>
</speech>

<sec id="section6-0011000012450191">
<title>Research</title>
<speech>
<speaker>LS:</speaker>
<p>How did your research get started?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>After my own discouraging experiences as a young woman, I was interested in socialized barriers to women’s career development. I began with a major barrier, that of math anxiety, a concept which had recently been defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012450191">Fennema and Sherman (1977)</xref> at the University of Wisconsin. I developed a measure of math anxiety adapted from their work and found it pervasive in college students, especially college women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012450191">Betz, 1978</xref>). I had found my “calling!”</p>
<p>Then Gail Hackett and I integrated women’s career development with self-efficacy theory beginning in 1981 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012450191">Betz &amp; Hackett 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012450191">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000012450191">Hackett &amp; Betz, 1981</xref>). Gail Hackett was a faculty member in the counseling program in the College of Education at Ohio State. She was trained in the cognitive-behavioral tradition, while I was trained as a Minnesota trait-factor psychologist. One day we were having lunch, and she told me about the cognitive-behavioral (self-efficacy) theory of Albert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012450191">Bandura (1977)</xref> of Stanford University. When she told me about the concept of self-efficacy expectations, the four sources of efficacy information struck me as a promising way to treat math anxiety. Gail agreed concerning this potential. Between my knowledge of women’s career development and hers of self-efficacy, we achieved a whole that had been much more than the sum of the parts: the application of self-efficacy theory to the career development of women and, later, to the entire field of career development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012450191">Lent, Brown, &amp; Hackett, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012450191">2000</xref>). We blended the two, and the “rest is history.”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>LS:</speaker>
<p>So the key was that you went into a new area but used well-respected, well-tested theories. It is proof of the value of a good theory as a foundation.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>Exactly! And it helped that Gail and I both were interested in talking to people whose theoretical positions were different from our own. We each immediately saw the benefit of what the other one did, and it was a “eureka” moment. The idea is to talk to people who use different theories and see whether there is synergy in the blend. So that was one lucky lunch.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>LS:</speaker>
<p>So can you give us a summary of your major research contributions?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>Well, as I mentioned, a major aim of my work has been to propose ideas which can lead to the facilitation of the career development of women. I have focused on ways in which women can overcome the “null environment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012450191">Betz, 1989</xref>) that our society represents. All of my work on women’s career development (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012450191">Betz, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012450191">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012450191">Betz &amp; Fitzgerald, 1987</xref>) and applications of Bandura’s self-efficacy theory to women’s career development (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012450191">Betz &amp; Hackett, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012450191">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012450191">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000012450191">Hackett &amp; Betz, 1981</xref>) is directed toward that aim.</p>
<p>But in addition to being committed to the broadening of women’s career options, I have always loved measurement and statistics, and I am never happier as when I am constructing a new scale, usually in the general area of self-efficacy but including a number of traits related to a “healthy personality,” one of my other passions. Among the measures of self-efficacy I have developed are the Career Decision Self-Efficacy Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012450191">Betz, Hammond, &amp; Multon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012450191">Betz, Klein, &amp; Taylor, 1996</xref>), the Mathematics Self-Efficacy Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012450191">Betz &amp; Hackett, 1983</xref>), the Skills Confidence Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012450191">Betz, Harmon, &amp; Borgen, 1996</xref>), the Social Self-Efficacy Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000012450191">Lin &amp; Betz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000012450191">Smith &amp; Betz, 2000</xref>), and the CAPA Confidence Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012450191">Betz &amp; Borgen 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012450191">Borgen &amp; Betz, 2008</xref>). With my colleagues Fred Borgen and Lenore Harmon, I have written on the use of conjointly interpreted measures of vocational interests and career self-efficacy in career counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012450191">Betz &amp; Borgen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012450191">Betz, Borgen, &amp; Harmon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012450191">Borgen &amp; Betz, 2011</xref>). In the area of the healthy personality, my coauthors and I have developed the Unconditional Self-Regard Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012450191">Betz, Serling, Wohlgemuth, Harshbarger, &amp; Klein, 1995</xref>), based on Rogerian theory, the Psychological Hardiness Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000012450191">Younkin &amp; Betz, 1996</xref>), and the Healthy Personality Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012450191">Betz &amp; Borgen, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012450191">Borgen &amp; Betz, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>My work on career self-efficacy and on measurement has received the most international attention. My or our scales have been translated into about 20 different languages, including Turkish and Arabic. I receive an average of one e-mailed request per day for one of my measures, for use on the requestor’s research or dissertation or thesis. At least half of these are international in origin. In addition to frequent correspondence with scholars in China, Hong Kong, Australia, Israel, Italy, and Portugal, recent requestors have been from such locations as Vilnius University in Lithuania; Olomouc in the Czech Republic; SNDT University in Pune, India; Putra University in Malaysia; the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences; Kasetsart University in Thailand; the University of Karachi in Pakistan; and the library of Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am always a bit surprised when I get a request from someone in a war-torn country; I heard from scholars in both Serbia and Croatia in the 1990s, and I currently hear from scholars in Iraq, Iran, and several other Middle Eastern countries. I have huge admiration for these people, continuing to do their scholarly work even amidst the ever present fear of violence.</p>
<p>Finally, I love facilitating the career development of college students, especially those finding themselves undecided or floundering. Along with Deborah Serling, I developed a measure of fear of commitment in college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012450191">Betz &amp; Serling, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000012450191">Serling &amp; Betz, 1990</xref>). Most recently, Fred Borgen and I used the CAPA Career Exploration System with 1,000 undecided Ohio State freshmen; we found that the system helped to increase career decision self-efficacy and led to greater decidedness for college major (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012450191">Betz &amp; Borgen, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012450191">2010a</xref>).</p>
</speech>
<p>Later, Nancy discussed how her teaching and research activities have changed since the closing of OSU’s counseling psychology program. Even these changes, though, seem consistent with her long-standing interests and abilities.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>Since OSU Counseling Psychology closed, I needed to reinvent myself. Fortunately, I was asked to join the quantitative area. When I was in graduate school, Dave Weiss strongly encouraged me to go into quantitative rather than counseling. I persisted in choosing counseling because of the value system, which as I have already mentioned, I loved. So my career choice was to be in a counseling psychology graduate program, and I was tremendously lucky to join the faculty at Ohio State. But I had always also loved measurement and statistics, and I taught measurement, research methods, and career assessment in our counseling psychology graduate program. So the transition to the quantitative area was an easy one, and my colleagues there have been very welcoming. I have been teaching Introductory Statistics again and also both undergraduate testing and graduate-level measurement.</p>

<title>On Her Commitment to Students and the Profession</title>
<p>Nancy made clear throughout the interview that her commitment to her students—graduate students and undergraduate students—and the profession of counseling psychology remains strong, even though she is now housed in quantitative psychology. With regard to counseling psychology, she noted that the focus of her activities has changed since the program at OSU closed.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>My last few years, after the closing of the counseling psychology graduate program, have been devoted to helping maintain a strong counseling psychology identity at Ohio State. We still teach Introduction to Counseling Psychology to 120 to 140 students a quarter, including summer. That’s 800 students a year who we hope to introduce to our field. Dr. Alisa Paulsen, who was one of my PhDs, teaches it often, as do others of our local counseling psychology PhD’s, including Eric Currence, Colby Srsic, and Bobbie Celeste. We have about 2,000 psychology majors presently, and many of them are very talented, academically and interpersonally. And we hope to continue sending some of them to good graduate programs in counseling psychology, so that the Ohio State tradition can be carried forward by our undergraduates!</p>

<sec id="section8-0011000012450191">
<title>Advice to Graduate Students and New Professionals</title>
<p>There were a couple of points during the interview when it was clear that Nancy wanted to share her wisdom gleaned from years in the profession with students and newer professional colleagues. In both cases, the advice speaks to facilitating common “rough patches” experienced by students and early career professionals.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>To graduate students: Keep your options open while in graduate school. When I started graduate school, my intent was to counsel, to help people, but it soon became very clear to me that not only was counseling not something I felt comfortable doing, but that I instead loved research and teaching. I hadn’t really known that before I worked with Dave Weiss. The message is, “Keep your options open through graduate school. There may be things that you find out about that you never would have felt really passionate about, or things you thought you wanted to do that now you don’t want to do.” Graduate school was really a tremendous time for learning new possibilities.</p>
<p>To everyone: We aren’t born knowing how to write well; good writing skills take practice—<italic>lots</italic> of practice. I was not a “natural” writer but developed the skill in graduate school while working with Dave Weiss. Dave Weiss at first corrected every word I wrote. He made his corrections in red ink, so that there was very little black remaining after he gave it back to me. I rewrote and rewrote some more—practice, practice, practice. I am a good writer today (and love it), but only because of the help of Dave Weiss and practice, practice, practice. And I have found that at certain points, when for one reason or another I went several months without writing, I have lost some of my otherwise strong self-efficacy for writing. I had to really force myself to get back to it. So I try not to let too much time without writing something (anything will do!), because I’ve seen colleagues who stopped writing for a period of time and couldn’t get going again. I haven’t wanted that to happen to me, but it has a couple of times. For me, I think that writing is something that I need to keep doing regularly so as not to lose my confidence.</p>
<p>To new professionals: Ask more senior college for advice or help. Remember that graduate school does not teach you everything you need to know on the job. I remember when I was asked to serve on my first oral exam committee at Ohio State. I had little idea of what I was supposed to do, because our exam process had been different at Minnesota. I asked Don Dell, one of our faculty. He was very gracious and told me what my role and responsibilities were. Don and my other colleagues made it clear that there wasn’t a silly question, and that I should never be afraid to ask. By this process I learned to be a faculty member.</p>
<p><italic>Most</italic> important: Learn to say “no.” New faculty are especially prone to want to help everyone who asks. This may be especially true for young women and faculty of color, who may be “tokens” in their environments and see the huge need for someone like themselves. But what you must keep in your mental foreground at all times is the need to do what you need to do to keep your job (or get tenure); if you fail in this, you will no longer be able to help any of these people. The people you want to help will be most grateful if <italic>you</italic> survive for the long haul: You can do much more good in the space of a long career than you can in a few short years where you helped everyone but yourself! Don’t be so generous with your time that you end up losing the ultimate battle!</p>
<p>One strategy that helped me was to enlist a “no buddy”: a friend or colleague whose permission I needed to get before I could say “yes” to a request. It is even more help if your “no buddy” is somewhere else, maybe in a different time zone. There are of course requests to which you should probably say “yes,” perhaps those from a chair or dean, but your default response should be “no” rather than “yes!” If you are unsure as to whether a request from a chair or dean should receive one of those “yeses,” ask a more senior colleague you trust for advice.</p>
<p>Get to know people nationally: Talk to people at conferences, go to their talks and poster sessions. Keep in touch with them by sending them your papers. Get involved at some regional or national level, though not so extensively that you violate your resolve to say “no” more often than “yes.”</p>
</speech>
<p>I would add to this advice some advice Nancy gave me as I shared with her my fears about pursuing an academic career. I was on internship in late 1980 and was discovering that I did not like working in a full-time practice setting as much as I had thought I would; I missed the academic environment and the intellectual stimulation of doing and talking about research. I had no self-efficacy, however, for an academic career and worried in one telephone conversation with Nancy about my ability to be successful as an academic. I couldn’t stop thinking about “publish or perish.” I will never forget (and we often laugh about) the advice she offered me, “Linda, you know you really don’t <italic>perish</italic> if you don’t publish—you just get a different job!”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0011000012450191">
<title>On Looking to the Future of the Field</title>
<p>Near the end of the interview, I asked Nancy to comment on the future of the field and any troublesome aspects. She noted the current challenges with regard to the internship imbalance, the ever more competitive academic environment, and the demand that faculty members obtain grant funding. She did not feel that the closure of the OSU program (one of the original “MOMM” schools—Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio State, and Maryland; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012450191">Goldman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012450191">Horan, Weber, Fitzsimmons, Maglio, &amp; Hanish, 1993</xref>) was of concern, as many new programs are developing and earning American Psychological Association accreditation, even as OSU and a few others have closed. Rather, she feels that the many new directions for counseling psychology make it a more exciting field than ever before.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>NB:</speaker>
<p>There are a lot of new directions for our field. I hope that the field of educational and career development will always be healthy, because people’s need to make good choices in matters of education and career will endure. But I think we’re focusing a lot more on college student mental health thanks to the terrible tragedies such as at Virginia Tech. It’s being seen as increasingly important. I’ve always loved college student development and mental health, and it’s really becoming an important issue for research.</p>
<p>And of course I love the fact that Division 17 has led the way in the focus on women’s, multicultural, and LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender] issues. There’s also the new interest in animal-human interaction, which I think is tremendously important and promising for mental health. Significantly more attention is being focused on the mental health and rehabilitation of returning veterans. And gerontology is a major direction for counseling psychologists, with more and more postdocs and hospital positions available. Former students of mine have held positions as chiefs of gerontology at medical schools and have done hospital and VA [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] postdocs in gerontology and palliative care. All of these directions provide an exciting and important future for the field of counseling psychology.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This interview with Nancy Betz highlights quite a number of common threads that weave their way through her career and life. Probably most life stories have certain threads that are consistent, but it seems that there are quite a number of common threads in Nancy’s stories, themes that are there from the beginning and that periodically reappear. Her love of science, math, and measurement appeared early in her development and has guided her research, teaching, and training activities from the beginning of her career to the present. The importance of strong female role models—Leona Tyler, her mother Ellen Betz, and later her female mentors and contemporaries—foreshadowed her mentorship over the years of young women and men in the field. Finally, her early identification of her humanistic values proved to be a perfect fit for her choice of counseling psychology as a career.</p>
<p>In sum, the life story of Nancy Betz illustrates in a powerful manner how a consistent, well-differentiated set of interests, skills, and values, when fit into a supportive environment, can produce tremendous achievements and contributions. She also exemplifies the powerful effects of comingling humanistic values with solid scientific and methods expertise, a blend that may be especially characteristic of the profession of counseling psychology.</p>
