<abstract>
<p>This article presents a cognitive–cultural model (CC model) of situational, dispositional, and motivational factors affecting gender-associational responses to lexical expressions concerning people. It is argued that the mind is trained to perceive gender as an indispensable human feature. When decoding the meaning of a message, it will search for cues of gender, usually prioritizing the semantic content. When gender is not clearly specified, the mind attempts to plausibly reconstruct missing data by referring to indirect extrasemantic cues. This often occurs beyond conscious recognition. Lexical cues are strongly influential owing to their direct association with semantic gender-specific meaning. Gender-associational dispositions resulting from cognitive training also affect the response. This article discusses cognitive training’s cultural, gender-related, and individual components, along with dispositional and incidental factors, affecting motivation to consciously authorize and/or alter the initial automatic response.</p>

<p>In numerous languages masculine lexical forms can be understood not only as having gender-specific but also generic meaning. Feminine lexical forms usually are semantically gender-specific. The generic masculine, in comparison to alternative generic constructions, has been documented to evoke male bias in recipients’ gender associations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12463008">Bojarska, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463008">Braun, Sczesny, &amp; Stahlberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261927X12463008">Hamilton, Hunter, &amp; Stuart-Smith, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12463008">Hyde, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X12463008">MacKay &amp; Fulkerson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261927X12463008">Moulton, Robinson, &amp; Elias, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261927X12463008">Stahlberg, Braun, Irmen, &amp; Sczesny, 2007</xref>), but the latter depend also on other factors, such as the recipient’s gender (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12463008">Bojarska, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463008">Braun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X12463008">Crawford &amp; English, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261927X12463008">Gabriel &amp; Mellenberger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261927X12463008">Moulton et al., 1978</xref>) and the stimulus categories’ associations with gender stereotypes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12463008">Bojarska, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463008">Braun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X12463008">Gygax &amp; Gabriel, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This article proposes a comprehensive cognitive–cultural model (CC model) of the situational, dispositional, and motivational factors that play role in responding to lexical stimuli with gender associations. It attempts to integrate the findings from linguistic studies and cognitive psychology and to relate them to cultural context. It explains some previously observed effects and serves as a source of testable predictions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0261927X12463008">
<title>The CC Model</title>
<p>To be comprehended, incoming information must be related to the cognitive structures already stored in the mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12463008">Bransford &amp; Johnson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X12463008">Dunning &amp; Sherman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X12463008">Kintsch, 1988</xref>). The mind activates relevant cognitive structures by focusing on the directly available semantic information (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X12463008">Fiske, 2004</xref>) and makes inferences about any indispensable missing or overlooked information based on indirect cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12463008">Bargh &amp; Pietromonaco, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X12463008">Dunning &amp; Sherman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X12463008">Kintsch, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261927X12463008">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974</xref>), even entirely incidental ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X12463008">Higgins &amp; Bargh, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261927X12463008">Higgins, Bargh, &amp; Lombardi, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>The CC model assumes that the human mind is trained to treat gender as an indispensable human feature, since in people’s cognitive experience genderless persons are virtually never encountered (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12463008">Bradshaw, Clegg, &amp; Trayhurn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261927X12463008">Mucchi-Faina, 2005</xref>). Therefore, when activating a cognitive representation of a person, if direct semantic information about gender is missing, the mind, compelled to infer about gender, will likely resort to extrasemantic cues and the final gender-associational response will be negotiated among them.</p>
<p>The model predicts that gender-associational responses to lexical stimuli depend on a combination of factors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X12463008">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Accessibility of Cognitive Resources</title>
<p>Information can be processed in either an automatic or conscious way. The automatic mode is activated unintentionally in response to incoming stimuli, and it follows a pattern of habitual responses reinforced by previous repeated activation. Conscious attention or effort is not involved, as the selection and activation of cognitive structures is entirely automatic. This mode is preferred by the mind, as it is sufficient for responding to typical situations, while allowing for economizing cognitive resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12463008">Devine, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261927X12463008">Schneider &amp; Shiffrin, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261927X12463008">Shiffrin &amp; Schneider, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Given enough motivation and cognitive resources, people are capable of consciously suppressing automatic responses and selecting more controllable ones. The conscious mode requires attention and cognitive effort, and its initiation is intentional. This mode is usually chosen only if necessary (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X12463008">Fiske, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X12463008">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12463008">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991</xref>). The absence of sufficient cognitive resources will prevent individuals from exerting conscious control over their cognitive processes. In such a case, the individual will respond in an automatic, habitual way (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12463008">Cralley &amp; Ruscher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12463008">Devine, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>When decoding lexical information, cognitive resources may be limited by cognitive business, tiredness, and disinterest in a given task or other distractors. Sometimes they might be insufficient to allow for even an automatic response, which may result in overlooking directly available semantic information and lead to serious misunderstandings (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261927X12463008">Schneider &amp; Shiffrin, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261927X12463008">Shiffrin &amp; Schneider, 1977</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0261927X12463008">
<title>Direct Semantic Message Content</title>
<p>According to the CC model, the mind initially attempts to refer to the direct semantic content of the message in search of gender cues. If gender is clearly defined (<italic>a male nurse</italic>) or can be easily deduced in the semantic context (<italic>a breastfeeding patient</italic>), gender-specific meaning will be concluded. Any gender-incongruent extrasemantic cues (e.g., the feminized stereotype of a <italic>nurse</italic>) may, however, slow down the response time (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463008">Braun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X12463008">Irmen, 2007</xref>), trigger motivation to switch into the conscious information-processing mode, or—if the cues are strong enough—even lead to misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Several types of lexical constructions are used in messages regarding people. They might hint at one or two plausible genders, or they may contain no semantic cues of gender whatsoever (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261927X12463008">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Extrasemantic Gender Cues</title>
<sec id="section5-0261927X12463008">
<title>Lexical Cues</title>
<p>Lexical gender markers are particularly frequent in grammatically gendered languages. They are expected to be suggestive of plausible gender due to their prevalent coincidence and, consequently, strong association with gender-specific meanings (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463008">Braun et al., 2005</xref>). If lexical cues are not indicative of either gender, the selection of plausible gender will be based on a combination of other factors.</p>
<sec id="section6-0261927X12463008">
<title>Gender-specific meaning of lexical structures</title>
<p>In some languages (e.g., English), lexical references to gender are confined to nouns and pronouns that emerged expressly to denote people of a particular gender. In many others (e.g., German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish), every noun is assigned grammatical gender, regardless of whether it actually bears any gender-specific meaning, denotes an animated, unanimated, physical, or abstract object (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463008">Braun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261927X12463008">Mucchi-Faina, 2005</xref>). In some languages, there are two grammatical genders—feminine and masculine. In others there are three or more—usually masculine, feminine, and neuter. Nouns are always referred to with respective pronouns: <italic>he, she</italic>, or <italic>it</italic>. Grammatically neuter people-denoting words seem to be relatively rare. In this group of languages, almost all words denoting or describing people (names of professions, social functions, or people’s situational roles) are semantically associated with some gender-specific meaning.</p>
<p>The grammatical gender of a noun usually affects the other parts of speech that describe it (articles, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and/or numerals), which assume grammatically masculine, feminine, or neuter versions or inflections that agree with the grammatical gender of the noun they describe (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261927X12463008">Mucchi-Faina, 2005</xref>). Consequently, lexical references to gender are incomparably more frequent in grammatically gendered languages than in languages free from a grammatical gender system (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463008">Braun et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The association of lexical gender markers with their gender-specific semantic meaning should constitute a salient cue of plausible gender if clear semantic gender cues are missing, even if a gender marked expression is intended as generic. This might explain why lexically masculine words intended as generic are actually treated as suggestive of the masculine gender.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0261927X12463008">
<title>Grammatical gender of people-denoting expressions</title>
<p>In grammatically gendered languages, usually only a narrow group of people-denoting epicene words are free from any gender-specific meaning (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261927X12463008">Mucchi-Faina, 2005</xref>). From the semantic point of view, they are gender-irrelevant; however, they still have grammatical gender.</p>
<p>Epicene words, even if intended as gender-neutralizing variants of generic expressions, may be unintentionally suggestive of the gender indicated in their grammatical gender, unless they are lexically neuter.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0261927X12463008">
<title>Dispositional Associations of Social Categories With Gender</title>
<p>Cognitive representations of social groups can be mentally associated with gender schemas. When a given social category is activated in the mind, the associated gender becomes relatively more cognitively accessible (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463008">Braun et al., 2005</xref>). The strength of association between two cognitive categories is assumed to depend on the individual history of their previous simultaneous activation.</p>
<p>If a persońs gender is not expressly denoted in a message, then either their social identity can be clearly defined (<italic>a nurse</italic>) or the cues of social categorization can be open to the recipient’s interpretation (<italic>someone knocking on your door</italic>). In the latter case, the mind should attempt to infer social categorization as well. The social category can become a major source of inferences about their members’ perceived “typical” or plausible gender (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12463008">Bargh &amp; Pietromonaco, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X12463008">Dunning &amp; Sherman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X12463008">Kintsch, 1988</xref>). The more a given social category is associated with gender, the more likely it is to serve as a source of tacit inferences.</p>
<sec id="section9-0261927X12463008">
<title>Exposure to cultural depictions of social categories</title>
<p>Cultural depictions of social groups can be found in everyday communication, including language itself. They affect personal knowledge about the society (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X12463008">Karlins, Coffman, &amp; Walters, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261927X12463008">Katz &amp; Braly, 1933</xref>) and are capable of reinforcing associations with gender.</p>
<p>There are two self-reinforcing, socially transmitted cultural–cognitive phenomena assumed to serve as major sources of influence on associations of social categories with gender.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0261927X12463008">
<title>Gender stereotypes</title>
<p>Gender stereotypes seem to reflect the traditional social order that emerged when people had little choice as to their gender roles (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12463008">Eagly, 1987</xref>). Stereotypical depictions of men and women shape expectations that fuel socializing differences. This constitutes a positive feedback loop between cognitive perceptions of social order and the actual social order, which reproduces gender roles and stereotypes.</p>
<p>Stereotypes seem to both affect and be affected by language. When traditional functions or occupations were named, the invented terms tended to correspond semantically and/or lexically with people’s actual gender. Traditionally feminine and masculine occupations or social functions are still frequently referred to with semantically and lexically feminine or masculine words, respectively. The latter, however, have been declared to have generic meaning (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463008">Braun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261927X12463008">Mucchi-Faina, 2005</xref>). It is asserted that the lexical ways social categories are referred to can reinforce their associations with gender.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0261927X12463008">
<title>Cultural androcentrism</title>
<p>Androcentrism seems to reflect the male-dominated perceptions of the male-dominated social reality and constitutes people’s propensity to perceive the male as the normative and most prevalent type of person, whereas the female is seen as peripheral and deviating from the norm constituted by masculinity. It is manifested in the long-standing tradition of a disproportionately large part of social communication being dominated by male-related content (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12463008">Amare, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12463008">Bradshaw et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X12463008">Dyrud 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261927X12463008">Ernst, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X12463008">Fuertes-Olivera, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261927X12463008">Hamilton, Anderson, Broaddus, &amp; Young, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261927X12463008">Patt &amp; McBride, 1993</xref>). People associate a typical human more strongly with the masculine rather than the feminine gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X12463008">Hamilton, 1991</xref>). This demonstrates that perceptions of social reality can be distorted by the influence of cultural–cognitive factors, despite the actual category of a human being almost perfectly gender balanced (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12463008">Bojarska, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Androcentrism seems to have been translated into the emergence of the generic masculine. Perhaps men could have initially viewed themselves as the exclusive referents of the concept of a “person,” whereas women were regarded as “another kind” of beings. The division of the social world into “people and women” seems to be the actual gist of androcentrism and of the generic masculine. This way of thinking is evident in the language of the Bible (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261927X12463008">Marlowe, 2005</xref>) and it persists today among some speakers. In any case, masculine lexical forms have been eventually declared to have the contemporary generic meaning.</p>

<sec id="section12-0261927X12463008">
<title>Gender-related cognitive training</title>
<p>The CC model assumes that much of the social world is understood by relating incoming information to one’s personal experience or self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261927X12463008">Markus, 1977</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0261927X12463008">
<title>Relevance of individual social categories to one’s self-concept</title>
<p>People usually self-identify with some social categories (one’s gender, occupation, the category of a human/person; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261927X12463008">Garza &amp; Herringer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261927X12463008">Markus, 1977</xref>). These categories are expected to be activated relatively more frequently than others, and they should become relatively more associated with one another than with any other categories unrelated to one’s self-concept. As gender belongs to identity categories, self-identity-related gender bias is expected to develop in both men and women. Women socialized in an androcentric society are still predicted to be male-biased, but less so than men are. Their cognitive training should, nevertheless, lessen the cultural androcentric influences’ impact on shaping thought processes, whereas meńs cognitive training should reinforce them.</p>

<title>Disposition to recognize masculine lexical constructions as generic or gender-specific</title>
<p>Whether people tend to resolve the ambiguity of masculine lexical expressions in favor of generic or gender-specific meaning might be affected by cognitive training related to one’s gender.</p>
<p>Men virtually never need to solve semantic riddles to determine whether lexical constructions are inclusive for people of their own gender (i.e., themselves). Semantic cues in this respect are usually clear. Lexically feminine forms are clearly not intended to include men. Gender-balancing and gender-neutral constructions contain no semantic cues of potential exclusion. As long as self-concept is involved, men do not need to distinguish how lexically masculine constructions should be understood. They are men-inclusive in either case. Meanwhile, women are frequently exposed to ostensibly foreign masculine lexical constructions of semantic ambiguity. Although lexically feminine, gender-balancing and gender-neutral lexical constructions are semantically women-inclusive, they constitute only a fraction of verbal references to people, a significant portion of which have been dominated by lexically masculine constructions. If women treated them simply as excluding people of their own gender, they would often have to feel semantically excluded from the category of “people in general.” If women, instead, assumed that all masculine lexical constructions are semantically gender-inclusive, they would soon discover that this is not always the case (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463008">Braun et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>That is why women should, more often than men, feel motivated to determine the intended meaning of masculine lexical constructions. They should develop more sensitivity, at least at the operational information-processing, rather than declarative, level (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X12463008">Gygax, Gabriel, Sarrasin, Oakhill, &amp; Garnham, 2009</xref>), to the possible double meaning of masculine lexical constructions. This might translate into womeńs relatively lower susceptibility to masculine-generic-related male bias, that is, stronger tendency to treat women as legitimate referents of masculine lexical expressions in comparison to men (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X12463008">Bem &amp; Bem, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12463008">Bojarska, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X12463008">Crawford &amp; English, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261927X12463008">Gabriel &amp; Mellenberger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261927X12463008">Moulton et al., 1978</xref>). The extent to which the activation of this awareness becomes habitual or requires cognitive effort needs to be determined empirically.</p>

<sec id="section15-0261927X12463008">
<title>Individual cognitive experience. Salience or distribution of gender among people perceived as members of particular categories</title>
<p>Exposure to members of a given category (or even a single person) may lead to establishing a mental association of the entire category with a gender that one has perceived as prevailing among the group members. This can lead to distorted perceptions of gender representation if unsubstantial generalizations are made (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X12463008">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1971</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0261927X12463008">
<title>Personal history of gender-inclusive language usage</title>
<p>Depending on previous experience and personal beliefs, some people are more sensitive than others to issues of lexical inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261927X12463008">Swim, Mallett, &amp; Stangor, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Language-sensitive individuals who have previously received traditional cognitive training are predicted to have developed similarly strong associations between lexical and semantic gender cues as did most other people (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12463008">Devine, 1989</xref>). At the automatic cognitive information processing level they should fall victim to the gender-perceptions-biasing potential of lexical expressions comparably easily, but they should feel significantly more motivated to authorize consciously their automatic cognitive responses. If cognitive resources are sufficient, they might consciously regulate their possibly gender-biased responses to lexical stimuli. However, in the absence of sufficient cognitive resources or triggers of motivation for conscious control, they should respond to verbal expressions comparably to others. Language-disinterested individuals, on the other hand, should respond in a similar way, regardless of whether cognitive resources are sufficient to allow for conscious self-authorization (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12463008">Cralley &amp; Ruscher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12463008">Devine, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Paradoxically, in individuals who have been using gender-inclusive language long enough to develop a habit (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12463008">Cralley &amp; Ruscher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261927X12463008">Legault, Green-Demers, &amp; Eadie, 2009</xref>), if conditions do not allow for conscious authorization of one’s automatic response, exposure to generic masculine may lead to even more male-biased responses than would be returned by people untrained in lexical inclusion, because of the strongly reinforced habit of perceiving these constructions as exclusively gender-specific. Other people would still perceive masculine constructions as at least partly generic (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463008">Braun et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0261927X12463008">
<title>Incidental Cues</title>
<p>Mental availability of cognitive schemas can be affected by seemingly unrelated factors, often operating beyond conscious recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12463008">Bargh &amp; Pietromonaco, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12463008">Devine, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261927X12463008">Higgins et al., 1985</xref>). Therefore, gender associations can also be affected by incidental factors, such as visual or auditory stimuli, or priming by recently activated gender-associated cognitive elements, for example, fresh memories.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0261927X12463008">
<title>Motivation for Conscious Authorization of the Automatic Response</title>
<p>Decoding verbal messages is usually initiated without conscious thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X12463008">Dunning &amp; Sherman, 1997</xref>). A motivation to switch to the conscious mode may arise when the mind encounters a cognitive obstacle to solving a particular cognitive task in an automatic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12463008">Devine, 1989</xref>) or when some other triggers of conscious attention are encountered. A conscious decision then has to be made whether to focus attention and increase cognitive effort in an attempt to find a new response (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X12463008">Fiske, 2004</xref>) or whether to ignore the triggering stimulus and, possibly, render the problem unsolved.</p>
<p>A motivation to resist the automatic response’s influence on behavior might arise from dispositional gender-inclusive language sensitivity (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12463008">Devine, 1989</xref>) or can be activated by external stimuli, such as task instruction or exposure to unusual lexical expression, which interrupt the habitual thinking route.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is also possible that the gender reassignment of the initially envisaged person will reflect a conscious modification of the initial response made for reasons unrelated to this persońs gender.</p>

<title>Predictions Regarding Inferences About Gender From Different Types of Interacting Cues</title>
<p>If a persońs gender is not expressly denoted, both lexical and social-category associated gender cues, along with incidental factors, should constitute influential sources of inferences about plausible gender. If several types of extrasemantic cues are present, the plausibility of gender is negotiated between them, either at the automatic or the conscious level. This can occur in numerous combinations, many of which are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0261927X12463008">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The proposed CC model emphasizes the multidirectional and self-reinforcing relationships among social structure, culture, language, gender, biographical experience, and cognitive processes. It demonstrates how combinations of these factors may influence gender associations, and how cognitive processes may actually shape social reality by means of social transmission and maintain the impact of historical events on contemporary culture, language, and cognition.</p>
<p>The model explains some existing research findings and allows for the formulation of testable predictions. Further research can help improve our understanding of the relative contribution of the combinations of respective factors in evoking gender-associational responses to lexical stimuli.</p>
